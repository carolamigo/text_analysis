OCTOBER 1995 As Kinesis goes to press, Ontario  women and poor people are bracing  themselves for a lot more hard times to  come, as the right-wing Conservative  government of Mike Harris gets set to  announce major cuts to social programs  and other regressive policies that target  women, poor people, working class people, and immigrants [see story on page 7.]  Following on the heels of Alberta's  Ralph Klein, Harris promised during  the provincial election thathe would cut  government spending by $6 billion. Now  Harris is saying that his government  plans to cut even more—$3 billion more.  After already promising to slash  more than 20 percent off social assistance, and to cutback on affordable housing, legal aid, daycare, funding to service agences, and so on...the question is:  what's left to slash? The answer Harris  will likely have for women and poor  people in Ontario is probably pretty,  pretty scary.  Moving back west to another Conservative government's attack on women's equality...Ralph Klein took another  step in curtailing women's reproductive  rights in Alberta—not that this comes as  a great surprise. Klein recently announced that his Conservative government will stop paying for abortion services, except in cases where abortion is  "medically necessitated." So that leaves  women in Alberta no longer with the  right to access abortion services in the  province...unless of course, they have  enough cash to pay for it themselves.  Here's a notable quote from Bob  Packwood, the Oregan senator who was  forced to resign after the Senate's ethics  committee admonished him for sexually harassing 40 women: In defending  himself in his goodbye speech to the  Senate, Packwood proved he has no clue  what sexual harassment is: "I am accused of kissing women, on occasion  perhaps over-eagerly kissing women,  and that is the charge. Not drugging.  Not robbing. Kissing." Well...we think  we'll just leave that quote without any  further comment.  As Kinesis goes to press, the 30,000  or so women who attended the4th World  Conference on Women in Beijing and  the NGO Women's Forum in Huairou  are probably busy sorting through all  the things that happened over the 16  days in China.  Over the next two issues of Kinesis,  we'll be producing special supplements  to bring you interviews, overviews and  analysis of what happened in China,  what was accomplished-.or not, and  what any of it means for women's equality worldwide.  Speaking of the UN things...a recent  report from the UN's Development Program just confirmed something we've  always known—women continue to trail  men in terms of wages and access to  wealth and resources. The UN report  also estimates that of the 1.3 billion people in the world who are poor, 70 percent  are women.  On that rather sombre note...that's it  this time, As Kinesis goes to press. Hope  you have a great month.  jsys      "*  Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year  'round with memberships and donations.

On September 16, an appeals court  in the UAE convicted Sarah Balabagan  of murdering her employer and sentenced her to death by firing squad. The  appeals court decision reversed an earlier trial verdict that sentenced Balabagan  to prison and ordered her to pay a sum  of money to the family of her employer.  In May 1994, Sarah Balabagan—just  15 years old at the time—left the Philippines to work in the UAE as a domestic  worker. Two months later, she was  charged with the stabbing death of her  employer. Balabagan admitted she had  killed him, but said she had acted in self  defence after her employer had raped  her at knifepoint.  Almost a year after charging  Balabagan with the murder, the Islamic  court came down with its verdict. The  courtacknowledgedBalabaganhadbeen  raped, but still convicted her of killing  her employer. The court sentenced her  to seven years in prison and ordered her  to pay a fine of 150,000 dirhams  (US$40,000) as "blood money" to her  employer's family. His family was also  ordered to pay Balabagan 100,000  dirhams (US27,000) in damages.  In overturning the Islamic court's  verdict, the appeals court rejected the  evidence that she had been sexually assaulted by her employer, and thus her  plea of self defence.  Within a week of the appeals court  verdict, Filipino women's and rights  groups in Vancouver—SIKLAB-BC, the  Philippine Women Centre, and the BC  Committee for Human Rights in the  Philippines—organized a demonstration  in front of the Philippine consulate to  pressure the Philippine government to  call on the president of the United Arab  Emirates to overturn Balabagan's death  sentence. Balabagan has one more level  of appeal that must be decided within 90  days from the handing down of the  appeals court's verdict.  Cecilia Diocson of the Philippine  Women Centre believes the only way  Sarah Balabagan will be released is  through an order from the president of  the UAE. The groups are calling on the  presidents of both countries for  Balabagan's total acquittal, unconditional release and immediate repatriation to the Philippines. If this appeal  fails, Balabagan will be executed.  The death sentence ruling for Sarah  Balabagan comes just six months after  another Filipina domestic worker was  executed. Last March, Flor  Contemplacion was hanged in Singapore for the murder of another Filipina  Demonstration in Vancouver calling for justice for Sarah Balabagan, a 16  year old Filipina domestic worker who has been sentenced to death in the  United Arab Emirates. Photo by Leanne Johnson  domestic worker, Delia Maga, despite  the fact there was new evidence indicating Contemplacion was framed for the  murder, [see Kinesis April 1995].  Despite a massive international outcry and protest by women's and migrant workers' groups calling for a stay  of execution and a full review of the new  evidence, Contemplacion was hanged.  After her execution, Contemplacion's supporters continued to pressure the Philippine government to review her case. President Fidel Ramos,  bowing to protests, ordered an autopsy  be performed on the body of Delia Maga.  The autopsy confirmed that Contemplacion likely did not kill Maga—the  medical examiner suggested it would  have taken someone much stronger than  Contemplacion to have strangled and  bludgeoned Maga to death [see Kinesis  May 1995].  The cases of Sarah Balabagan and  Flor Contemplacion bring into sharp  focus the vulnerability to abuse and exploitation of migrant workers. Since  Contemplacion's execution, women's  and workers' rights organization have  continued to press world governments  to ratify the 1990 United Nations General Assembly Convention for the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers  and members of theirfamilies. Few countries are signatories of the convention—Canada is not among them.  As well, organizers of the Vancouver  demonstration point to the need for bilateral agreements between the sending  and receiving countries to ensure protection of the rights of migrant workers.  Suzanne, a Filipina domestic who  spoke at the demonstration, says the  Philippines must be held accountable  for the safety and well-being of its citizens working abroad. "The Philippine  government didn't do anything to help  Flor Contemplacion. Now we have to  make sure they do something for Sarah  Balabagan and all other migrant workers. We cannot let this happen again."  There are about 6 million Filipinos  working abroad—70 percent of whom  are women—with over 2,500 people leaving the Philippines each day to work as  overseas contract workers (OCWs).  Following the execution of  Contemplacion, the Philippine government brought in the Magna Carta policy  to protect the rightsof OCWs. And in the  Sarah Balabagan's case, Fidel Ramos has  instructed the Philippine embassy in the  UAE to file an appeal on her behalf and  explore all legal diplomatic options to  obtain a favourable ruling.  But Suzanne says she is critical of  the sincerity of the Ramos government  in wanting to safeguard the rights and  well-being of Sarah Balabagan and other  Filipino OCWs. "How come the Philippine government let Sarah go out of the  country? She was only 15, in her second  year of high school, when she was forced  to leave the Philippines to work," says  Suzanne. Suzanne adds that when she  left the Philippines six years ago, there  was a policy that migrant workers had  to be older than 25 years, but now it  seems the policy no longer exists.  Women's and migrant workers'  rights groups say that while international conventions and bilateral agreements, on paper, may appear to afford  migrant workers some protection, they  do not address the root cause of why so  many people from countries in the South  are forced to work as OCWs.  Cecilia Diocson says that  globalization of world economies and  the imposition of Structural Adjustment  Programs on "developing" countries in  the South by industrialized countries  are ensuring there are few jobs that pay  wages to allow people to survive in  countries in the South.  "Global economic restructuring is  forcing people to seek work abroad,"  says Diocson. "We believe the rootcauses  of Filipino people leaving the Philippines to work as OCWs are landlessness,  poverty, and that there is no industry in  our country," says Cecilia Diocson of  the Philippine Women Centre.  Cora, a domestic worker in Vancouver, says the Philippine government  must change its labour export policies,  otherwise the exploitation and abuse of  migrant workers will continue. "The  Labour Export Policy doesn't really work  or help the whole country. Many women  are forced to leave the Philippines, their  families, their children, just because there  arenojobsathome," saysCora. "Unless  the Ramos government changes its labour export policy, there will be many  more Sarahs, many more Flors."  Suzanne says the government of the  Philippines is unwilling to change its  labour export policy because migrant  workers are a valuable source of money  for the government—money that is being used to pay off the country's foreign  debt and not to benefit people in the  Philippines. Filipino migrant workers  contribute US$2 billion each year in remittances back to the Philippine  economy. As well she says, migrant  workers are required to pay US$125 in  order to leave the Philippines to work  abroad. And recently, the Ramos government introduced a new policy to collect another US$25 from migrant workers everytime they renew their overseas  contracts.  The Philippine Women Centre's  Diocson says the solution to prevent the  exploitation and abuse of migrant workers is not going to come through international agreements and conventions.  What is needed is more national industry, and agrarian and land reform in the  Philippines to ensure that Filipinos can  work and survive in their home country  and not be forced to seek work in other  countries.  But in a climate of increasing global  economic restructuring—a climate that  promotes the creation of a cheap, migrant labour force—the situation for migrant workers will likely only worsen.  Organizers of the rally are calling on  as many people as possible to petition  the governments of the Philippines and  the United Arab Emirates for the acquittal, release and repatriation of Sarah  Balabagan. Letters should be sent to: His  Excellency Sheikh Zaid Bin al-Nahayan,  president, United Arab Emirates; and  Fidel Ramos, president, Republic of the  Philippines, Malacanang Palace, Manila,  Philippines.

OCTOBER 1995 News   BC Women's Hospital:  No more formula freebies  by Andrea Imada  Canada's largest obstetrical facility  has become the first Canadian hospital  to refuse corporate handouts from companies selling infant formulas. In mid-  September, the BC Women's Hospital in  Vancouver announced its decision to  begin buying infant formula rather than  accept free or low-cost substitutes for  mother's milk. The decision is one step  in the hospital's program to promote  breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding advocates welcomed  the move, but stressed the importance of  combining the buying decision with  breastfeeding education and training  among health care workers, who are  often the sole information source for  pregnant women and mothers.  "The vision and leadership shown  by the BC Women's Hospital has set an  example for hospitals across Canada,"  said Elizabeth Sterken of Infant Feeding  Action Coalition (INFACT). "Hopefully,  this move will serve as a catalyst for  implementation of policies and practices that will assure infants the best  start in life, and guarantee mothers a  supportive environment to exercise their  choice to breastfeed."  Renee Hefti, a director of the BC  Breastfeeding Society, has campaigned  for years to end the practice of corporate  formula handouts. "This was a very  ethical decision," Hefti said when the  announcement was made. "It's a real  COUNSELLING FOR WOMEN  Susan Dales  Registered Professional Counsellor  FREE INITIAL CONSULTATION  (604) 255-9173  victory for babies and it's a real  victory for mothers who have been  trying to breastfeed."  In addition to offering free  supplies to hospitals, formula  manufacturers have directed promotional and marketing efforts at  health care and maternity workers who advise pregnant women.  Women who switch to infant formula, a practice which often begins in the hospital, eventually  find their milk production will  stop and then they will have no  choice but to continue to use breast  milk substitutes. Studies show that  replacing mother's milk with infant formula results in greater  health risks to the child and  mother. As well, there is the financial cost of buying formula.  Malnutrition, infections,  diarrheal diseasesand reduced immunity in infants are some of the health  impacts associated with the substitution  of formula for mother's milk. Studies  have also found that women who  breastfeed reduce the risk of breast and  ovarian cancer.  Free supplies of commercial formula  in hospitals is only one of several systemic stumbling blocks faced by women  who choose to breastfeed. The World  Alliance for Breastfeeding Action  (WABA) has identified "lack of mater-  WOMEN  IN PRINT  BOOKS & OTHER MEDIA  Discounts for  book clubs  3566 West 4th Avenue  #  Vancouver BC  Special orders  Voice   604 732-4128  welcome  Fax       604 732^129  10-^ Daily ♦  12-5 Sunday  nity leave, inadequate support from family, health workers and employers, inappropriate hospital practices, bad work  conditions, and misinformation from the  infant food industry" as some of the  obstacles faced by women who  breastfeed.  The BC Women's Hospital's decision brings it one step closer to earning  the "Baby-Friendly Hospital" designation sponsored by the World Health  Organization and UNICEF. The joint  VANCOUVER  WOMEN'S  BOOKSTORE  315CAMBIEST.  VANCOUVER, B.C.

The "Baby-Friendly Hospital" designation demands a series of 10 components including training for health care  providers; information, education and  training for pregnant women about  breastfeeding; and policies to encourage  breastfeeding in the hospital and its continued use after women leave the hospital.  In 1990 at the World Summit for  Children, national governments—including Canada—promised action to  help stop the trend towards useof infant  formula and away from breastfeeding.  The Summit also agreed that distribution of free or subsidized infant formulas in maternity units should be ended  by 1995.  Canada continues to lag behind other  countries. Worldwide, over 1,000 hospitals have been designated "Baby-  Friendly Hospitals." As well, an estimated 14,000 hospitals in the South are  changing procedures to support  breastfeeding. And given that BC Women's Hospital is the first hospital to stop  distributing free formula, it is unlikely  that Canada will meet the 1995 target  deadline.  PEN ON FIRE?

IP;;  by Fatima Jaffer  In late August, women from around the  world began to converge on China for the start of  United Nations Non-governmental Organization  (NGO) Women's Forum—August 30th to September 8th—in Huairou, and the 4th World Conference on Women—September 4th to 15th—in  Beijing. The two meetings brought together the  largest number of women ever to discuss women's  rights and organize strategies and actions for achieving women's equality.  In our upcoming two issues—November 1995  and December/January 1996—Kinesis will be  including special supplements with news, interviews, analysis, and commentary highlighting the  events and outcomes of the NGO Forum and world  conference.  Thirty thousand women came to Beijing  and Huairou, China on August 30th, and  over the course of the next 16 days, we  talked, debated, challenged each other, celebrated, complained, laughed and cried,  protested, strategized, workshopped, saw  the local sights and shopped. By September  15th, the historic meeting of the largest gathering of women ever was over and most  women returned to their countries with  "post-Beijing musings" as diverse as the  women who attended.  There are mixed reviews about what  came out of the NGO Forum. The general  feeling is that we won't know what impact  the Forum will have had on women's organizing and movements for social change until  years after Huairou—but that opinion was  not shared by all. Many women felt the  gathering was important in building on the  global networks that began to gel following  the last world conference on women in  Naroibi, Kenya ten years ago. For most  women attending, the NGO Forum offered  a look at what is happening in women's  movements today globally, and gave us an  opportunity to see where the global women's movement is going.  There is also uncertainty as to the final  outcome of the official world conference,  attended primarily by government officials  and some NGO delegates. The main function of the conference was to work on the  Platform for Action—the policy document  outlining priority areas for action towards  the advancement of women's equality. The  Platform discussed at the Beijing conference  is intended to review, update and appraise  Forward LookingStrategies for the Advancement of Women to the Year 2000—the document that was produced at the Nairobi conference.  Not surprisingly, the NGO Forum  proved to be more useful, interesting and  accessible than the official conference. The  conference was often times alienating, frustrating, and not woman-friendly at all. This  opinion was common among other NGO  (and even the governmental) women at the  conference, even for those who were experienced at participating in UN conferences.  The official "UN-speak" used at the  conference and the formal, "malestream"  structure of the UN make it difficult to be  certain about what actually went down at  the conference or how the Platform for Action will be translated by world governments into any real advances for women.  The NGO Forum was by no means perfect—among other things, there were some  logistical problems that had to be worked  out. The Forum site was physically inaccessible to women with disabilities and some  older women. The women with disabilities'  tent and many of their workshops were  located a long way from the central communication and meetingareas. Prompt and concerted protests by international coalitions of  women with disabilities resulted in their  tent being relocated to an area near the core  of the Forum site, special on-site transportation being provided, and other changes  which facilitated the participation of women  with disabilities at a world conference in  unprecedented ways.  Contrary to corporate media reports  globally that participants at the NGO Forum  were so caught in a logistical quagmire, so  awash in mud and besieged by draconian  Chinese security guards that we never got  down to work, women did get a lot done.  Two main things were happeningatthe  Forum: women were in dialogue with each  other—discussing, sharing workshopping  and planning for the future—around the  particular issue areas they work in on a daily  basis; and women were working together to  set the agenda and strategies for influencing  world leaders to ensure the language women  want will be included in the Platform for  Action.  Each day in Huairou began with  plenaries and workshops, and ended with  cultural activities and formal and informal  gatherings and discussions.  Daily plenaries were held on five critical areas of concern: political participation;  globalization of the economy; media, culture and communication; the rise of conservatism in its many forms; and peace,  human security, and the effects of  militarization. Getting work done was hindered by space limitations—plenaries were  held in a hall that could accomodate only  1,500 women, which restricted the ability of  most Forum delegates to participate in these  broader strategizing and planning sessions.  Over 5,000 workshops on the 12 theme  areas, identified by Forum participants, were  held over the course of the ten-day NGO  Forum. These areas covered the economy;  governance and politics; human / lega 1 rights;  peaceand human security;education; health;  environment; spirituality and religion; science and technology; media, arts and culture; race and ethnicity; and youth.  The diversity andnumberof workshops  offered choices and created dilemmas for  women. For example, on the first day, between 9 and 11am, there were 129 workshops offered simultaneously. It was difficult to narrow down which workshop to go  to—many women could find at least 30 they  wanted to attend.  Most of the workshops were overflowing with women from different regions of  the world, so if you didn't get there early,  you'd miss thechance to participate. But that  didn't mean the morning was a total loss...it  then gave you the chance to head over, past  the Global and Youth Tents, to catch the  panel in the Peace Tent on "Peace Reconciliation" by the Sudanese Women's Voice for  Peace.  If you ha d m issed too m uch of the pa nel  talk, you could still go check out the World  Posters exhibitions at the Exhibition Hall.  And if you couldn't decide on where you  wanted to be, you'd miss out on everything.  That happened to everyone at some point.  There were daily on-site demonstrations on a range of issues. Groups of women  demonstrated against nuclear testing by the  French in the Pacific; women marched  against Japan, demanding compensation for  the Japanese Army's use of Korean women  as "comfort women" during World War II;  and every morning, Iranian women now  living in exile performed symbolic stonings  to illustrate political violence againstwomen  by the religious fundamentalist regime in  Iran.  The Women In Black—primarily women  from the Asian region—held a moving, silent tribute to women survivors and victims  of male violence one evening. Canada's National Action Committee on the Status of  Women co-organized a demonstration  against the economic policies of Group of  Seven countries (leading industrialized nations). The demonstration was aimed at the  Structural AdjustmentPrograms in the South  and the dismantling of social systems in the  North, and brought together delegates from  some 60 "first" and "third" world groups.  A couple of times over the Forum's ten  days, women unfurled banners commemorating students killed by Chinese army during a pro-democracy demonstration in  Tienanmen Square in Beijing in 1989. These  commemorations went relatively unchallenged by on-site Chinese security agents.  Protests against China's occupation of Tibet  did provoke some response by Chinese security, but there were no serious repercussions against protesters in the short run.  One of the largest demonstrations on  site was the Lesbian Visibility March on  September 5th. Thousands of lesbians and  lesbian-positive women from every region  of the world marched over every inch of the  site, provoking displays of support or derision from others at the Forum. Indeed over  the course of the ten days, the Lesbian tent—  despite being located in a peripheral part of  the site—attracted a disproportionate  amount of attention from both media and  Forum participants, which tent organizers  saw as successful consciousness raising and  a tribute to lesbian organizing at the Forum.  Probably, the greatest success of the  NGO Forum was the depth and breadth of  the challenge to the rise of conservatism  globally in its many forms—religious, na  tionalist, racial/ethnic and homophobic;  particularly religious and homophobic conservatism.  Muslim women were the most vocal in  their challenge of various forms of violence  against women in the name of religion in  Islamic countries. Among the protesters,  there was a surprisingly large number of  women who openly reject religion altogether  and who are oganizing both within and  outside of Islamic countries against Islamic  fundamentalism and its abuses against  women. These women demonstrated publicly despite the risks to their own personal  safety.  There was also a strong presence of  Christian fundamentalists on site—for example, the anti-choice propaganda film The  Silent Scream played hourly at one venue  every day of the Forum. However, the challenge to them by Western anti-fundamentalist activists was not as visible nor as strong as  the anti-Islamic fundamentalist protests.  There was also surprising silence from anti-  fundamentalism activists from India on the  rise of and response to religious fundamentalism in India.  In light of the amount of activity and  work at the Forum, it was interesting to see  the amazing disparity in the kind of media  weweregettingintemationally.Thefocusof  corporate media reports on logistical problems at the Forum site were baffling. We  heard that delegates awash in rain and mud,  were being hounded by security guards at  the Forum; were under constant surveillance by Chinese secret service agents; were  forced to use unsanitary toilets; lacked adequate food, shelter and transportation...  There was mud and rain, but the toilets  were clean and the food—which one had to  line up for—ranged from good to bad. In  fact, the logistical problems were no more  than to be expected of a gathering of tens of  thousands of women focussed on changing  the status quo in a country which, like most  others, is averse to tolerating alternate views  on social, economic and political matters.  Somewomendid express regret, saying  how completely ignorant they felt about  what was going on in the other parts of the  Forum site or in other issue areas because of  the enormous number of things happening  at the same time and because they were  concentrating on their particular issue area  all the time and workshopping with the  same women.  But overall, there was lots that was positive that happened at the NGO Forum, in-  cludinganenormousamount of organizing.  Women filled workshop spaces, celebrated  victories with each other, shared stories of  experiences since the Nairobi conference,  and much more.

OCTOBER 1995 News   Women's monument update:  Marker of change: women's  monument project underway  by Kinesis Writer  The building of a granite monument  in Vancouver to serve as a reminder of  male violence against women is a few  steps closer to becoming a reality.  In September, the Women's Monument Project (WMP) received a major  contribution in the form of over 70 tons  of Laurentian pink granite—the amount  needed to construct the monument. The  granite was donated by the Rock of Ages  granite quarry in Beebe, Quebec.  As well, the Vancouver Parks Board  gaveapproval to thedesign of the monument, clearing the way for the monument to be built in Thornton Park. Construction of the monument is expected  to begin next summer.  Called "Marker of Change," the  monument will serve as a permanent  memorial to the 14 women murdered at  Montreal's L'Ecole Polytechnique on  December 6, 1989 by an anti-feminist  man. The monument will also be dedicated to all women who are victims of  male violence.  The Women's Monument Project  was initiated 5 years ago by a collective  of women. Christine McDowell, one of  the original members of the collective,  says that the murders in Montreal  shocked many women as to the extent of  male violence against women.  "I was so afraid after the 14 women  were massacred, and it really opened  my eyes to the murdering of women and  to the fact that men were getting more  violent," says McDowell. The collective  came up with the idea of creating a  monument after realizing that there were  no permanent markers remembering the  lives of women who have been kil led by  men.  "Marker of Change"—designed by  Beth Alber—will consist of 14 benches  made of pink granite arranged in a 300  foot circle. The inner side of each bench  will bear the name of each of the 14  women killed at L'Ecole Polytechnique.  The top surface of each bench will have  a slight indentation or reservoir where  rainwater will gather in a symbolic pool  of tears or memory. And the names of  thousands of donors will be inscribed in  the clay paving brick which will surround the granite forms.  Alber, a Toronto silversmith and  artist, was chosen through a national  competition to design the monument.  She says that pink granite from Quebec  was key to the piece, adding that the fact  the quarry which donated the granite is  near Montreal just adds to the significance.  Suzanne Laplante-Edward, whose  daughter Anne-Marie was one of the 14  women killed, adds that the donation  "brings the monument one huge step  closer to reality." She and Alber had  approached Rock of Ages about a donation.  With two-thirds of the required  funding now in place—the total cost is  $390,000—and the final design approval  from the Parks Board, it seems that the  monument project is well on its way is,  indeed, close to becoming a reality. Construction is planned to begin next summer.  Getting there, however, hasnotbeen  an easy road. In 1993, the Women's  Monument Project was bombarded with  a tirade of criticism—by a number of  mostly male, mainstream media columnists—who charged that the monument  was anti-male [see Kinesis, September  1993].  The backlash, which often reached  hysterical proportions, was aimed at the  proposed inscription that will read: "In  memory and in grief/for all the women  murdered by men/for women of all  countries, all classes, all ages, all colours/We, their sisters and brothers/  remember, and work for a better world."  The monument's detractors zeroed in  on the words "for all the women murdered by men," charging that the words  imply that all men are murderers.  Not surprisingly, there were also  attempts to pit women against each other  by distorting and manipulating concerns  and comments about the project made  by women from the women's community and elsewhere.  But Project organizers held firm to  the wording of the dedication, which  was proposed in response to concerns  among some women's groups that the  monument should acknowledge not only  the 14 women killed at L'Ecole  Polytechnique, but all women killed by  men.  McDowell says the Project organizers are pleased that the Park Board took  a stand and accepted the original inscription without forcing any changes.  The Park Board has also made a  commitment to upgrade Thornton Park  to make it more accessible and safe.  Thornton Park is being readied for the  monument's arrival, with new lighting,  pathways and turf expected to be installed as part of an upgrade and restoration project. McDowell says the  changes "will increase the safety of  women in the area, an issue about which  we are deeply concerned."  "The Park Board has taken advantage of a unique opportunity to improve  Thornton Park," Park Board Commissioner Donna Morgan said. "I am very  pleased, especially with the added lighting which will make the park safer for  everyone. And the new pathways and  turf will complement the beauty of the  existing trees."  Although construction of the monument is expected to begin sometime in  1996, work will not start until all funding  has been secured. So far, various  fundraising initiatives have raised abou t  $250,000 of the total $390,000.  The Project has received donations  from over 5,000 individuals, as well as  from Vancouver City Savings, the BC  Ministries of Women's Equality and  Attorney General, Canada Council, BC  Hydro, and Nancy Jackman. SumasClay  in Abbotsford has also committed to  donating the bricks for the circle of donors.  In December, the organizers will be  hosting a Filmathon—Reel Change: Towards a Day Without Violence—from  which they hope to raise another  $100,000.

A message from the Public Service Alliance of Canada   •   (604) 430-5631  OCTOBER 1995 News  Dismantling of social programs in Ontario:  The cuts keep coming  by Kay Ray  In June, when Ontario's Progressive Conservatives, led by Mike Harris,  defeated Bob Rae's beleaguered New  Democratic Party in the provincial election, they did so with a campaign  promising to cut back on government  spending and social programs. The  Conservatives had campaigned on a  platform that employed racist and sexist stereotypes about poor people,  welfare recipients and employment  equity programs. Calling his plan an  effort to restore dignity to Ontarians,  Harris labeled his agenda the "Common Sense Revolution" [see Kinesis  July /Aug 1995].  Now, in the name of 'common  sense,' Ontario residents are witnessing the latest wave of intolerance and  welfare bashing that avoids real discussion about joblessness,  underfunding of training programs,  and lack of jobs in the province.  Within 30 days of taking office,  Harris dismantled employment equity  programs and slashed $2.25 billion  from Ontario's $6.3 billion annual social assistance budget. The cuts systematically attack women, poor people, children and the agencies that service their needs.  Mike Harris would have us believe these are tough choices in a province that will become a "kinder, gentler and fairer" place under his leadership. Ontario residents now are asking the question—kinder and gentler  for whom? Not poor people, not  women, not children, not immigrants  or refugees—all of whom are being  scapegoated for the recession, job loss  and government debt.  It is not surprising that Harris's  first major fiscal move was to announce  massive cuts to social assistance. During his election campaign, the Conservatives played up the image of the  lazy mother who lounges comfortably  on welfare, while having endless numbers of children. Unfortunately, many  voters accepted this as truth.  On October 1st, Harris will cut  social assistance rates across the board  by 21.5 percent. The cuts will apply  not only to individuals collecting General Welfare assistance, but also to all  single parents who receive Family  Benefits.  Marnie Hayes of Neighbourhood  LegalService in Toronto says that these  cuts mean a single parent with a child  under 12, currently receiving $1,221  per month, will only get $957.00—a  loss of more than $250. In a city, such  as Toronto, where downtown rents  average about $750 per month, a single parent with one child will now  have only about $6.50 per day left over  to pay for food, clothing, transportation and entertainment.  After October 1st, many women  may be forced into making the choice  between paying the rent and eating.  Women and children who depend  on food banks will be turning to them  even earlier in the month, and food  banks and other support agencies  may have to decide who to turn away  if they don't have enough food to  offer.  Recent comments by the minister of community and social services  made it very clear that the Conservative government does not have any  understanding of the root causes of  poverty. In late September, David  Tsubouchi suggested that poor people could manage with the 21 percent cut in social assistance, if they  just shopped wisely by buying  dented cans or food in bulk.  Women will also have no guarantees that the amount they pay for  housing won't skyrocket. The Conservative government is considering  removing rent controls and opening  up housing to the whims of the "free  market." In taking a further swipe at  affordable housing, Mike Harris cancelled a number of social housing  projects—including a 300 unit coop  housing project in Toronto that was  already midway through completion.  For single mothers, childcare may  become even less accessible. Those  who work in daycares say they expect Harris to announce funding cuts  to licensed daycares in his next  budget, which will result in a reduction in the number of licensed daycare  spots and a limitation on daycare  subsidies available.  Service agencies will also be facing the dichotomy of handling an  increase in demand for their services, while at the same time bracing  themselves for deeps cuts in provincial funding. The Harris government  is proposing cuts to community service organizations to the tune of five  to 25 percent. Given that many organizations receive matching funds  from federal sources, the total loss  could amount to double Harris' proposed cuts.  Harris also delivered a blow to  social equality in Ontario with the  immediate dismantling of the province's employment equity law. The  legislation, implemented under the  NDP government, required private  companies with more than 50 employees to establish hiring quotas.  The demise of Ontario's employment equity was welcomed by some  disgruntled voters who bought into  the sexist and racist stereotypes employed by the Conservatives which  suggests that employment equity allows unfit and under-qualified peo  ple—namely, people of colour, First  Nations people, people with disabilities and women—to be favoured over  more qualified white men.  The Harris' government returned  to defining employment equity as  "equal opportunity" for all people—a  definition that does not take into account the historical, systemic and ongoing discrimination against certain  communities of people. The small  number of gains made by women,  people with disabilities, Aboriginal  people and people of colour during  the NDP's time in office will soon be  eroded.  In another move that further undermines the work prospects for poor  people in the province, Harris cancelled JobsOntario—an employment  training program for people on social  assistance. And with the proposed  workfare for people receiving social  assistance—otherwise they willbecut  off—it also appears Harris is intent  on creating a pool of low-wage labour.  In human terms, the effect of all  Harris' cuts to social and employment programs—and there are more  to come—is devastating and those  who bear the burden of these cuts are  a disproportionate number of women  and children.  In late September, Harris kept one  of his campaign promises by announcing cuts in provincial taxes. The tax  cut is based on a percentage decrease,  so Ontarians with higher incomes will  benefit more than those with lower  incomes. Even though Ontarians will  be able to keep more of their income,  the question that needs to be answered  is: what will these tax savings amount  to if people are faced with user fees in  the health care system, a jump in rents,  the possible loss of daycare spaces  and subsidies? There are also rumours  that Harris will bring in user fees for  library services as well as parks. Given  all the cuts to social assistance, the  increased cost to individuals for services following cutbacks in government  funding, the proposed introduction  of user fees, and so on...whether or  not the tax cuts will result in any real  savings—except for wealthier  people—is unclear.  Women's and anti-poverty  groups and social service agencies in  Ontario are doing more than just bracing themselves for increased  caseloads,evictions and hunger when  the cuts come in October. Forging  coalition between women's, anti-poverty, progressive goups and unions to  challenge the Harris government has  been an ongoing effort.  To lead the fight back against the  Conservative government's budget  cuts targetting women, immigrants  and poor people, a coalition of groups  formed the Embarrass Harris Campaign. The coalition of more than 30  women's, anti-poverty, progressive  and labour groups—including  Women Working with Immigrant  Women, Ontario Coalition of Rape  Crisis Centres, the Toronto Coalition  Against Racism (TCAR), the Toronto  Direct Action Committee (TDAC) and  the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP)—has been organizing  actions since the first in a series of cuts  were announced in July.  The Embarrass Harris Campaign  has so far organized a demonstration  outside of Queen's Park—the home  of the provincial legislature—on the  day the Harris government was sworn  into office, and is continuing to  strategize and mobilize people—including members of the opposition  parties—to oppose Harris' plans to  dismantle social services and programs in Ontario.  As Harris is preparing to release  his government's first mini-budget,  women and poor people in Ontario  are expecting another round of cuts  that will further undermine their survival and economic well-being. With  Mike Harris' war on poor people  rather than on poverty, community  organizers face one of their greatest  challenges.  As Kinesis goes to press, the Ontario  legislature opens for another session and  the Embarass Harris Campaign is planning to march on Queen's Park to protest  the Conservative government's regressive social policies and budget cuts.

Canada went to Beijing for the 4th World Conference on Women to present itself as a leader in the fight  for women's rights. In Beijing, the Canadian government delegation—led by secretary of state for the  Status of Women, Sheila Finestone—was touted as an  key instigator for pressing other national governments  to adopt the Platform for Action—the document out-  liningpriorityareastowardsadvancingwomen'sequal-  ity.  Feminist activists in Canada say the federal government is being contradictory by claiming to be a  global leader in the advancement of women's equality,  while in the meantime cutting back heavily on social  programs—these cutbacks do little to support women's equality and, in fact, undermine the status of  women.  According to the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC), the situation for women  in Canada has not improved over the last  decade,—since the last World Conference on Women  in Nairobi, Kenya—rather it has regressed. In its summary report prepared for the Beijing conference—A  Decade of Deterioration in the Status of Women in  Canada—NAC highlights areas in which women have  lost ground in the struggle for equality and social  justice. The report was released on September 6th—the  International Day of Action for Women's Equality—in  Beijing by NAC president Sunera Thobani and at press  conferences in several cities across Canada.  Cenen Bagon, NAC's BC Regional chair, spoke at  the press conference held in Vancouver on the situation  for women in Canada and NAC's work in mobilizing  women to stop the dismantling of Canada's social  safety net and resist the attack on women's rights. Here  is an excerpt from her speech:  "We are greatly alarmed by the erosion of the gains  women have made in Canada on the issue of equality.  In 1970, United Nations ranked Canada was ranked  second when the status of women was taken into  account in the United Nations Human Development  Report. In 1995, Canada is ranked number nine.  "When women's wages are compared to men's  Canada ranks 47th out of 55. Where women make up  60 percent of all minimum wage earners, the value of  the minimum wage decreased by 48 percent between  1976 and 1992.  "Inthemidstofincreasingviolenceagainstwomen,  our federal government refuses to fund women's centres and sexual assault centres. Those centres which  receive government funds continually face cuts every  federal budget announcement.  "Under the proposed Canada Health and Social  Transfer (CHST), transfer payments from the federal  government to the provinces will be cut drastically  which will mean "further erosion of our medicare,  education and social service programs—programs  which can only barely meet the current needs of most  women and their families.  "And there are shocking statistics of how many  women and children live in poverty, especially women  with disabilities. Currently, 60.6 percent of all families  living in poverty are headed by single mothers, and one  million children live in poverty; 80 percent of women  with disabilities earned $10,000 or less in 1994 with  almost 60 percent of these women reporting no income  at all.  "The Canadian government regresses also in its  immigration policies, especially in its imposition of  $975 head tax, the proposed sponsorship bond of  $10,000, the proposed user's fees for settlement services, and the domestic workers' continuing vulnerability to exploitation due to the requirements of the Live-  in Caregiver Program.  "In this climate of conservatism in Canada, racism  and sexism are on the rise. And in this climate where  our government fully embraces the dictates of the  multinational corporations and the international financial institutions, the government's status of women  report card rates a total failure—especially so, when  the corporate agenda has become the 'national' interest  and women's equality a 'special' interest."

The  International Day of Action for Women's Equality marked the culmination of the 180 Days/180  Ways Campaign, which began on March 8th—International Women's Day—and which called for a  180 degree reversal of the regressive trends that threaten progress towards women's equality [see  Kinesis Sept 1995].  In Canada, women from Newfoundland to British Columbia took part in the Day of Action  with protests, ceremonies, street theatre, media events, and a Women's Tent City (in Toronto),  among other events. And thousands of women rallied and marched through the streets in more  than 50 cities and towns across the country to Take Back the Night and protest violence against  women. Vancouver's Take Back the Night [pictured above] drew more than 1,200 women out onto  the Streets.

Health information for  disabled women  The Vocational and Rehabilitation Research Institute, based i nCalgary, has sponsored the production of three pamphlets  on health issues, by and for women with  disabilities. Publication of the pamphlets  was supported, in part, with funding from  the Canadian Research Institute for the  Advancement of Women, and Alberta's  Department of Family and Social Services.  The idea for the pamphlets came from  women getting together and relating their  experiences with the health care system.  Often this system treats women insensitively or abusively, providing inadequate  care.  Three pamphlets have been produced,  in easy-to-read language, to help women  access the health care they need. One pamphlet covers general information about  health care, such as how to choose a doctor,  what to expect during an annual examination, and what questions to ask about  medications.  Another pamphlet focuses on sexuality and women with disabilities, including information on pregnancy, birth control, STD's, lesbian sex, masturbation, self-  esteem and abuse. Phone numbers of resources are also included.  The third pamphlet deals with the  issues addressed in the other pamphlets  but is written for health care providers.  The pamphlet covers issues such as physical barriers, communication, privacy and  abuse.  The pamphlets are available on  audiotape, and a limited number of  audiotapes are available on short-term  loan from the institute's resource centre,  with borrowers asked only to pay for any  necessary postage. The pamplets are also  available on formatted WordPerfect diskette for the use of women in other locations, so that relevant local information  may be inserted. Both audiotape and diskette can be purchased at cost.  For more information, or to be sent  pamphlets or to purchase diskettes or  audiotapes contact: Janet Pringle, The  Vocational and Rehabilitation Research  Institute, Research Department, 3304-33rd  St. NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2L 2A6; telephone: (403) 284-1121; fax: (403) 289-  6427.  Free legal advice for  women  University of British Columbia law  students are offering free legal advice to  women who cannot afford a lawyer. The  Law Students Legal Advice Program  (LSLAP)will hold twenty-two neighbourhood clinics throughout the Lower Mainland, including two specialized clinics  for women. LSLAPalso offers specialized  clinics for seniors, First Nations people,  Persons with AIDS, and Cantonese and  Korean speaking people.  The clinics for women have been established to enable women to get legal  advice in an environment that is sensitive  to the barriers women face when dealing  with the legal system.  At the clinics women can receive advice on a wide variety of issues including  welfare, UIC and criminal injury appeals,  small claims matters, workers' compensation, wills, landlord-tenant disputes,  employer-employee relations, and simple criminal charges. LSLAP also offers a  Do-Your-Own-Divorce program which  provides a low-cost alternative for those  seeking uncontested divorces.

Reproductive  technologies  resource guide  Uncommon Knowledge: A Critical Guide  to Contraception and ReproductiveTechnolo-  gies is now available from Women's  Health Interaction and InterPares.  The booklet is a set of "fact sheets"  describing reproductive technologiesand  methods that either inhibit or promote  fertility. The technologies are discussed  ina feminist frameworkand use theexpe-  riences of women both in the South and  the North. The guide emphasizes the potential for abuse of these technologies, especially for population control.  Some of the technologies discussed  are those controlled by the individual  woman such as fertility awareness, the pil 1  and breast feeding as birth control. Also  analyzed are the methods controlled by  the health provider, for example, sterilization, Depo Provera, Norplant and IUD's.  The booklet also looks at the technologies  currently under development, the anti-  pregnancy "vaccine" and RU486XPG. The  guide is $10 or $8 for orders of ten or more  copies.  Also available from InterPares is In  The Name of Development: Exploring Population, Poverty and Development. Thisbooklet  examines the question of whether population control is a development or anti-poverty strategy. The booklet is $6 or $4.50  each for bulk order over 10 copies.

Women's movement  archives in Victoria  Victoria feminists have started up an  archive of the women's movement in Victoria, BritishColumbia. The Victoria Women's Movement Archives is a joint project  of the University of Victoria Library, the  Department of Women's Studies and the  grass-roots activist community. The Archives is housed in the library of the University of Victoria and was officially  opened on September 21.  The Archives feature recordsof groups  active in Victoria since the early 1970's  period of Second Wave feminist organizing. Some of these groups still function;  others have ceased operating. All are part  of a rich legacy of feminist activism which  serves all women in the Victoria area. The  Archives have released documents relating to many of these groups, herstories  which had been left languishing in the  attics and basements of the homes of Victoria feminists.  The Archives not only provide secure  and accessible records for scholars and  activists, but will also, more importantly,  give women a sense of a wider historical  context and pride in the work that has  taken place in Victoria.  The idea for the Victoria Women's  Movement Archives came out of conversations between Susan Moger, a long-time  activist and feminist researcher, and  Deborah Yaffe, a women's studies professor at the University of Victoria with roots  in the feminist activist community. A  number of other women involved with the  university's library, the women's studies  department, and the local feminist community, were active in maki ng the archive  project come together.  Anyone interested in the process of  setting up a similar archive in their own  community is encouraged to contact  Deborah Yaffe at (604)721-6261 (fax:  (604)721-7210; email: dyaffe@sol.uvic.ca)  or Jane Turner at (604)721-8258 (email:  jturner@uvm.uvic.ca). Anyone in the  greater Victoria area who thinksshe might  have suitable material for the Archives  should also contact Jane Turner.  Although the Archives are partially  funded through the university, donations  are still needed to cover some administrative and advertising costs. Anyone able to  donate should send cheques, made out to  the University of Victoria, to Deborah  Yaffe, Department of Women's Studies,  University of Victoria, POBox3043, Victoria, BC, VSW 3P4. Donations in the amount  of $25 or over will receive a tax receipt.  Neighbourhood quilt  project  The Kensington Community Centre,  in south-east Vancouver is putting together  a community quilt this fall. Caffyn Kelley,  a local fabric artist and feminist, and the  present Artist-in-Residence at the centre,  will be coordinating the production of a  huge community quiltcelebrating the lives  of people from the Kensington area.  "There is room for everyone who  wants to get involved in the quilt project;"  says Kelley. She is encouraging people to  make fabric squares for the quilt or to  contribute photos of people in the neighbourhood or interviews with residents.  The deadline for contributing a panel to  the quilt is November 12th.  Workshops will also be held for those  interested in exploring various techniques  for telling stories in fabric. Everyone is  welcome, no matter what your age, stage,  or skill level, and no workshop costs more  than 54.  Anyone interested in participating in  theCommunity Quilt project should drop  in or call the Centre. Open houses will be  held on Sundays from October 1 to November 12th, 2-4pm at the centre.  For further information on the Quilt  project, please contact Caffyn Kelley at the  Kensington Community Centre, 5175  Dumfries Street at 37th Avenue, Vancouver, (just east of Knight Road), or at (604)  327-9401.  Canadian AIDS  Awareness Week  This year's AIDS Awareness campaign, coordinated by the Canadian AIDS  Society, is aimed at addressing the issue of  homophobia and AIDS. AIDS Awareness  Week runs this year from October 2 to 8.  The Society says it chose the theme  because homophobia remains one of the  biggest obstacles to an effective, compassionate response to AIDS in Canada.  Homophobiaand AIDS areso firmly linked  in the minds of many Canadians that their  response to a person with AIDS is often  inseparable to their response to homosexuality.  The Canadian AIDS Society isencour-  aging individuals and organizations to  participate in the annual AIDS Awareness  Week by taking action to fight against  homophobia and ignorance about AIDS,  and to create a better atmosphere of acceptance and understanding for persons  with AIDS.  OCTOBER 1995 What's News  by Shannon e. Ash  Ontario opposes  lesbian spousal rights  The new Ontario Conservative government is now acting against lesbian partnership rights, reversing earlier action by  the former NDP government. In a civil  case currently before the Ontario Court's  General Division, the Ontariogovernment,  acting as an intervenor, is arguing against  changing the definition of spouse in the  Family Law Act. In 1994, then NDP government Attorney General Marion Boyd,  had fought to have the definition changed  to include same-sex couples. However,  she was unsuccessful.  The current case involves two women  who had been in a ten year relationship,  until one woman locked the other out of  the house and business they had established together. The lawyer for the locked-  out woman asked that "two persons" replace "a man and a woman" in the Family  Law Act's definition of spouse. This would  make the Act's support provisions apply  to any couples—same or opposite  sex—that had co-habited at least three  years.  The government's lawyer Robert  Charney, along with the defendant's lawyer, is asking that the claim for support be  dismissed. Charney says that, the support  rules were intended to benefit women in  heterosexual relationships who are financially dependent on their husbands and  not same sex couples. In restricting the  definition of spouse to exclude lesbians  and gay men, the assumption is that there  is less likelihood of a financially dependent spouse in a same-sex relationship. In  supporting the government's position,  Charney referred to the decision by the  Supreme Court of Canada in May that  supported the exclusion of a gay male  couple from receiving Old Age Security  spousal benefits ]see Kinesis July/August  1995].  The government's lawyer contends  that it is not necessary to change the definition of spousebecause a judgecould still  remedy a dispute between lesbian and gay  partners under the current fami ly law system. Charney says a judge, after establishing "unjust enrichment" of one of the lesbian or gay partners, could order that person to pay financial remedies or support  to the other person.  Judge returns gun to  abusive man  A North Vancouver judge changed a  probation order for a Whistler man convicted of assaulting his wife, allowing him  to get back one of his firearms held by the  RCMP. When the man was arrested in  November 1994 for assaulting his wife,  police seized 14 firearms from his home.  He plead guilty and was given a one-  year probation term. One condition of his  probation was that he was not to possess  firearms. But when the man applied to  have one rifle returned for hunting, his  request was approved by Judge Walker of  the Squamish provincial court, despite  opposition from the RCMP.  The man's estranged wife and her  daughter (the father is alleged to have  assaulted her as well) had already moved  out of the area, fearing for their safety.  They have been notified of this latest development.  The ruling sends a negative message  to women who are assaulted by their husbands and male partners. Corporal David  Little of the RCMP, says the ruling may  deter more women from pressing charges  for assault. "Here we are, trying to convince these women to come in and testify,  that they don't have to take the crap that  they've been taking. We want them to feel  safe, but how can they? Women have every  right to be upset about this."  Cuts to immigration  staffing  Workers with Canada's Immigration  Department are bracing themselves for  massive job losses. The department has  announced that almost 1100 full-time staff  members will be laid off as the federal  government shifts to a greater reliance on  computer technology. Most of the  cuts—over 800—will come from application-processing units, but there will also  be cuts at regional and national headquarters. The department currently employs  4500 people.  Centralized offices will process routine applications by mail, despite the fact  there has been criticism of a current centralized office in Alberta.  Use of centralized and computerized  services means that applicants themselves  will be required to do more work in gathering and preparing documents for a visa.

Immigration officials  say the move will save the department $54  million from its annual budget—the department's total budget is almost $600  million.  The poor get poorer  According to a poll conducted in August, 52 per cent of Canadians say they  have been finding it harder to make ends  meet—up from 38 per cent in a 1989 poll.  Nearly two-thirds of households withpre-  tax incomesbelow $30,000 are feeling more  financial pressure, while only 42 percent  of families with incomes of $60,000 or  more said they were finding times more  difficult.  Other national statistics have indicated  that the incomes of poorer families have  taken the sharpest dive. The median income of families fell 2.9 percent after inflation between 1992 and 1993. Even worse  off were single parent families—90 percent of which are headed by women. Single moms saw their family income drop,  taking into account inflation, by 8.6 percent over that period.  It won't be getting any better for single mothers and poorer families, as the  federal and provincial governments' slashing of social programs will surely drive  down their family income levels even  more.  World Bank counts  (live) trees  The World Bank now admits that GDP  (Gross Domestic Product) is "grossly inadequate" as a measure of the wealth of a  nation, because it fails to take into account  the long-term sustainability of a country's  economy and future potential.  When using the measure of GDP, Canadians rank 16th in the world with an  average per capita income of $20,670US.  But under the new system of  calculation—which takes into account  natural and human resources [the earth  and people] as assets which need to be  maintained and "developed,"—the wealth  of each Canadian jumps to over  $704,000US.  Ironically, at a time when the federal  and provincial governments are cutting  programs to support development of people, some economists are saying that the  "new wealth calculations confirm that a  country's human assets are the only guarantee of its future well-being."  Under the old system these resources  were not counted except as products. For  example, unharvested forests [live trees and  ecosystems] were not counted, whereas harvested forests [dead trees] were. Cutting  trees would "depreciate assets", unless the  profitsareused toimprovehurnanresources  [give people education and health services].  The factors used to calculate GDP actually  account for less than 20 percent of real overall wealth.  The question now is, when will women  see our fair share of this nation's wealth.  Kitchen Table Press  ransacked  New York-based Kitchen Table:  Women of Colour Press is trying to recoup  its losses in the face of robbery and vandalism at its Brooklyn offices. Staff at the  progressive publishing house arrived one  morning in late July to find the office ransacked. Among the items stolen were computers, a printer, fax machine, typewriter,  telephones, television and a refrigerator.  "It's really devastating," said Andrea  Lockett, publisher for the 14-year-old  press. The thieves had ripped through  padlocks, doors and locks to gain access to  the press offices.  Kitchen Table is known in the women's community for publishing books such  as This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by  Radical Women of Color; 1 Am Your Sister:  Black Women Organizing Across Sexualities;  Cuentos: Stories by Latinas; and The Third  Wave: Feminist Perspectives on Racism.  The publishing house is hoping to  raise over $8,000, and is seeking in-kind  donations of equipment and office supplies, in order to keep the press operating.

Under this new bill, the  Canada Assistance Plan—which guarantees Canadians the right to social services and welfare,  among other things—will be eliminated. These  changes will have a profound impact on poor  people and working class communities throughout Canada.  Nowhere in BC will these changes have more  of an impact than among the women residing in  the community of the Downtown Eastside in  Vancouver—an area largely concentrated around  Main and Hastings streets. In terms of per capita  income, the Downtown Eastside is the poorest  community in Canada. Although a predominantly male population, women make up 27% of  the residents (1991 Census).  i The majority of women in the Downtown  Eastside live well below the poverty line and are  largely dependent on social assistance. The  Downtown Eastside Women's Centre says that a  1989 survey of sixty women living in the Downtown Eastside indicated that the source of income in 92% of instances  recorded, was income assistance in the form of  GAIN or GAIN for Handicapped.  Multiplicity of issues  have been and are the  cause and effect of extreme  poverty for these women.  The issues most widely articulated by the women are  continuous lack of employment; inadequate housing  and homelessness; addictions and other health  problems; violence  and  abuse; child apprehension; and mistreatment by  the ministry of social services and its staff. First  Nations women and women of colour—who  make up a smaller percentage of the population,  albeit a highly visible one—also face racism  daily from social services, the police, landlords,  as well as other residents.  Many women say they fear the worst once  this new social policy comes into effect. The  current monthly income received from social  services does not adequately provide for basic  needs.  Women are expected to survive on only $542  (approx) for a single person or $975 (approx) for  a single parent with one child per month, a  grossly inadequate amount. Basic necessities  such as reading materials, music, phones, bus  tickets or movies are a luxury.  As stated earlier, one of the major issues for  women in the community is lack of affordable  housing. With few options available in housing,  most of the women have had to resort to living  in the so called hotels, which are single room  dwellings with communal washrooms. Most of  these hotels lack basic amenities such as a stove,  fridge or proper bedding. Security is also a  major problem because doors leading to suites  and washrooms are constantly broken and left  unmended for long periods at a time. Many of  the women complained of lack of safety for  themselves and their belongings.  Alternative housing such as Co-ops is not  being seriously addressed by the three levels of  government. The Downtown Eastside Residents  Association (DERA), an agency focusing on housing issues in the area, has been actively lobbying  for affordable housing co-ops in the neighbourhood. Bridge Housing Society, another agency  also focusing on that issue, is planning to build  a housing co-op for women, but this will only  make a small dent in the amount of housing  needed.  According to a report written by the Women's Centre, "As of March of 1992, DERA had  3,984 applications on their active list" for affordable housing. Meanwhile, the city of Vancouver  has approved development of several condominiums in the area. Marion Dubick, a worker at  the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre, says  "these condos being developed are not for poor  people... these developers have no interest in  building affordable  housing, they're more  interested in making  money. The government doesn't seem to  care. Housing is a nightmare in this community."  Activists and agencies working within the  community forsee disastrous results when  Bill C-76 comes into effect. Eliminating basic  economic human rights guaranteed under  the Canada Assistance Plan such as:  . the right to income when in need;  . the right to an amount of income that takes  into account budgetary requirements;  . the right to appeal decisions about welfare  that they think are unfair; and  . the right not to have to work or train for  welfare  will increase the poverty and vulnerability of  people in the Downtown Eastside.  Many women feel the government is playing  into the corporate right-wing agenda of blaming  the deficit and budget problems on social programs and the people who use them, especially  poor people. This has created a climate that is  anti-poor people, anti-working class people, anti-  immigrant...and in this climate things can only  get worse.

The women have offered to share their thoughts,  concerns and personal experiences about living in the Dowtitown Eastside. They touch on a number of issues which  affect women in the community—issues such as housing, unemployment, drug and alchohol addictions, child  apprehension and racism, to name a few. Their stories do not claim to represent an entire picture of the Downtown  Eastside but they offer a perspective that is too often ignored. The women chose to be interviewed separately, rather  than tell their stories as part of a group discussion. In the interest of their privacy and safety, all four women are using  pseudonyms.  Interview with Frances  Dibetle: What are the most important issues for  you?  Frances: Safety. Personal safety. On the street. A  place to stay. A place for women to be especially during  the day. It's not nice to stay in your room all the time.  The women's centre is definitely a good place to come  to for me. When I was first came down here, I didn't  know about the women's centre really and I just kind  of tried to depend on my friends. But they were people  with problems so you couldn't really depend on them.  When I did find out about the women's centre I thought  it was great. You come here and you have a place to  relax and you're out of your hotel room and you get a  break from looking at four walls.  Dibetle: What are some of the problems you personally face daily?  Frances: I have a problem with alchohol and it  seems that I drink sometimes just for the sake of  drinking. I know a lot of other people who drink for the  sake of drinking, just because there's not much else to  do. Walking down the street to Carnegie, you're constantly harrassed by people on drugs. There's people  there who'll take advantage of you if you're drunk and  vulnerable. That happened to me once. It really changed  my attitude about being down here and thinking that  nobody could hurt me...butone slight provocation and  they're on you like that. I basically keep to myself down  here. I talk to the women in the women's centre. It's a  safe place and they have good references and information.  Dibetle: What are your specific concerns as a first  Nation woman?  Frances: I see many Native women who are struggling with their alcohol problem, and it seems like  they've lost the will to even try to save themselves.  They suffer from very low self esteem and a have a  really negative outlook on life. Often it's the attitude.  I've had thatattitude. Sometimes you're thinking about  survival, just getting through the day, so they don't  actually contemplate what their actions are actually  doing. Its a very sad situation. Right now I'm focussing  on building up my self esteem and I'm starting to feel  more positive about things.  Dibetle: How do you think First Nations women  deal with the feeling of hopelessness that seems so  pervasive in the community?  Frances: I think it's got to definitely be that person  wanting to change themselves. There are places for  people to do that. I think there aren't as many detox  places for women as there are for men. I realized this  when I phoned around a couple of places and they said  'men only,' which at the time I thought was kind of a  drag because I was in a real tough situation. I realized  I was drinking a little more than I should, or I wanted  to but the support was not available. That's a problem.  Dibetle: So you are saying services are often unavailable when you need them?  Frances: The detox centres mostly have space for  men. The youth place [at DEYAS] has a good one for  the younger women and men, but for the older women  I don't think that there is anything there.  Dibetle: What has been your experience as a lesbian in the Downtown Eastside?  Frances: Being gay and down on the eastside  doesn't have any revelance. I see a few gay Native  women down here. We've talked to each other but it's  not as much of an issue as being First Nation. People I  associate with are pretty supportive about my sexuality, they don't judge me.  Dibetle: In this community, there are a number of  issues concerning welfare. What has been your experience when dealing with social services?  Frances: There's definitely a lack of respect in the  welfare offices towards people in this neighborhood.  You go into the office for a purpose, to get help, but a  lot of the times the workers just ignore you. They make  you wait for long periods. But I challenge them when  they are being rude that way. I have been on welfare  since last October and I find it deppressing. With  support from friends and the Women's Centre, I've  worked on my resume and I am looking for work. But  in order to get out of that cycle you have to have  support, a comfortable place to sleep, good surroundings. There has to be positive things to encourage  people to change. In terms of the overall situation,  there's a lot of dependency on welfare in this area. You  can see it in people's eyes, they can't wait for the next  cheque day.  Dibetle: Do you have any other concerns you'd  like to discuss?  Frances: Well, the police in this neighbourhood are  a problem. I find that they're really disrespectful especially towards Native women. They look down on us  and they don't take us seriously. I've tried to talk to  cops who are working the 'beat/ but like I said they  don't respect us. They are basically on a power trip.  Dibetle: What kind of changes would you like to  see take place in this community?  Frances: Basically take away the drugs, create a  healthier environment. We also need better housing  instead of these hotels.  Interview with Jennifer  Dibetle: What do you think are the main issues  affecting women in this community?  Jennifer: The main problem around here is housing. The place I am living at right now is filthy, everything is dirty and there are cockroaches everywhere. I  am scared to go out at night because it's not safe.  Dibetle: What are some of the problems you personally face daily?  Jennifer: I am not able to do things I would like to  do because I'm poor. I can't go to places because I have  no money. But I try to exercise, have one good meal a  day and keep my room clean. I go to the Women's  Centre to talk to other women and that helps my day  go easier. Right now my health is not very good. My  doctor is giving me pills that don't even work. I would  like my health to improve so that I can go back to work.  Dibetle: What kind of changes would you like to  see take place in this community?  Jennifer: I think poor people should be allowed to  have more input in the agencies that are supposed to be  for us. The police should be more caring towards us  instead of being abusive.  Interview with Lulu  Dibetle: What are some of your thoughts on living  in the Downtown Eastside?  Lulu: There's a lot of different populations in the  Downtown Eastside, but I'm thinking a lot about the  Native sisters. 300 or 500 years ago, the white man in  Europe came over here and said, "this is all of our stuff,  get out..." and went about to sytematically stamp out  life as the Native people saw it or had known it for all  those thousands and thousands of years. The white  man took the land in order to establish their dominance  in the world—they basically wanted to keep people  where they're at.  Anytime I try to get out of [this oppressive] system,  I am always confronted with being true to myself or  trying to fit into the system. I could become a great  social worker because I'm very caring, but fuck it. Why  should I go into a system that perpetuates oppression?  The oppression of all peoples in the Downtown Eastside  is just a reflection of [what's going on everywhere].  The whole system is built around the breathless,  lifeless dollar—that is what is the king. [And it says  that] anything that is of a life form of any kind needs to  be stamped out and people buy into that. The whole  system keeps people in their place for a reason, and it's  for the almighty fucking dollar. And these major corporations want their money.  I was just thinking of the word fallacy, like phallic.  Fallacy as in untruth. This whole planet is under  patriachy—the male is worshipped unbelievably. It is  to the detriment of women who are life givers.  I am a single parent and I'm thinking it would be  in the best interest of my son to place him in a foster  home so that he can be provided with better material  conditions, a decent meal every day and good role  models which I can't alwaysdo. [But ithas to be]on my  own terms, where I am still active in his life.  of the neighbourhood  It's so stressful—running here and there, no car, no  home, no yard, the noise, all these problems. One time  my son was getting on the bus, and because he's Black,  this old drunken man thought he could hit my son with  his cane. And the police said, "well, the old man was  drunk." But as far as I am concerned, that's racism.  There's people calling native people in this  neighborhood 'wagon-burners,' 'just good for the bottle,' 'they'll always be good for nothing'... That has to  stop.  Dibetle: Tell us about some of the issues and  problems taking place in this neighborhood?  Lulu: Let me just start with several things I know  about the neighbourhood. I know there are building  managers—both in BC housing and private  rentals—who profit from the welfare system. They get  money out of welfare to fix things in the hotel suites,  when they really don't need the money to fix it, they  could fix it themselves. But they take the money and  nothing gets fixed.  I know people have been living on the streets.  Social services is not helping. I know of a woman...her  son was murdered and she wasn't given funeral expenses. And one time, I needed bus tickets to go to a  medical appointment and my son was in daycare at  that time. I got into a lot of trouble with welfare when  I keep on insisting they give me the bus tickets they're  supposed to.  The children are the most vulnerable victims and  there's no one to advocate for them. They're just told  to behave like little robots. That's been my experience.  The system doesn't care about the side effects of sexual  abuse.  Dibetle: One of the more painful issues for women  around here is apprehension of children by the ministry of social services. As a single mother, has this been  an issue for you?  Lulu: For child apprehension, social services has  way too much power. In terms of my experience, they  didn't give out the resources I was asking for. I didn't  get a babysitter, I didn't getany respite. And they knew  this and they watched me slide down. 1 knew that they  were going to take my son away.  What they said was, "We've taken him away  because you need a break and you've interfered in  resources we have given you." That was used against  me. Well, I am the child's advocate, the child's mother  and I am supposed to interfere if I think my son's well  beingisnotbeinglooked after properly. He wasgetdng  stomach aches, headachesand asthma attacks and they  were saying he just wants attention.  This guy [a psychiatrist] was doing a lot of  behavioral stuff on my kid that Idid not agree with. The  worst thing about being poor is the lack of respect  towards you. When I went to trial the other day for my  child apprehension case, I was astonished. We submitted an affidavit that said how my son's father had  abused him and myself. I've been raped. I've been  abused in every shape and form and so has my son, and  still they want to inform the father of the removal of my  son from my home.  They said he has the right to apply for custody  because it's the law. The reason given is that charges  have never been filed against him. Since the crimes  took place in another city in Canada, I've never been  able to afford to fly there and file the charges there. I  have asked social services for a plane ticket but they've  refused to help me. What do they want? Does it take the  blood of my son on the floor for them to believe me?  There is no justice.  Dibetle: You've mentioned quite a number of  issues here, are there any others you'd like to address?  Lulu: Two very fundamental issues are violence and separation. We've been separated  from nature, from the land—we've lost  caring and empathy for each other. We  need more understanding of what the  effects of abuse are. The effects of abuse  are disassociation. You're not yourself  anymore. You become this thing that can  be manipulated, be told exactly where to  sit. At the end of this long lineup with other  people sitting, waiting for the basic necessities of life.  I think decriminalizing drugs would help  in this neighbourhood. A lot of people in this  neigbourhood have been abused by the system  and sometimes by their families too. Another  problem we have around here is the number of  hate mongers and poor bashers who are pushing  their right wing agendas on people. They've got  good resources and they're well organized.  Dibetle: In terms of strategy, how do you mobilize  a community where many of its residents have been  stripped of their dignity and self worth?  Lulu: I think we need to go underground because  the goverment, let's be honest, is being run by corporations and is also downscaling to be more 'efficient'.  Lets take this opportunity to treat each other as human  beings. I'm very good with collecting information and  kowledge and then simplifying it. I think that would be  helpful for the women. Also linking up with each other  as sisters and as brothers because I don't want to  alienate the men in this community who are very  supportive and want to help in constructing a new  world order, better than what we have now.  Maybe what I'm going to do now is concentrate on  my own story. Part of the healing is dealing with one's  own issues. Support from my sisters in this community  is important to me. There are a lot of sisters who are  working hard and being supportive, but they are not  enough. The thing we have in this community is we  have other sisters who—because of their own internalized oppression—are oppressive to other women.  I've had comments said to me like "well, excuse  me, I'm glad your son was apprehended" or "what are  you talking to us about false memory syndrome, what  do 1 care I just want some donations here, some  clothing and some free food," and then they say fuck  you. We need to support each other as sisters. That's  where I get off. If its a dog eat dog world I'm not  interested. What I'm interested in is linking up with  other people who are making the choice of bringing  change in themselves and also having it reflected  around them. Maybe certain people havegiven up, but  1 think we can't give up.  Interview with Susan  Dibetle: What do you think are the main issues  affecting women in this community?  Susan: I think the most important issues are housing and health problems. Most of the women, myself  included, live in one room hotels. The one I live in is the  best one on the strip but the rest are really bad. They  have cochroaches, broken doors, windows and busted  walls. They're basically unsafe places.  Dibetle: What are some of the problems you personally face daily?  Susan: I am trying to stay away from drugs and  I've cut down on my drinking. Trying to keep my  relationship together is really important and making  sure I eat a hot meal at least once a day. You can't really  do a lot of cooking in the hotels because you don't have  a kitchen, just a hot plate. I go to the Women's Centre  for a meal.  As a First Nations woman, we face a lot of problems with the police. A white person gets more respect  from them. I have a friend who was being abused by  her boyfriend. She reported the beatings to the cops but  nothing was done about it until he stabbed her, almost  killed her. It took a stabbing for the cops to deal with  the situation, now they're acting all concerned. I think  that's wrong.  Dibetle: What has been your experience living in  poverty and trying to survive on welfare?  Susan: The money I get from welfare is not enough  to live on. After I pay my rent, I've only got $261 to get  my groceries. Sometimes welfare gives you crisis grants  but it's getting harder to get that. This is one of the  reasons I come to the Women's Centre to eat. Personally, I don't take crap from the welfare workers but I'm  getting a bad rap for that. The workers don't like it if  you challenge them. The worst thing about being so  poor is not being able to do things that you want to do,  like going to the movies or taking trips. You're just  barely surviving from one month to another.  Dibetle: Would you like to comment on the issue  of child apprehension?  Susan: It's happening mostly to the Native women.  I'd rather not talk about it too much, it's a really painful  subject.  Dibetle: What kind of changes would you like to  see take place in this community?  Susan: We need better housing, anything but hotels. I would like to live in a housing co-op, that way I'll  have more options. I could bake, I love baking and I  could have my kids visit me. We need recreation  facilities. Britannia is way up Commercial drive and  Strathcona is not that good. This is why a lot of us hang  out in the bars, there's nowhere to go, especially at  night. I call the bar my living room. I would also like to  see less drug dealers around here. They're always  hustling people and it's especially hard when you're  trying to quit drugs.  They're always i  your face. Feature  Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside:  Fewer resources  for poor women  as told to Dibetle Masemola   Marion Dubickworksasa counsellor at  the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre.  She spoke with Kinesis about the role community organizations and service agencies  play in the lives of women in the Downtoion  Eastside. She also draws attention to the  inadequacyof resources and how cutbacks in  government social spending could undermine those resources even further.  Dibetle: From your perspective as a  community worker, do you think there  are adequate resources to deal with the  issues confronting women in this community?  Marion: No. Look at all the women  that work in the Centre, we're overwhelmed. I can't even get in to ask our  legal advocate a two minute question  never mind the other hundred women  sitting out there who need to talk to her  as well. She goes into her office at 9:30 in  the morning and doesn't resurface until  5 clock. And that's constant, non stop.  We need half a dozen more legal advocates. There's a lot of pressure on existing resources. For instance, since the  shutdown of Riverview hospital [for  mental health patients], we are seeing  more mental health patients coming in  to use the services at the Women's Centre. This is a serious problem since we  don't have any workers trained in men  tal health advocacy. We really don't  have the funding and the resources to  support these women.  Dibetle: It seems that services for  women in this neighbourhood are really  minimal. For instance, the only detox  centre for women, Pender Detox, closed  down recently. What kind of effect is  this having on the women?  Marion: It's really frustrating. You  try and get a woman into a Vancouver  detox and it's next to impossible. I now  have a connection with a recovery house  in Surrey that will take women who  haven't gone through detox. And when  it gets really bad, they'll take them to a  hospital. In Vancouver, women can't get  into a recovery house without first going  through detox, but they're all full. It's  thatbad. And as more and more services  are getting cut-  Women can't even get clothing  vouchers anymore from welfare. A  women comes out of prison, all she's got  on is a pair of shorts, a halter top and a  pair of sandals. This is the end of September. She goes to see her worker and  says, "this is all the clothes I've got on  my back," and the worker says, "here's  a list of all the places that have free  clothes. You can go to the Women's  Centre, you can go to St. James..". That's  all the support she gets. And then she  has to run around looking  for free clothes. Who wants  used underwear? She then  has to return to welfare with  letters from each place she visited stating that she couldn't get clothes  that she needed. The worker then reassess her case and if she is lucky she'll get  a hundred bucks. It's a total joke.  Dibetle: Next year there's going to  be further government cutbacks on social programs. What impact will these  cutbacks have on the women in this  community?  Marion: The number of women coming into the Women's Centre has doubled from last year, and I can see them  more than doubling next year because of  the cutbacks. Where are the women going to go? They're going to come here.  We offer a free meal. Our line-up for  lunch goes out the door now and this is  a long building. We are going to start  running out of food.  Dibetle: How are agencies such as  the Women's Centre going to function  with such minimal support? Do you  have any strategies in place to try to  obtain more funding for instance?  Marion: We're not getting enough  funding as it is. As the government cuts  back, are they going to say..."we're cutting back here, and we're going to give it  to these  people  down here  who are  helping"?  No, they are not. They're going to say  we're cutting back from everybody, but  it's the poor who are going to feel it, not  the rich. We're going to have more and  more people sleeping under bridges.  You go down to Seattle and you see  people all over the place sleeping on the  streets, in cardboard boxes and alleys.  That's what Vancouver is turning into.  Sure, do your cutbacks, build your  condos. Where are the people going?  Dibetle: In what ways can you mobilize people and effect some kind of  change?  Marion: By just staying as visible as  possible. The different organizations  down here are getting more united.  There's more commmunication happening between them. We should be telling  other people about what's going on in  this neigbourhood and what we need.  We should be talking to the media.  Dibetle: Do you have anything else  you want to add?  Marion: Yeah. If anybody wants to  help, give us a call. We could always use  donations. Cash donations.

(Ballantine Books, New York, 1995.)  OCTOBER 1995 Arts  Review of Midi Onodera's film Skin Deep:  Beyond scratching the surface  of engendered bodies  by Laiwan  Produced by Daruma Pictures Inc.  Toronto  Skin Deep is a fictional narrative about an  award-winning filmmaker, a lesbian of Japanese descent, named Alex. Thirty-to-forty-  something, tough, ambitious and egotistic, she  embarks on a new film that her producer describes as "tattoo-woman goes crazy and kills  her lover". Alex, however, wanting a larger  vision for her film, starts researching experiences of tattooing and places an ad in a tattoo  magazine.  Chris works as a mechanic in a small town  garage. He sees the ad and writes to Alex. Alex  is intrigued by Chris' poetic descriptions of the  states of being tattooed and sends him a ticket  to come to the big city for an interview.  From here starts the spiraling complexities of two worlds colliding with obsession,  misunderstanding and miscommunication.  Chris is attracted to Alex. Alex is too busy  and too wrapped up with herself to deal with  it Things become uncomfortable with Chris'  strangely intense presence and the slow realisation that Chris, who had passed as a man, is  actually a woman.  Chris, with unspoken feelings building  up, stalks Alex and invades her personal space.  The film climaxes with Chris proclaiming his  love to Alex and unable to handle the pain and  anguish, he attempts to kill himself uttering "I  just want to be normal!"  With this her first feature film, Midi  Onodera places into question 'What is normal?'  Throughout the film, our expectations and  assumptions are destabilised by various visual  and moral plays.  KeramMalicki-Sanchez,amaleactorplay-  ing Chris who is transgendered with a woman's body; Dana Brooks, a female actress playing Penny, a woman who passes as a man  playing a drag queen; Melanie Nicholls-King  playing Montana, Alex's lover and production  assistant, who is Black and can speak fluent  Japanese, and Natsuko Ohama playing Alex,  who isjapaneseand cannot speak the language  —are examples of how Onodera juggles characters and deftly pits stereotypes against each  other. By doing this she undermines our judgemental and essentialist perceptions that form  our prejudices. At first glance, both Chris and  Penny are definitely not easily identified by  gender; this makes the viewer do a double take  and makes us question our constructed notions of gender.  However, it's not such an easy task to  unravel stereo types. In other instances Onodera  is close to crossing the line to create more  stereotypes. TheimageOnoderacreatesof Alex  is contrary to the demure, submissive, delicate  Asian woman, and is instead the aggressive,  ambitious, erotically charged tiger-lady. It is  uncertain if any stereotype has been dispelled  here. However, I'd rather see a take-charge  Asian lesbian on film than the ever-so-common  images of the studious-dutiful-Asian-daughter or the siutty-bad-girl-behind-the- triad-boss  types.  With the portrayal of Chris, however, the  task was much more complex. There are no  films I know of that have attempted to reflect  the lives and experiences of transgendered peoples, and specifically not stories of 'a man in a  woman's body'. The danger of painting Chris  as unempowered, inarticulate and victim is  countered by the reality that empowerment,  the chance to speak, to be heard and to have a  safe place in society is very rare for marginalised  groups like transgendered people.  Trying to review this film, I realised how  intricate and new these issues were and what  wereOnodera'schallenges.Irealisedtoothatit  raised many complex questions which this review may be too short to analyze, but, I'll tackle  some.  At a very basic level this film makes visible  the misunderstanding of, and the lack of resources available to, the lives of transsexuals  and transgendered peoples. In real life this can  Keram Malicki-Sanchez plays female  to male transgendered Chris.  Photo by Candy Pauker  be seen in the current case of The People of the  State of Colorado vs Slxaron ClarkakaSean O'Neill,  where O'Neill is being tried for sexual assault  and criminal impersonation. His four teenage  complainants are ex-girlfriends who claim they  did not know O'Neill was a girl, and that this  gender deception is tantamount to rape. An-  othercase is that of Teena Brandon aka Brandon  Teena, a 21 year old Nebraskan who was raped  and murdered by two former male friends who  were outraged to find out Brandon had so  convincingly passed himself as a man.  These youths who are struggling with issues of identity and sexuality usually find themselves isolated, out of home and school by mid-  teens and working the streets to get by. Many  do not survive.  At an even more basic level, woven into  the heart of these complexities are misogyny  and homophobia, both in our external social  environment and internalised. In Skin Deep's  climactic scene, when Chris angrily tells Alex  "You like men, REAL men" what is being  implied, in contradiction, is both "I am your  man...you are not a lesbian" and "I am not a  man...am I a lesbian?" Chris' attempt then to  kill himself is in response to the futility of this  Dana Brooks plays a woman playing a  man doing drag, and Natsuko Ohama  plays an award-winning filmmaker,  Alex Koyama, in Midi Onodera's dramatic feature debut Skin Deep.  Photo by Gabor Jurina  dilemma — the concept of what is real  becomes skewed.  For Chris to become empowered he  needs compassion, to be heard, to be seen, to  be real. From the beginning, his attempts to  be who he wants to be is negated by how he  is seen and the realities of his biological  body. Soon after his arrival, Chris and Alex  accidentally bump into a drag queen who  hotly retorts "You should watch where  you're going, Hong Kong!" When Chris  chivalrously steps in, the drag queen bellows "Who do you think you are, baby  dyke? "This brief interchange is loaded wi th  a confusion of boundaries: a drag queen —  a male dressed as a female; Chris—a female  passing as male mistaken as lesbian, and Alex  —a female as female as lesbian loaded with the  stereotype that all Asians are the same...Hong  Kong-Japanese, same dif.  With all of these marginalised identities  taking a mixed-up front stage I'm really wondering What is normal? With Skin Deep's emphasis on the so-called 'abnormal', what I begin  to realise is that which isassumed normal is that  which is dangerous and actually very common.  Alex, the successful filmmaker blinded by ambition, too busy to take care of her relationships  orherself and too high-achieving to notice who  she uses and discards — Alex passes all of this  as normal, and we as audience fall for it, especially if we feel outrage at how Chris is portrayed, which seems to be a point of contention  among audiences.  At the core of Alex's so-called normalaj  and Chris'disempowerment, are issuesof class.  Chris, a mechanic, is invited as a research subject to enter Alex's fast-paced, glamorous world.  How Chris as research subject becomes demoted to a gopher on Alex's production set is  unclear to me. When the production decides  Chris has to go due to his strange intensity and  his intrusion into Alex's space, the producer  says to Chris "I have a friend with a  garage who could use some help" it becomes clear how patronized Chris is in  this world.  Alexisnevertruthful to herself about  her using of others to be successful. In her  egotism, nothing is more important beyond herself. When she and Montana are  breaking up, Montana blames Alex for  her poor communication. Alex retorts  "This(the relationship) isa luxury.Jdon't  have time to communicate."  In the end, Chris in rage and humiliation tells Alex "I trusted you...When 3  look in the mirror all I see isa lie. Someone  I don't even know." Here, many things  are being said. Chris'betrayal is based on  his assumption that Alex had the compassion and insight to really see Chris.  And yet, Chris too did not know how  even he could see his real self. The lie is  true on both accounts—to Alex he is not  who he is, to himself he is not who he  internally is. This trap occured because  there was no basis for understanding, no  models for both Chris and Alex. Chris'  attempts to be seen were unsuccessful  from the beginning, let alone that he was  dealing with an insensitive Alex, and  because of this his reaching out became frantic,  obsessive, desperate acts — a typical, normal  human reaction. What Chris needed to do was  to untangle the web, the seduction of Alex's  normalcy and be on his own terms. This he does,  packing his bags and leaving Alex to ambition  on in this production-valued world.  From images of luscious tattooed bodies  in the opening scene, to the intricate soundtrack of drumming from Chirashi, Vancouver's  Uzume Taiko's first CD, to the rare lesbian of  colourgazeestablished in the firstactwith Alex  and Montana in steamy sex, to the elegant set  design of Alex's studio and to the humorous  choreography of the drag queen acts—Onodera,  even with the struggles of this being an independent, low budget, first feature, has successfully put onto the big screen much to revel in,  contemplate and question oneself about.  This isn't your mainstream-Canadiana,  "family-values" content, nor is it your lesbian  of colour, Asian/Japanese, feminist, love pic  standard. Skin Deep is definitely not a comfortable film — neither in the challenging subject  matter, norintheday-to-dayfilmmakingstrug-  gles that Onodera faced over the last six years  in researching the script, fundraising,  filmmaking or now finding a distributor. It is  always this daring and filmmaking integrity  that makes Onodera's large body of work  unique, troubling, refreshing and controversial, but never Hollywood.  Be warned, Diane Keaton is preparing to  produce her version of the Brandon Teena  story starring Drew Barrymore based on a  homophobic novel by true-crime writer  Aphrodite Jones. Yes, Hollywood knows no  justice, and capitalism knows no boundaries!

Many of us attended the premiere  ivith no information on the film or on xvhy there was  a press ban. But we attended with an excitement  around the mysterious neiv feature from Onodera.  This month's Vancouver International  Film Festival did not accept Skin Deep to be shown  among its screenings because the film had been shown  at Out on Screen. This is unfortunate for both those  who missed it and the missed opportunity for Skin  Deep to be exposed to a wider audience.  Midi Onodera is a Toronto based, Japanese-  Canadianfilmmaker who lias a largebody of respected  work, of primarily experimental films, built consistently over the last decade, lhad the good fortune to talk  with her after a panel during Out on Screen:  Laiwan: What inspired you to make Skin Deep?  Onodera: Well, I began Skin Deep about six years  ago researching and developing the project. It  came out of my previous films specifically Ten  Cents a Dance, Parallax and The Displaced View.  With Ten Cents A Dance, I was trying to focus on  issues of sexuality of that time — 1985. With  Displaced View, I was dealing with racial identity,  if you want to distill it down to that, and specifically, the linksbetween two generations of Japanese Canadian women. What I decided to do  after was try and push those ideas further into  what would be the next logical step. With Skin  Deep, I really felt gender was the first step I  wanted to explore. I think gender is really the  mostbasic component of who we are. When you  walk into a crowd of people the first thing you  notice is whether or not they're male or female,  then you notice if they're short or tall, fat, slim,  good-looking, not good-looking according to  whatyou think. If youcan'tgetpastcategorizing  gender like this, then it can become problematic  in the way that we socialize with each other.  Laiwan: Looking back at your two most recognised films: Ten Cents a Dance is structurally  experimental with controversial subject matter  exploring different sexualities and sexual expression; and The Displaced View is a touching  love letter to the women in your family made in  a documentary style that is also experimental,  pushing the boundaries of language — of what  is translated and what is untranslatable and  what is gestured. What kind of direction have  you taken with Skin Deep?  Onodera: In between Displaced Viexv and Skin  Deep I had written two half hour scripts for  television. I was already dabbling, I suppose, in  that narrative three act structure. Early on with  Skin Deep, I made a very conscious decision to  make it a conventional narrative because I felt  the issues I wanted to cover in the film were very  outside of what usually is represented in the  mainstream. I felt I needed an entry point for my  audience and that entry point, for me, is the  structure of conventional narrative. So, thereare  characters, there is a story, a beginning, middle  and an end. For me, that is part of my experimentation. On one level one can say well, its a  conventional narrative. On another level, I can  personally say it's an experimental film with a  form of narrative that introduces and interjects,  and hopefully, pushes the boundaries of narrative construction.  Laiwan: What do you think are the specific  gender issues you're deal ing with in Skin Deep?  Onodera: What do you mean?  Laiwan: In the film there are issues of abuse,  dysfunction or not being accepted, discrimination, the articulation of transgendered experiences... What were you hoping to bring out  through the exploration orthe representation of  these issues?  Onodera: Certainly I never felt I was representing a positive role model for the transgender  community. That of course is a very loaded issue  to begin with. But I was trying to get across the  kind of pain, the kind of anguish and the kind of  isolation some people, who are transsexuals or  transgendered, feel when they realize, and are  beginning to accept, that perhaps what they  perceive themselves to be on the inside is not what they were bom with.  I think that isa very painful process to  go through. What I was hoping to do  was to put a character out into the  world people would take a second  look at and relate to on a human level  rather than the level of 'these people  are strange, they have nothing to do  with me.' Emotions are human, that  is how we connect with each other.  We have to feel for each other before  we can move on and before there are  clearlinesofcommunicationbetween  us. It's like saying 'spend a day in my  shoes and you'll see.'  Laiwan: What has been the general  response to Skin Deep?  Onodera: If I can say there is a general  response, I would say it has been incredibly  mixedandthefilmhitsalotofnerves.Alotofthe  reactions are incredibly raw and direct. Some  people find tlie issues and the representations in  the film are working against political stniggles  thatarehappeningnow. Other people really feel  it is an important film because it is putting those  issues out, perhaps for the first time in their eyes.  It gives them the opportunity to discuss and  perhaps analyze it further for themselves.  Laiwan: This film has taken you six years to  make. What was that made up of?  Onodera: Itcertainly wasn't spenttwiddling my  thumbs! Six years ago when I was beginning to  form these characters for Skin Deep I spent a lot  of time researching transsexuality. Now the landscape, dialogue and political priorities of that  community have changed over the years, even  the term transgender at that time was not really  a political focal point for identity. It was more  dealing with the issues of transsexuality and  cross dressing. So, it took meat least a year, if not  more, figuring out how I felt about female to  male transsexuality, how I fit in to that kind of  continuum as a lesbian and in relation to female  to male transsexuals. I specifically centred my  research on female to males. I did not deal a lot  with male to females and that was a conscious  choice on my part to narrow the politic. Of  course the script has gone through many revisions and the process of raising money takes up  an enormous amount of time and energy.  Laiwan: There must have been a reason why you  chose 35mm as a film format for Skin Deep  because Displaced Viexv and Ten Cents ADance  werel6mm.Soyou'removingtoalargerformat,  hopefully alargeraudience, and you're wanting  distribution probably in the mainstream.  Onodera: The whole (industry) structure of a  feature narrative is one of distribution. In a  country like Canada with very few distributors,  you have to follow the format of what's out there  in mainstream theatres and that is 35mm projec  tion. In places like artist-run-centres they only  usually have 16mm, super 8mm and video projection.  I want to engage with the mainstream  form but it does not mean that I'm going to limit  myself to features now.  Laiwan: Can you describe some of the difficulties of going onto 35mm?  Onodera: I think thatany lowbudget feature has  inherentproblems. VorSkin Deep, thecashbudget  is still under half a million which is incredibly  small for film. But we did an amazing job with  that money. With a film like Skin Deep it could  never have been done without the efforts of  Onodera, director of Skin  by Candy Pauker  I want to see  characters who are  multi-dimensional,  who are not perfect,  who do other things besides  sleep with whoever.  There are 24 hours in a day...  (But), if I was a financially  ambitious filmmaker,  I would make a  soft lesbian romance.  hundreds and hundreds of people. So, the film  is not only mine, it is also theirs. The problems  are always financially based. There's never  enough money so you always have to find creative ways of getting your vision across. For me,  this was my first dramatic film, so of course it  was my first time working with actors, and with  a huge number of crew members, and that was  a huge challenge for me.  Laiwan: What kind of funders did you find?  Was it difficult to find funders who would  support this kind of subject?  Onodera: I initially went to the arts councils for  support because my other films have received  arts funding from the Canada Council, the Ontario Arts Council and the Toronto Arts Counci 1.  So that was an obvious place to go. I think  because of the arms length policies within those  arts councils, the subject matter was not a problem. What they look at is the progression of my  work, where the new film fitted in and how well  I convinced the jury I could make the film.  We also received money from the Toronto lesbian and gay community. It was a small  amountof money but it was important for me to  have that kind of financial acknowledgement  and support from the Toronto lesbian and gay  community. We also, surprisingly enough, received money from the National Association of  Japanese-Canadians. They have a community  source of funds which is primarily from the  redress settlement around the internment of  Japanese Canadians. So that is community money  and is dispersed through the community. Certainly the proposal for Skin Deep was very different from the usual T would like to take piano  lessons' or T would like to leam Japanese brush  painting' or anything like that It was a wonderful message of support from the NAJC not only  financially but also personally.  We received a lot of support at the end  of the project from the National Film Board  Studio D. And again, Studio D is known as the  women's studio but working primarily indocu-  mentaries, so they were steppingoutside of their  known projects. Skin Deep is a co-production  with the National Film Board. We received money  from Heritage Canada and the Liaison of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto, Racial Equity  fund. These two components were supporting  apprenticeships for people of colour, artists of  colour to work on the film and that was another  key component I had wanted.  Who we did not receive money from  was theOntario Film Development Corporation  and Telefilm Canada.  Laiwan: Whydidn'tTelefilm Canada andOFDC  fund you?  Onodera: Telefilm Canada, which is the federal  agency for supporting film and feature films in  television production, has a guideline that if you  are making a Canadian feature film you must  have a bona fide Canadian distributor attached  to the projectbefore you even walk in their door.  What that means to Canadian filmmakers is that  there are about 5 or 6 distributors in the country  and because Canada is so small it's very difficult  to recoup your costs at the box office. So then  you rely on television sales. The way thecountry  works is, of course, no one ever goes to see  Canadian films so you have an automatic cut off  at the box office. It costs a lot of money to launch  a film theatrically, but more so in Canada because we're so spread out.  I think the strength of Canadian films is  their individual nature and uniqueness. But the  fate of a film is in the hands of the distributors in  termsofwhatgetsmadeandwhatgets screened.  It is not only a dilemma which we faced, but it is  a dilemma which every independent filmmaker  in this country faces trying to make a film that is  outside of the mainstream Canadian model.  We chose to continue to make the film  without distributor support which is why it has  taken this long. The only supportive government money out there are the arts councils and  they are limited especially bec'ausecultural funding is getting cutback all over the place, not only  in BC but across the country.  Laiwan: You would have to have a distributor  approve the script and project?  Onodera: You would have to have a distributor  who was willing to say yes, this project is really  exciting and I can see I'm going to make money,  I'll break even or for whatever personal reasons.  So you go in at the script stage and of course  they have criticisms, they have comments, they  have changes. It's dependent on whether you  are willing to make those changes on everything  from story tocasting to editing. And then Telefilm  wants control as well.  Continued as Midi pg 20  OCTOBER 1995 Arts   Vancouver's Fringe Festival:  A few from the fringe  Vancouver's Fringe Festival was "Alive on the Drive in '95." After ten years of being held in the Mount Pleasant area, festival organizers decided to  shift the festival, held in September, to the Commercial Drive area. Another new feature for the annual theatre festival this year was the outdoor stage in  Grandview Park, featuring clowns, buskers and family free entertainment.  This year about 100 different groups and individuals—from Canada, Britain, the United States and Mexico—provided Vancouver theatregoers with a wide variety  of shows to sample from. By the end of its ten day run, the Fringe had drawn over 58,000 people to its 500 performances. Sfmnnon e. Ash and Leanne Johnson had a chance  to catch a few of the plays written, produced and performed by women, and provide Kinesis readers with their thoughts and reviews.  by Shannon e. Ash  BOADICEA -  THE RED-BELLIED QUEEN  Originated by Foursight Theatre,  in association with Cath Kilcoyne  Foursight Theatre  Wolverhampton, England  It was my ninth-grade Latin teacher  (back when they still taught Latin in  public schools) who first revealed to me,  in dramatic tones, the story of Boadicea,  the Celtic queen who led a rebellion  against the Romans in first-century Britain. Those who have read Anne  Cameron's books know Boadicea is a  favourite heroic figure. In Boadicea - The  Red Bellied Queen, Foursight  Theatre—whose task is to bring historical women to life—takes the legend and  history of Boadicea through a complex,  if not complete, exploration.  Given that little of Boadicea's history is established fact, it is open to a vast  amount of interpretation. In Foursight  Theatre's play, Boadicea's daughters are  fleshed out: Voddiccia (Katharine  Ratcliffe), the eldest, represents revenge  and fierce pride; Voada (Sue Pendlebury)  is compassionate and critical. And the  character of Marius (Simon Thorp), a  Romanized Celt, is introduced.  The beginning of the rebellion is  presented simply: Rome will not accept  the rule of a woman—Queen Boadicea  (Stephanie Jacob) of the Celtic Iceni  tribe—after the death of the Celtic king.  Boadicea refuses to submit her people to  Roman rule. The subsequent flogging of  Boadicea and rape of her daughters is  presented through an intense use of  breath, timing, motion, and text.  The tragic theme is juxtaposed with  humourous "post-traumatic stress"  scenes where dead characters rise and  speak again (not to mention, argue,  shout, and play music.) I found this  humourous aspect almost overwhelming, even confusing at the beginning,  putting the viewer off-balance. Perhaps  that is the intention, given that these  scenes give a critical look at the heroic  legend of Boadicea. Boadicea is called  on by other characters for inaccuracies  in her version of events, such as her  heroic call for rebellion. In reality, she  admits, "we had to be secret."  There is skillful use of movement,  words, song, and music throughout the  play. The songs are stark and powerful,  and great battles are convincingly rep resented with a few people.  The dangers of the warrior path,  even when taken against oppressors, is  the complex theme tackled here. The  songs speak of protecting sacred groves,  Left to right: Susan Helenchilde, Andrea  Rasmussen and AM Rosenhek in Sacraments of  Freedom, at the Vancouver Fringe Festival,  1995. Photo by Heidi Henderson  but also promise spilled blood. As the  rebellion continues, Boadicea prays to  the Goddess to rid her of compassion  and mercy: "Destroy my mother heart."  Voada is frightened by this blood  lust. The magic stone which holds her  mother's cast-off qualities represents  "love" to her, but "weak things" to her  fierce sister, Voddiccia. When Boadicea  decides to torture captured Roman  women and their infants, Voada protests: "They're innocent." Boadicea  counters: "Your sons raped my daughters."  Among the most powerful images  are the funeral procession for the king,  with singing mourners carrying a box  draped in a beautiful Celtic design, and  the interaction/juxtaposition of Boadicea  and Roman General Suetonius (Simon  Thorp), who reflects the smug, superior  faceof imperialism: Boadicea represents  "everything I loathe about the Celts," he  says.  I found the only weak spots to be an  anti-climactic ending and the linking of  Voada's pregnancy (by Roman rape)  with her compassionate feelings—it  smacks of "maternal instinct." As well,  a knowledge of Boadicea's story is a  definite asset, given the complex presentation and lack of program notes.  Boadicea skillfully integrates all aspects of theatre, in a professional, powerful, arresting work.  SACRAMENTS AND  FREEDOM  Written by Susan  Helenchilde  Style of Cause  Vancouver, BC  "In 1935, a woman  had three choices: be a  wife, be a nun, or be  dead." So goes the teaser  for Sacraments and Freedom, which examines  these options through  the characters of three  Irish Catholic sisters living in Depression-era  New Brunswick. The  bulk of the play is a conversation between two  sisters, Norah and  Molly,in the bedroom  they share in their family home. Their drunken  father is heard occasionally in the background,  singing bits of cliche Irish  songs; their mother is  dead, and the third sister, Kelly, is a  cursed topic to Norah.  Norah (Ali Rosenheck) is pious  and plans to be a nun; Molly (Susan  Helenchilde) is worldy-wise and  plans to marry and move to Montreal  with a Protestant boy. She can't get  her own home or a business, she reasons, "so I'll settle for a family." She  chafes at the restrictions on women.  The dialogue is humourous, and  Helenchilde carries the scene well  with dry wit and energy, but  Rosenheck's performance of Norah is  lacklustre and her accent is shaky.  The ghostly appearance of Kelly  (Andrea Rasmussen, in an uneven  performance), her bloodied gown  evidence of her illegal abortion, gives  hope that the play will become more  engaging. The revelation of Kelly's  fate is not predictable, and her death  from a back alley abortion is convincing. Unfortunately, the thread of didacticism running through the play  comes to full flower here, as Kelly's  ghost lectures her sisters on the best  options for them.  Style of Cause's members have  day jobs as (mostly) lawyers.  Helenchilde also wrote and directed  a previous Style of Cause production  and her work here shows potential,  despite Sacraments and Freedom being,  overall, disappointing.  SLAP!  Originated by Naomi Cooke and  Kate Joseph-Hale  Naomi Cooke Productions  Wolverhampton, England  Here's a different, and much more  accomplished, take on three Irish Catholic women. Slap! was first seen in Vancouver as a work in progress at last  January's Women in View festival.  The talented Cooke, formerly of  Foursight Theatre, portrays, in a series  of monologues, an Irish Catholic grandmother, her daughter and granddaughter, living in Northern Ireland. The preparation and cooking of a simple meal  (liver and potatoes) links the three  women: Gracie, the grandmother, begins, and Theresa, the granddaughter,  completes and eats it.  Gracie speaks of her dead husband  with both hate and affection; she lives  within the strictures of her  religion—except for a brief experiment  with birth control pills given her by her  rebellious daughter Shauna, which she  gives up after they increase her sex drive,  not something she desires. She has 13  children, she tells us, and as we watch,  she relives the pain of a miscarriage.  "I'm not afraid of the dark," she says at  Naomi Cooke in Slapi  the beginning of her scene, and in her  voice we hear both stoicism and fear.  Shauna, now a middle-aged mother,  describes her life of assisting women  seeking help with birth control and information, and supporting the Irish Republican Army (IRA). She is cynical and  OCTOBER 1995 Arts  Vancouver's Fringe Festival:  SLAP! continued from previous page  tough, cursing at her mother's ignorance, and disdaining some of the women  she aids. Politics—that is, the Republican political movement—is her driving  passion.  She reminisces of the heated days of  the Troubles, and how her mother's  miscarriage coincided with Bloody Sunday—the oppression other mother and  the Irish people, by the Catholic Church  and the British Army, linked together.  Theresa isa young, energetic woman,  a lesbian...and pregnant, whence comes  the joking reference to "virgin mother."  She bounces around the kitchen as she  tells us how, unlike her mother,  "I wasn't interested in fighting men,  or fucking them."  But she hasnow left Belfast, no place  for a gay person—among other reasons,  the IRA doesn't approve of homosexuality—to live with an old school friend,  whom she met in Belfast's only gay bar.  And we learn thather grandmother,  who knew of her sexuality, left her small  estate to her, so she could escape the  limits of Northern Ireland.  Cooke portrays, in a very human  way—humourous, touching, and complex—what are in effect representatives  of three generations of Northern Irish  women. Both writing and presentation  are superlative.  by Leanne Johnson   FAT GIRLS (WEAR ALL SIZES)  Written by Kelly Jo Burke  Invisible Actors Inc.  Vancouver, BC  Fat Girls is a simple and delightful  local production. Invisible Actors Inc.  deliver, with one set and good performances, exactly what a Fringe Production  should. This bizarre comedy is both  entertaining and thought provoking.  Fat Girls add resses the constant pres-  sure exerted on women to be thin, and  examines the damage that results from  this pressure. Two sisters, Lisa and  Bettina, are brought together when they  are told their mother is dying of cancer.  In a bizarre but sobering twist, we are  informed that their mother, Faye  (Marion Eisman) is ecstatic she has cancer. The reason for her joy is she has lost  From Left to right: Marion Eisman as Faye, Tanya Huse as Lisa and  Sharlaine Mclntyre as Bettina in Fat Girls (Wear All Sizes) by Kelley Jo  Burke. Photo by: Emma Cheevers  57 pounds asa result of her unsuccessful  cancer treatments. Eerily enough, this  plot twist seems too plausible, and is  reinforced by her oldest and slimmest  daughter Lisa's (Tanya Huse) fear of  pregnancy. She fears that being pregnant will make her fat.  Society's obsession with thinness is  underscored by Lisa's constant emphasis on Faye's weight loss "mother you  look great." Bettina (wonderfully portrayed by Sharlaine Mclntyre), the  youngest and fattest daughter, drolly  delivers the play's wittiest lines. She  wryly reminds her family that they have  their priorities skewed, "WhatI wouldn't  give for a terminal illness." The scenes  between mother and daughters are dry,  witty and fuel this comedy.  The d ramatic scenes occur when the  characters are left alone with the "mirror" (Jacques LaLonde), which is an  empty frame with the LaLonde standing  inside. The mirror espouses societal  views on weight and reveals how each  character has internalized these views.  Fat Girls opens with the mirror lip- sync  ing to "Young and Beautiful." When  this song ends, the mirror begins to  recite several fat jokes to Bettina.  The mirror is present throughout  the length of the play, but is used to  best effect when each actor is alone  with it. The most moving exchanges  arebetweenBettinaandthemirror.lt  is then that we are shown the pain  that wise-cracking Bettina does not  reveal to her family. The exchanges  between Faye and her daughters expose the familial roots of all three  characters' obsession with their  weight.  One small note of complaint. I felt  that the few references to Alice in  Wonderland did not set-up the ending.  Bettina's symbolic struggle in the last  scene lost some of its intensity due to  this half-hearted narrative technique.  The play seemed to stop rather than  end, and the audience's only cue that  the play was finished were the lights  coming back up. With that said, this  was a truly enjoyable Fringe Production and I look forward to seeing more  work by this excellent team.  FOR THE LOVE OF LUCILLA  Originated by Delia Ann Kenward  Dangling Sister  Vancouver, BC  I was somewhat relieved to see a  play at the Edison Electric Gallery. The  Edison is my favourite video haunt, and  I knew that the seats would be more  comfortable than some of the other venues I had been to.  The seats may have been plush, but  Delia Ann Kenward does not deliver  comfortable theatre. Kenward wrote and  performed this one woman play. The  play opens with a battered Lucilla rushing the stage in a candy vendor uniform.  From the start, Lucilla is frenetic and  sensual. She seduces a young customer  and takes him back to her favourite  make-out places. This is where her lover  finds and shoots her. This is the only  straight-forward narrative we get, the  rest of Lucilla's story is told in flashback  through several characters.  It is a struggle to keep up with the  story, as the characters are constantly  changing. Each character presents their  particular take on Lucilla's life and actions. Through their dialogue, we discover that Lucilla is the wayward daughter, irresponsible sister, beautiful seductress, and untamed spirit. I must confess  that I was confused by Kenward's rapid  character changes. I had trouble sorting  out whether these characters were internal characters or actual people in Lucilla's  life.  The circus setting further blurs the  distinctions between what is real and  what is not. The staging creates an atmosphere of tension and unease. The set  consists of two chairs that are joined by  a long piece of rope stretched out like a  tightrope. The rope reinforces the circus  setting, and the precarious nature of  Lucilla's existence "don't let go of the  rope." Kenward constantly goes under  the rope or ominously balances on chairs,  as she begins to unravel the many narratives of Lucilla's life. Watching her perform this kind of storytelling is intense  and challenging.  Shannon e. Ash is a regularly late contributor to Kinesis.

What happened to  that?  Onodera: I wrote two stories for an anthology  series called Inside Stories. One was shot in Toronto, it was called Then Now. That's a whole  other story. The other one was shot in BC and  was called Heartbreak Hoteru. It was about a  Japanese-Canadian Elvis impersonator and his  no-good gambling brother and was a comedy.  Laiwan: Were they shown? How was it working  with the CBC?  Onodera: The series were made by independent  producers. The CBC had commissioned two  sessions of Inside Stories. One wasToronto-based  only. The other one was a national collection of  stories and they were stories from various cultural communities. So, I guess in a way, mine  was the Japanese-Canadian story but I would  never personally call it that. I didn't really deal  specifically with the CBC other man with my  first show Then Noxv, which came under very  heavy scrutiny because one of the characters  was a lesbian. This was before Roseanne (who  had one of the first on-screen TV lesbian kisses).  Laiwan: And what happened to your Asian  lesbian character?  Onodera: There was a very heated discussion  about an onscreen kiss between two women.  This was about 1988-89. It was felt by the CBC  that since there was only one Japanese Canadian  story, they did not feel comfortable representing  a lesbian character because the public could  perceive the entire Japanese community to be  lesbian or gay. So that onscreen kiss ended up on  the cutting room floor. There was also a state-  mentby the main character about her being gay.  I think that reference also got deleted. But in the  end it was the support and push of the actors in  the way they performed their roles that really  made it an integral part of the story. When Then  Noxv came out, I did get some comments from  people within the Japanese-Canadian community who knew me and knew my work. They  asked why was Ibeing so soft? There wasn't any  knowledge of the censorship that happened and  there was nothing that I could do about it  Laiwan: Can you comment on the rising popularity of lesbian films in the mainstream?  Onodera: I guess with Go Fisli it started to be  trendy and cool to have a lesbian film in your  distribution catalogue. So if you were Orion  Classics or Sony or whoever, you were out there  pushing that untapped market which of course  on some levels helps to raise the visibility of  lesbians in the mainstream. But on another level  what kind of representations are getting out  there? I think that is the big question. What is  deemed appropriate? What is deemed acceptable?  Laiwan: Do you think that these distributors are  channelling what is deemed acceptable?  Onodera: I think at this point, within a lesbian  mainstream cinema, soft romantic love stories is  what is acceptable. I don't cater to that personally. I want to see characters who are multidimensional, who are not perfect, who do other  things besides sleep with whoever. There are 24  hours in a day. What is partly controlling things  is, yes, distribution, but it is also about money  and recouping that money in the world of feature film So, if I was a financially ambitious  filmmaker, I would make a soft lesbian romance.  Laiwan: What is your next project?  Onodera: I think I'm taking a little break But we  are developing another project which is also  supported by the National Film Board, Studio D.  Again it is not a conventional kind of Studio D  film. At this point it's a satirical comedy dealing  with a legend where Jesus did nor die on the  cross but actually lived to marry a Japanese  woman in Japan  Laiwan: But I thought he was gay.  Onodera: Jesus? Oh, maybe that's another film.  Don't miss these  Women Who Write  Jackie Kay from Scotland  and  Canada's Carol Shields, Judith Merrill  and Audrey Thomas.
