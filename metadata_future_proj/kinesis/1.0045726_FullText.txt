Lesbian  meeting  Women involved in changing the conditions and images of women in general, or  lesbians in particular, are invited to a Seattle Regional Lesbian Feminist Conference  which will bring together all aspects of our  political, artistic and spiritual world and  is open to all women. The conference will  focus on why we do the work we do and  how this work fits into the larger picture of  power relationships and social change. The  conference will also focus on the major issues of lesbian-feminism in the 80's and 90's  and consider how to develop and sustain a  radical movement. We welcome lesbians active in all different communities to become  involved in the organizing process.

Access  project  Plan A for access, a project of the British Columbia Coalition of the Disabled, has  launched a sticker campaign that is aimed at  barrier-free design in the marketplace. The  intent of the sticker campaign is to make  building owners and designers more aware  of the importance of barrier-free design. According to the Plan A, all too often people  think of disabled people as only the mobility  impaired but, barrier-free design should in-  relief  A coalition of Canadian non-governmental organizations has launched a co-operative  effort to raise funds for relief and reconstruction in Nicaragua and Costa Rica,  which were devastated by Hurricane Joan  in late October.  Hurricane Joan has left a trail of destruction and floods along Nicaragua's Atlantic  Coast. The death toll is over a hundred and  200,000 people have been left homeless, including 65,000 children under the age of  five. Stores of many of the country's staple  items and almost half the coffee crop have  been destroyed. Meanwhile, the Canadian  government, which originally offered a paltry $250,000 in relief, bowed to public pressure and raised the figure to $1.6 million in  emergency aid.  The Coalition, which includes organizations such as Oxfam, CUSO, Inter Pares,  etc., is asking people to write or call the  federal government to demand more relief  be sent to Nicaragua. Kinesis readers are  urgently requested to contact the Rt Hon.  Joe Clark, Minister of External Affairs,  elude all disabilities such as mobility, hearing and visually impaired as well as seniors  and children.  The BCCD campaign is urging supporters to assist in the campaign by using the  stickers which are available with a A+ Well  Done message, or a D- Needs Work message, above a "Disabled Access" statement.  The stickers are designed for use on specific  objects: doors, elevators, handles, ramps,  stairs, telephones etc. and the Coalition  urges that they be used only with property  owners' permission.

EGALE, an Ottawa based lobbying organization has been building support to pressure the Mulroney government to hve up to  its committment to introduce this amendment. EGALE is urging gays and lesbians,  and their supporters, to write their members of Parfiament, the Prime Minister and  both leaders of the Opposition and demand  that the government respect its committment to full human rights protection for  gays and lesbians.  EGALE also suggests that individuals  and groups can stage events to mark the  third anniversary and so contribute to support building for the amendment's inclusion. Labour unions, religious and social  groups are urged to issue press releases or  write letters to the editor to promote community awareness of the issue.

B.C. Supreme Court Justice Lloyd  McKenzie, Jan. 21, in his summary remarks prior to issuing a  civil court injunction against anti-  choice protesters at the Everywoman's Health Centre in Vancouver.  Plain speech is sometimes a  rarity in legal circles, but recent  events in Vancouver show even  forthright judicial censure isn't always enough to get quick action  from law enforcement institutions  when it comes to policing the extremist anti-choice faction in the  abortion struggle.  Despite a civil court injunction  gained by Everywoman's Health  Centre, Operation Rescue (O.R.),  a U.S. based anti-choice group,  (see box) staged a 15-hour illegal blockade of B.C.'s only freestanding abortion clinic in late  January.  One hundred and fifty O.R.  protesters, initially ignoring police orders to clear the chnic entrance, dispersed only after pohce returned with an enforcement  order backing up injunction provisions. They succeeded in halting clinic operations for 15 hours  while harassing, threatening and  chasing women from the clinic entrance while Vancouver pohce officers watched.  Joy Thompson, spokesperson  for Everywoman's Health Centre,  blames this law enforcement impasse on the provincial government.  "Clearly the Attorney General's  responsibility is to protect the legal rights of B.C. citizens," said  Thompson. "The reluctance to  charge individuals in December,  Refugee women  still at risk  by Noreen Shanahan  A recent Canada Immigration  program intended to loosen entry  requirements for refugee women  and their children is a failure, according to Vancouver refugee advocacy groups.  The 'Women at Risk' program,  launched in February 1988, is  barely a drop in the bucket both  in terms of bringing women into  Canada (less than fifty women  have so far been sponsored) and  meeting their needs once they arrive, critics say.  The program runs under 'joint-  sponsorship' meaning a private  sponsor integrates her into Canadian society and looks after her  emotional needs while the government pays her bills for one year.  No ESL (English as a Second Language) or job training allowances are provided, and the  women are expected to immediately become self-sufficient.  Dr. Jamie Wallin, chair of Vancouver's Christ Church Cathedral  Sponsorship Committee, calls the  program "much ado about nothing," attacking the unreahstically  severe demands put on these trau-  matised women.  One Ethiopian woman sponsored by his church, who has a  grade eight education and no English, was recently told she and her  children would be deported if she  couldn't show proof of 20 places  she had applied for work.  Make no mistake about it, the 'vision' behind Operation Rescue is male.  after O.R.'s first illegal demonstration, has fostered a climate where  these individuals beheve they're  above the law and can breach the  Criminal Code with impunity. The  whole situation has left the pohce  completely paralysed."  The week following the O.R  protest, Betty Green and Lane  Walker, two O.R. leaders who  participated in the demonstration  were arrested; a third, Vincent  John Hawkswell, a Catholic priest,  turned himself in. All were charged  with suspicion of being in contempt of an injunction and ordered  away from the clinic until their  February court date.  Green and Walker agreed to  the restriction while Hawkswell refused; they were released on their  own recognizance.  See Protestors p. 5  " ... (Immigration) doesn't  take into account these women's  special cases," said Wallin. "They  were accepted as 'women at risk'  precisely because they were at risk  in their countries, as abused and  tortured people."  See Refugee p. 5  Operation rescue: preaching hate  Founded in 1986 by 29 year old Randall Terry in New York state, Operation Rescue's conservative agenda  includes control of women, discrimination against gays, acceptance of ADDS as God's punishment and violent opposition to abortion.  Details of financial support for the organization are not clear, but it is assumed that OR, whose membership is primarily fundamentalist Christians, is self-supporting.  OR first attracted media attention in Atlanta, Georgia last year, where, for nine weeks they attempted,  unsuccessfully, to shut down all the clinics in the city. Hundreds of OR members were arrested in that attack because of their illegal tactics. They are instructed by their male leadership to block doors to clinics and prevent clients from entering, supposedly by using non-violent civil disobedience. However, many  OR protests have been marked by violence. Their tactics have included kicking at the backs of knees and  throwing themselves backwards at chnic defenders.  Their manipulation of language resembles the ways Nazis used degrading terms for the Jews and others  to make them seem inhuman and therefore easier to attack. Pro-choice defenders are called "pro-aborts,"  chnics are called "abortion mills" or "abortuaries." OR protesters "fighting to save pre-born children" remain anonymous, only identifying themselves by wearing badges saying "Baby Jane/John Doe, Operation  Rescue."  OR members attacked the Everywoman's Health Chnic in mid-December and again in Jaunuary and  have been staging protests in Toronto for the past month. Pohce action ended the OR protest in Vancouver.  Over a hundred OR protesters have been arrested at Toronto clinics.  Revised refugee restrictions  Refugees who have sought sanctuary in Canada over the past two years have come to the end of a bruising  period of uncertainty and anxiety and will finally learn whether they have found a refuge in this country.  Amendments to the Immigration Act that took effect Jan. 1 are aimed at stemming the tide of "bogus"  refugees into Canada. In addition a new system announced last month is aimed at clearing away the backlog of 85,000 refugee claimants during the next two years.  Under the new program, two person panels evaluate whether a claimant does indeed face danger in the  country she has left. H they decide she doesn't, they have the power to order her deported within 72 hours.  The panels consist of one Immigration Canada adjudicator and one representative of the newly created Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, which is independent of the department.  Under the new process claimants may only appeal panel decisions to the Federal Court of Appeal on the  limited grounds of points of law. On rejected claims, the Immigration department will review whether there  are humanitarian and compassionate considerations (such as whether the claimant has a spouse or children  in Canada) before taking action to deport anyone.  According to Frances McQueen, of Amnesty International in Vancouver, "The new system will be a godsend, if it works smoothly. Genuine refugees need to be able to tell their stories. It's cathartic."  McQueen is concerned, however, that while the process may expedite the claims of people already in  Canada, it may also deal with new refugees so swiftly that no one will have even heard that they tried to  enter Canada.  She also warns that "...humanitarian and compassionate grounds have been interpreted very narrowly  in the past," and cites her concern that appointments to the review panel should be watched closely since  they are pohtical appointments. She is especially disappointed that appeal grounds for refugee claimants  are so limited.  "In such an appeal process" she said, "what you have is two lawyers arguing before three old men about  points of law. It has nothing to do with the refugees, they don't even get to tell their story in court."  In the March Kinesis we will feature an indepth examination of the effects on refugee claimants  of Canada's new immigration policy.

UBC plans pay equity  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The University of British Col-  umbia(UBC), a major Vancouver  employer, is moving to implement  an employment equity program as  required under recent federal legislation.  Under the Federal Contractors  Program all organizations that receive federal government contracts  and employ over 100 people must  develop equal opportunity application criteria The program targets  four groups, women, disabled people, Native people and visible minorities, all of whom are histori  cally victims of systemic discrimination in terms of employment  opportunities and career advancement.  UBC's efforts, however, may be  hampered by a lack of government support for start-up costs associated with the program. Currently, the university has no available data on how the target groups  are represented in the UBC job  pool. According to the university's  personnel director, Eileen Stewart,  collecting such information will be  costly.  "I would suspect to even develop   a   questionnaire   (to   get  the information) the direct cost  would be $25 to 50,000," Stewart  said, noting that UBC processes,  "...20,000 applicants for staff per  year."  The questionnaire, which would  be voluntary, would include questions on whether job applicants  consider themselves to be a minority. Usually such questions are  forbidden in employment applications because of fears about confidentiality, privacy and possible  discrimination, however, they are  permitted for the purposes of positive action programs such as the  federal initiative.  Sharon Kahn, UBC's newly appointed Director of Employment  Equity acknowledges that the program will be expensive but says "it  will make the university a better  place. Systemic barriers have created a situation where the skills  of the targeted groups have been  under-represented in the past."  A budget for the program is  under consideration and it is expected that a process will be ready  by April, the beginning of the fiscal year. Employment equity programming has been cited as one  reason for UBC budget deficit. According to Kahn the university will  "go after matching funds from the  provincial and federal government  to help us accommodate the program."  In Ontario, where there is actual employment equity legislation, the provincial government  provides start-up money for programs. Neither the B.C. nor the  federal government has committed  start-up funding to employers that  fall under the regulations of the  Federal Contractors Program.  Team Vancouver  by Pat Pitsula  Vancouver:  Garbage country bound  by Shelley Anderson  The Cache Creek-Ashcroft area  is being targeted for another environmental assault. Having fought  and defeated the placement of  a proposed toxic waste dump, a  toxic waste incinerator and a B.C.  Hydro coal-burning, electricity-  generating plant at Hat Creek, the  people of the region now face the  prospect of the stench and contamination of a garbage dump servicing the entire Greater Vancouver  Regional District (GVRD).  The site is located on land under claim by the Bonaparte Indian  Band, land considered sacred and  of a claim not yet resolved.  Two streams running through  the site have had to be diverted.  Experts say there is not even  enough land to adequately cover  the landfill, and even now, excavators are running into bedrock.  Groundwater, scarce in this region, will be contaminated by  leachate. These major environmental hazards have been down  played by the Cache Creek council and the private contractor involved, who wish to make this  a model "dump." History shows  that other such "model dumps"  are far from safe or trouble free.  The GVRD produces almost  one milhon tons of garbage per  year, an estimated 95 percent of  which is recyclable. Only token efforts are being made to recycle  in most municipalities. Instead the  lower mainland is about to ship its  garbage headache to another less  fortunate community.  The current landfill proposal  was pushed through by the council of Cache Creek and the GVRD  without public input. Over a thousand signed ballots, sent in by  the people of the Cache Creek-  Ashcroft region rejecting the landfill proposal, were ignored.  The contract for the servicing  of the landfill and the shipping  of the garbage, due to begin towards the end of February, has  been awarded to Wastech Services  Ltd. Complex agreements between  many parties have made Wastech's  proposal economically viable, but  also lock the economies of communities involved into the proposed arrangement.  An elaborate system of transfer stations has also been created  Co-alition  cites crisis  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The newly formed Lower Mainland Native and Ecology Coalition has charged that the oil  spUl on the west coast of Vancouver Island has reached crisis  proportions and is calling for a  "declaration of a disaster area."  The Co-alition, which consists  of 14 lower mainland Native and  ecology groups, is helping to coordinate a volunteer effort to assist  with the clean-up of more than 150  miles of Vancouver Island coastline, fouled by a December oil spill  caused by a collision between a  tugboat and an oil barge off the  coast of Washington state.  The Co-alition is calling for: an  immediate moratorium on offshore  to transfer waste from municipal  garbage trucks to highway vehicles, costing the GVRD millions  of dollars. The more invested by a  community in the landfill method  of waste disposal, the less open it  will be to environmentally sensible options such as recycling.  For more information on  what you can do to stop the  landfill and promote environmentally sound waste disposal  practices contact The Lower  Mainland Waste Management  Coalition, Hilda Bechler 521-  8052 or Shelley Anderson 255-  200 J,.  With Team Vancouver well  into its second year, the organization is now beginning to reach into  the community to fulfil its two-  part mandate: to connect individuals interested in specific sports  with participating social and/or  competitive clubs accepting new  members; and to organize Vancouver's athletes for Gay Games  III - Celebration 90, slated for  August of 1990.  Last October three members of  Team Vancouver attended the  Celebration 90 — "Two for the  Show" Conference. Connections  were made with major cities in  Canada, the United States, and as  far away as France. The conference meetings, both formal and informal, generated an update about  how preparations for Celebration  90 are progressing, as well as helpful information about how Team  Vancouver can best prepare local  athletes for this incredible event.  One of the first items of news for  Vancouver athletes is that early  registration for Celebration 90  begins this summer.  The job of preparing for Celebration 90 is not an easy one.  We extend our hand to anyone  who would hke to volunteer. Team  Vancouver needs help in a variety  of areas: communication, outfitting Team Vancouver for Opening and Closing ceremonies, marketing, and lots more.  For those who might not have  the time but still want to support Team Vancouver in some  way, t-shirts, sweatshirts, tank-  tops, etc., printed with the Team  Vancouver logo, are for sale to individual and groups.  We would love to see you  at Team Vancouver's next organizing meeting, scheduled for  Feb. 9, 7 pm at the Gay  and Lesbian Community Cen-  tre,(GLCC) 1170 Bute St.,  Vancouver.

According to a Co-alition press  release, "Three weeks after the  spill, there is still httle committment from any level of government  to help with the work of saving  birds, animals, sea-hfe and beaches  — not to mention the disastrous  impact on the livelihood of the  native and non-native local people." Some weeks after the spill  the federal government announced  a series of fishing closures to crab  grounds in areas contaminated by  the spill.  Recently, Premier William Vander Zalm was unwilling to pledge  his support for a moratorium on  off-shore drilling. In response to  questions at a business lunch, Vander Zalm avoided any committment to a moratorium saying that,  "... whenever we talk about environmental issues or concerns or  how environmental situations may  be addressed, hopefully we can at  the same time consider the impact  or the effect on the economy."  The Co-alition charging that  "the crisis shows that present spill  clean-up technology is inadequate  in rough seas" is asking for volunteers to assist in the clean-up.  It has called on the B.C. government to provide free bus and ferry  fares to volunteers who want to go  to Vancouver Island to offer cleanup assistance. To date such assistance has been refused and government support to the volunteers has  been hmited to providing one meal  a day.  Volunteers are desperately  needed along with donations of  shovels, rakes, garbage bags,  machetes, rubber and wool  gloves, money and food.

Welfare appeals:  Getting help is the best remedy  by Jennifer Bradley  "The squeaky wheel still gets the grease  in dealing with B.C.'s Ministry of Social  Services and Housing (MSSH)" according  to Jean Swanson of End Legislated Poverty  and as shown in the following stories.  Rosa, with her two children left her abusive husband and found a place to hve that  she could afford. MSSH agreed to pay her  moving costs if she provided three estimates  from different movers. This she did and  her Financial Aid Worker (FAW) authorized the lowest bidder to effect the move.  On moving day, both children were sick so  Rosa had to get a neighbour to look after  them until noon when the neighbour had to  be elsewhere.  When, by 10 am, the movers had not appeared, Rosa became anxious. Not having a  phone, she walked several blocks in the rain  to a booth and received a taped message at  the movers' number. After a couple of these  trips, she phoned the Better Business Bureau and was told that they had received,  complaints that these movers were unreliable and sometimes "unpleasant." Rosa  tried to contact her FAW. Told that she  was "in a meeting until lunch time," Rosa,  now very worried about getting her things  out and the place tidied up before the new  tenants moved in, phoned one of the other  movers from whom she had got estimates.  Luckily he and his helper were able to come  right away and Rosa was successful in cleaning up and retrieving her children in the allotted time.  Rosa felt good about how resourceful she  had been and did not expect the lecture she  got next day when she phoned her FAW  to explain what had happened. The FAW  questioned her closely about her change of  movers and told Rosa that she should have  continued to try to reach her on moving  day and reluctantly agreed to pay the emergency mover.  After leaving her husband, Rosa had applied for welfare in her own name and was  told that her medical card would arrive in  about six weeks. Her children were subject to frequent ear infections for which the  doctor usually prescribed medication. Each  time she got a prescription, she had to make  an appointment to see her FAW who then  made out a form for Rosa to take to the  drugstore. The trip to welfare involved waiting for two buses, waiting for the worker, a  bus to the drugstore and two buses to get  home. Rosa, who often didn't feel too well  herself, had to take the kids with her when  she couldn't get her neighbour to babysit.  The pharmacist finally suggested she ask for  Form HR 430 which she could keep with her  and show whenever she needed medication,  thus avoiding the trips to the welfare office.  The next time, she asked her worker about  it. The worker admitted that such a form  existed, but said that she felt it would be  "better" if Rosa came in each time.  Now Rosa has her medical card and just  hopes she will be lucky and not have to approach her worker with any more requests.  Swanson and her colleagues at End Legislated Poverty, an umbrella organization representing provincial groups which lobby for  changes in the social welfare system, stress  that assertion is a key element in getting  needs met by MSSH. She cites figures showing that as of August 1988, over 36,000  one-parent families in B.C. were on welfare,  most headed by women.  "Many women," she says, "are afraid to  ask for what they want, fearing that assertion will get them into trouble with their  worker."  "The best way," Swanson emphasizes, "is  to let your worker know that you have contacted an organized and recognized advocacy group."  Julia, single mother of three young children, did just that. After separating from  her boyfriend, Julia was under a lot of stress  from the effort of trying to manage on a  minimal income, always owing money, dealing with an abusive landlord and helping her  kids adjust to the changes. She found her-  Freda MacLellan of the Downtown East-  side Residents' Association (DERA) agrees  that negotiation and mediation is usually  effective.

She approached her worker to request a  homemaker twice a week to give her a break.  Her request was turned down because the  MSSH office had used up their allotment for  homemaker services. Her FAW suggested  that Julia talk with a social worker about  putting her children into care for a few  weeks. Of course Julia withdrew her request. Acting on a friend's suggestion, she  contacted an advocacy group. There she  was hstened to and, accompanied by the  group's representative, re-approached her  worker. She quickly got the homemaker relief she needed.  able Income for Need (GAIN) Act defining the Ministry's responsibility to provide  "Aid that is necessary for the purpose of  relieving poverty, neglect or suffering." She  approaches supervisors, area managers and  writes to Ministry officials in Victoria She  stresses that DERA will not handle fraudulent claims, but adds that on "reasonably  based claims for need as defined by the  GAIN Act, someone, somewhere along the  hne will give." MacLellan adds that persistence is necessary and often more persistence than one person alone has.  Both advocates agree that securing support from an experienced group is impor  tant for those experiencing problems getting benefits such as bus fare, daycare and  training allowances. A good advocate, they  say, knows the ropes and how to approach  Ministry representatives on the basis of law  rather than compassion or ordinary common sense.  When persistence, reason and reference  to the GAIN Act fail, what can a welfare  recipient hope for? The next step is to ask  for an Appeal Kit which the FAW must provide. It consists of forms and copies of the  GAIN Act and regulations. The chent must  ask the worker to write her decision  the reasons for it on the form. The chent  then writes down her reasons for requesting an Administrative Review of her case  and files it at that office within 30 days of  the worker's written decision. Her case is reviewed by the Area Manager or his/her designate who has 10 days to give her the decision. (Thirty days if handicapped status is  the issue.)  If the chent is unhappy with the Administrative Review, she can, within seven days,  request a Tribunal Hearing.  An appeal tribunal consists of three  members, one representing the chent, and  one representing the MSSH (who must not  be a provincial or municipal employee). The  panel members choose a third as Chairperson, and must schedule the hearing within  14 days. At the hearing, both sides present  their evidence and reasoning. A majority  decision by the three is considered binding  on the Ministry. Sometimes the decision of a  tribunal may be appealed in a court of law.  The detailed strategy necessary is not included in this summary of the Appeal process, which is why it is so important to  contact an advocacy group which will have  both experience and copies of useful publications by B.C.'s Legal Services Society.  Obviously the process is time consuming,  one more reason, state both Swanson and  MacLellan, why mediation is usually preferable.

Protestors from page 3  Pohce have outstanding warrants for at  least eight other protesters whose identities  are known, and "other persons unknown."  Pohce are hampered by protesters remaining anonymous, identifying themselves simply by their Baby Jane Doe and Baby John  Doe name tags.  Thompson calls O.R. blockades "only the  most visible part of O.R. strategy. They're  effective because they involve chnic staff  and organizers in endless meetings with pohce and with lawyers, appearances in court  as witnesses, and just generally trying to figure out the next step.  "And despite lofty declarations of willingness to go to jail for the sake of 'preborn  children,' when the pohce returned with arrest warrants O.R. people just scampered  away from the chnic hke naughty children,"  Thompson said.  Thompson denied media reports that  pro-choice supporters will counter-demonstrate if there are further O.R. protests.  "The chnic is a medical facility not a  battleground," she said. "Now that the injunction process is fully established, and  there are outstanding arrest warrants, we  sincerely hope there will never be a need for  volunteers to protect chnic access."  Despite the 15 hour blockade women were  still able to have their abortions, she said.  "And we'll continue (performing abortions)  regardless of blockades, in the spirit of last  years' Supreme Court ruhng which gives  women freedom of choice in Canada."  Thompson said legal battles with O.R.  have generated increased chnic support.  "Supporters' outrage convinced us to call an  emergency rally for January 28," she added,  the anniversary date of the Supreme Court  ruhng.  "We're planning a mass mobilization for  March 5 to coincide with International  Women's Day celebrations. We beheve it's  essential to tell the federal government, and  other levels of government, that they have  a responsibility to represent their constituents, and that constituency is overwhelmingly pro-choice.

Leslie Anderson of Vancouver's YWCA  (sponsors of two women) criticizes the program saying no daycare allowance is provided yet women are told to leave their  homes each morning and look for work.  "It's as though the government brings  these women into Canada and then conveniently forgets them."  Initially discouraged by the low numbers  of women entering Canada under this program, sponsors are becoming increasingly  frustrated with misinformation from Ottawa.  Wallin says several congregations have  applied to sponsor women but the bureau  cratic wheels have barely been set in motion. He's also been told joint sponsorship  opportunities will decrease.  "When we say we're now willing to take  another woman at risk they say 'we'll try  to find you one, but it won't be government  sponsored, you'll have to pick up the full  tab.'"  Anderson also beheves this change of policy is happening, calling it a ploy by Immigration to throw responsibility for these  women entirely into the hands of private  sponsors.  Adrian French, Vancouver Settlement  Officer for 'Women At Risk' denies knowledge of this pohcy change, adding since the  program is still In it's early stages, "... it's  success can't be measured."  KINESIS Across Canada  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Gwen Bird  Poor and  ignored  For the past 22 years single parent families in Canada have been increasing at a  faster rate than two-parent families, according to a report from the University of New  Brunswick. Prepared for Canada Housing  and Mortgage Corporation, the report fo-  cusses on Atlantic Canada and finds that  most single-parent families in the region are  headed by a woman who lacks adequate  housing and whose only income is social assistance.  The study said the majority of women  who head single-parent families are aged 25  to 44, while most male single parents are  from 45 to 64. Furthermore, the highest incidence of single parent families occurs in  small communities and rural areas where  housing options are limited, employment is  scarcer and services hke daycare are not  as available as in urban centres. Rural single parents were found to have lower levels  of education than their urban counterparts,  particularly post-secondary and job training.  The study urges a closer look at the service gaps in rural areas so that government pohcy can be developed. It also recommends that levels of social assistance be  re-evaluated and that the question of equal  access to education for single parents be ad-  uity Act (EEA) and to call on the government to take concrete action. In response  to a motion by NDP MP Lynn Hunter  that the government introduce legislation to  force employers to pay equally for work of  equal value, employment minister Barbara  McDougall stated such legislation "creates  resentment" and doesn't work because rules  are difficult to Mow.  Restrict ,  arms trade  The Canadian peace group Project  Ploughshares has urged the federal government to place stricter controls on sales  of Canadian arms components. The group  points out that billions of dollars worth of  weapons containing Canadian parts are sold  to countries that consistently violate human  rights or are at war.  Wage gap  unchanged  A December report released by Statistics Canada showed the wage gap between  women and men is not being improved by  federal government programs.  The report stated that women earn an  average of 65.9 percent what men do.  Women employed full time made an average of $21,012 in 1987, while men earned  $31,865, leaving the ratio unchanged from  1986 figures.

Corporate income taxes now amount to  15.6 percent of total federal tax revenue,  while in the mid-70's they accounted for 26  percent. In response, Finance Department  officials say that current tax reforms should  raise the percentage to 17.2 percent after  five years.  At the same time, federal subsidy and assistance payments to business have grown  faster than the share given to social program spending.

Abortion  policy  challenged  February 14th has been set for the New  Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench to hear  Dr. Henry Morgentaler's legal challenge of  provincial abortion policy.  Morgentaler is asking the court to force  provincial medicare to pay for abortions  he performed for three N.B. women at his  Montreal clinic. Under current N.B. policy the province will only pay for abortions  in accredited provincial hospitals and after  two doctors state the procedure is medically  necessary.  Morgentaler has also said that he will set  up an abortion chnic in N.B.; the provincial  government plans to fight it.  Student  victims  A survey at the University of Manitoba  found that one in six female graduate students had altered study plans to avoid sexual harassment. Respondents said they had  avoided taking a class from someone or  choosing a thesis supervisor because they  "knew or had heard" that person was a harasses  The survey was co-written by Marilyn  MacKenzie, the university's investigation  officer, and Thelma Lussier, the director of  institutional analysis. Lussier commented,  "We feel that this has a potential for a real  limitation for women's educational oppor  tunities," and stated that Mackenzie would  work with the university to find possible solutions.  U. of M. policy established in 1984 defines sexual harassment as ranging from unwanted sexual attention to sexual bribery.  The questionnaire was distributed among  students, staff and faculty. Forty-five percent of people responding said they beheved  anyone who complained about sexual harassment would "suffer in some way." Sixteen percent of women and four percent  of men reported having been sexually harassed.  Wardair  woman  censored  The Canada Labour Relations Board has  upheld Wardair's decision to suspend flight  attendant Senka Dukovich for comments  she made to the media about her company.  In March 1987 Dukovich criticized Wardair's treatment of women flight attendants,  stating they were treated as sexual objects  and used as window dressing in advertising.  Dukovich filed complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on behalf  of the Canadian Union of Pubhc Employees (CUPE), but the case has not yet been  heard.  In at least two newspaper articles,  Dukovich was quoted as saying Wardair applied pressure on women to shave their legs  and underarms and wear an approved bra,  while others were warned about being overweight and having "unsuitable" hairstyles.  She also stated that older flight attendants  were pressed to quit.  In response, Wardair suspended Dukovich —a 15 year employee—for two weeks  without pay. CUPE asked the labour board  to investigate unfair labour practice.  In its decision, the labour board stated  that Dukovich had not overstepped her  bounds as a union representative by going  to the media with her concerns, as Wardair  claimed. However, finding "no evidence" to  back up some of her complaints, they ruled  that Wardair was justified in its suspension.  Nancy Steele  Res. (604) 254-0941  Champlain Realty Ltd.  Bus.

KINESIS  Feb. 89 Across Canada  Report slams government games  by Noreen Shanahan  Illustrating the Canadian federal government's grossly ineffective early attempts at women's  equality in the workplace, Nicole  Morgan writes:  " ... it was as though the  government had knocked at the  door of a private club and said:  'Gentlemen, allow me to introduce  these charming ladies. Part of my  electorate (especially the female  part) thinks that you've been doing wrong not to allow them into  your club and I hope you'll do your  best to set things right.  'So please share your power,  your salaries, your jobs, and your  territories with them. And now  I really must run, I've a million  things to do.' "  In The Equality Game:  Women in the Federal Public  Service, published by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, Morgan argues that  as the largest employer of Canadian women, the government has  both the power and responsibility  to create a model workplace.  Instead, 1987 statistics show  women constitute only 8.7 percent  of the Executives and 13.2 percent  of Senior Management while 82.8  percent are employed in the traditional female job ghetto of Administrative Support.  Morgan's research traces the  years of struggle in establishing  the affirmative action programs  of which the present government  boasts. She also exposes numerous  examples of rampant discrimination, harassment and intimidation  directed at women—particularly  evident during the present day  'downsizing' of the civil service,  when jobs are tough to get and  even tougher to keep.  In 1961, parfiament voted a  new Civil Service Act expressly  prohibiting discrimination on the  grounds of race, national origin,  colour or religion. Gender discrimination wasn't mentioned.  The following year the Glassco  Report, which revolutionized management in the civil service, devoted one page out of 1,198 to  women, saying "while there was  no official discrimination against  women in recruitment, selection,  classification or pay—in practice, a  number of differences in the treatment of men and women could  be considered discriminatory-"  (emphasis added).  It was another ten years before women were seen as "a political issue" and faltering steps were  taken by the government to clean  up their own house.  Deputy Ministers were sent a  declaration of intent (called a directive) asking them to promote  women's advancement to middle  and upper management positions;  Morgan calls this "A directive  without direction," freeing the  government to posture but enforcing no change.  "That the directive was merely  a motherhood statement was painfully obvious," she writes. "The  law had not been changed and no  directive for compliance had been  set forth. It was inevitable that  the public service would continue  blithely on its way."  The following eight years, leading up to the 1983 application  of so-called affirmative action programs, women desiring more responsible and better paid positions  met tremendous barriers, almost  entirely from 'threatened' male coworkers.  Some women were promoted  into 'trash-can jobs' where they'd  be equipped with incompetent  staff; others got 'vacuum jobs,'  where they'd be expected to be  glorified secretaries to male assistants.  Other women were promoted to  'booby-trap jobs' and threatened  by particularly impossible bosses;  or 're-arranged jobs' where their  tasks were altered little by little.  One woman Morgan interviewed  described her experience in a rearranged job: "I landed in a management job and a few weeks later,  they took away all the management part. I found out from a secretary in the washroom."  Morgan also describes cruder  methods of intimidation at the  application-stage: female candidates were pre-selected from files  containing their photographs.  "In addition to thinly veiled  contempt," she writes, "women  experienced ostracism, isolation,  punishment, physical intimidation, the formation of cliques, rumours, intellectual intimidation,  and sexual harassment."  She also learned about the unofficial practice of circulating lists  of 'suitable' and 'unsuitable' (also  termed 'difficult') women for man-  "It was a stroke of genius," said  one woman. "Even if the fists don't  exist, everyone talks about them.  It makes us toe the fine."  In 1976 there were 89 female  and 4,140 male executives. This  imbalance seemed strange, writes  Morgan, considering between 1972  and 1975 the number of women  in the public service increased by  30.5 percent and only 13.3 percent  for men.  With the advent of International Women's Year (1975) and  federal elections that promised to  be a close race, "Women would  have to be courted more persuasively," said Morgan. "The public  service, whether it wanted to or  not, would have to do better."  That year Jean Cretian, President of the Treasury Board, out-  fined equal opportunity objectives:  within a reasonable time frame,  men and women should be equally  represented in all departments and  at all levels.  "... it is more than a polite suggestion that something be  done. First, although no specific  date was mentioned, the phrase  'time frame' was there, with the  word 'reasonable' added, implying  that the excuse 'these things take  time' would not be so readily accepted," said Morgan.  It wasn't until 1983 that the  government established an affirmative   action   program  in   the  entire federal public service for  women, the disabled and aboriginal people.  Due to the lack of quotas, however, Morgan says this wasn't affirmative action.  "... there is a big difference  between an affirmative action program and an equal opportunity  program. The difference is that the  former actually seeks to remove  discriminatory barriers, whereas  the latter less ambitiously tries to  redress inequalities by setting targets."  'Quota' was an ugly word to bureaucrats who feared that the run  ning of affairs would fall into hands  of incompetent women.  "Tokenism had to be avoided  at all costs. To meet this objective, an affirmative action program  was initiated which enshrined the  merit principle, ie. to select and  promote only qualified individuals," said Morgan.  She points ou4 that the merit  principle had conveniently just  come back into vogue. It was  rarely discussed during the years  corresponding to the veterans' return from two world wars, when  the public service became what  Morgan calls "the largest reserve  army in the country."  The Veterans' Preference  Clause, said Morgan, was the  longest and most powerful affirmative action program ever applied in  the federal service, as well as being  the least contested.  The merit principle also tended  to be forgotten towards the end of  the 1960's during the wave of bilin-  gualization, she added.  Although some women are slowly creeping into the upper echelons of federal public service, Morgan predicts the "bottom of the  ladder" will always be reserved for  women. H this is so, she notes, one  might question whether this is really progress.  Free trade  Workers to pay the piper  by Kinesis Staff Writer  Amidst growing concern from  anti poverty groups about the long  term effects of free trade, two federal government appointed groups  have fined up with the Progressive  Conservative government's stance  that adjustment programs are not  needed for workers negatively affected by free trade.  In December testimony before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Economic Council of  Canada, supposedly an independent economic analysis organization, said it was opposed to special aid for those who are unemployed as a result of the free  trade agreement. The Senate committee's report concluded the parliamentary process for approval  of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade  Agreement (FTA) and the bill implementing the agreement received  royal assent in late December.  According to Council Director  Judith Maxwell, a Mulroney appointee, it would be unfair to  give special treatment to workers who lose their jobs as a result of the deal. Existing programs  which provide assistance for training, counselling and moving assistance, if workers must relocate to  find jobs, represent sufficient government sponsored initiatives for  workers affected by free trade.  Saying that it would, in any  case be impossible to identify  specific workers who have been  disadvantaged specifically by the  trade agreement, Maxwell told the  committee that management and  labour, not government, must assume most of the responsibility  for adjustment programs. Government assistance, she said, should  be limited to assisting older workers and those who work in remote  areas of the country.  The Economic Council's perspective on adjustment was echoed  by the federal government's Advisory Committee on Adjustment,  which is to produce a report on  adjustment needs by the end of  March.  Such advice ignores recent reports from the Canadian Advisory  Council on Women that federal  government job training and job  creation programs (known collectively as the Canadian Jobs Strategy) are seriously inadequate. According to the Advisory Council, government employment programs serve women poorly since  they concentrate on providing  only short term employment and  almost exclusively offer women  training in low paying, entry level  positions which provide little opportunity for advancement.  In the face of such strong appeals for government inaction on  free trade as it affects the average worker, it is httle wonder  that social pohcy advocates are  bracing themselves to defend social security programs from business groups clamouring for a review of social program spending.  According to Havi Echenberg,  executive director of the National  Anti-Poverty Organization, "The  corporate sector has been engaged  in a ten year war on social spending and the free trade agreement  gives them a nuclear weapon."  Echenberg, and others, fear that  business, citing a need to be  competitive and reduce Canada's  deficit, will use the trade deal as a  big lever with government to bring  social programs in fine with less  generous U.S. programs.  While some beheve the Mulroney government will not dare  tinker with social security programs in the face of election  promises to protect them, others  are not convinced that the Conservatives have any such good intentions.  According to the National  Council on Welfare, millions of  dollars have already been whittled from social spending since the  Conservatives first took power in  1984.  KINESIS International  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^^  China  Individual happiness  goal of student elite  by Lenna Jones  When I asked my fourth year  university students to write on  their predictions about fife in the  year 2020,1 was curious to see the  results.  Teaching at one of China's nine  foreign language universities, in  Chongqing, the third largest city  in China, I am meeting students  who are more sophisticated, better educated and more influenced  by foreign ideas than all but a very  small percentage of the Chinese  people. (Of course, a very small  percentage of over one billion people is still a large number!)  The fourth year students are  20 to 22 years old. To get into  university, they had to pass a  number of stiff exams at different  points in their primary and secondary education. So only those  with the highest motivation, who  studied virtually all their waking  hours when they were children and  teenagers, even got to attend university.  Nevertheless, these young women, while they certainly hope to  k at interesting jobs, see their  futures within the traditional family. In the compositions of the 16  women in my fourth year class,  husbands figured prominently in  the descriptions of eight of them,  when talking about their lives in  the year 2020. Eight mentioned  a child, of whom five specified a  son. None specifically mentioned a  daughter.  In discussions with young women at my university, both students and teachers, I have yet to  find one who does not support the  one family-one child policy. While  they disagree with many aspects of  government policy, this is one policy they support wholeheartedly.  Most mention two reasons: the impossibility of raising China's standard of living to first world levels  unless the population is stabilized;  and the difficulties for women if  their family burdens are too great.  I have been told that in the  countryside, where 80 percent of  the population lives, most people  would not so readily support the  one-child limit.  Eleven students described ways  in which technology would make  all work, especially household  tasks, easier and swifter. They  have actually seen many such improvements in the past five to 10  years, which do, in fact, lighten the  load of household work. More and  more urban families have refrigerators, semi-automatic washing  machines, gas stoves and gas hot-  water heaters. Each such change  improves the quality of women's  lives in a country in which each  household task takes a quantity of  time and energy unknown to most  of us in developed countries.  Interestingly enough, not one  student mentioned her husband  sharing the household work as a  way of easing her burden. Perhaps  more advanced technology seems  more likely than more cooperative  husbands.  One student did specifically  mention that there would be sexual equality in the year 2020, but  Fetal deaths linked to gas  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The pesticide that escaped from  a chemical plant in Bhopal, India  more than four years ago has been  finked to a high incidence of stillbirths and spontaneous abortions  among pregnant women who were  exposed to the gas.  In a study of 850 Bhopal women  who were pregnant at the time of  the gas leak, Doctor Daya Varma  of Montreal has found that, more  than 40 percent subsequently lost  their babies. Almost 3,329 people  were killed as a result of the leak  and more that 200,000 were injured. Twenty thousand people in  Bhopal still suffer lingering health  problems because of exposure to  the leaking gas.  According to Varma, the research provides strong evidence  that the poisonous gas got directly  to the fetus. Methyl isocyanate,  the toxic chemical in the gas leak,  is still widely used in diluted forms  in many parts of the world to prevent insects from destroying agricultural crops.  Varma's accompanying labora  tory studies on mice showed that  methyl isocyanate can poison laboratory mice without having an effect on the mother. The chemical  spreads very rapidly to the fetus  across the placenta.  she gave no details as to what she  meant by this.  Nine described their jobs, virtually all of which were as managers  of some kind or another. Given  their educational level, this is  probably quite realistic. A woman  must be better qualified than a  man to get a given job, but these  students are members of an educated elite whose talents and skills  are desperately needed to modernize the country.  Although there is a real interest  in getting good jobs, many of my  students take it for granted that, if  her boyfriend gets a job in another  city, she will try to move to where  he is located and get a job there.  In most cases their own jobs, and  even the part of the country they  hve in, is clearly secondary to their  boyfriend's careers.  Many expressed hopes in their  compositions for the improvement  of hfe for the Chinese people as  a whole, but these hopes were  less central than their personal  dreams. This result seems quite  typical of this generation, all of  whom were born during the Cultural Revolution. Many of the  older generation see both good  and bad in the Cultural Revolution. The impact on young people, however, has been to make  them quite cynical about pohtical  involvement, and to think that a  great interest in society only leads  to excess and fanaticism. There  is discussion of this in the press,  as it bodes ill for the future if a  whole generation rejects pohtical  involvement.  In fact, the one political idea  that excites many of the young  women I know is Women's Liberation. This is the one social  movement—or hope—that they  are prepared to talk about at  length. Most see it in terms of  jobs and educational opportunities. Only a few can even imagine great changes in personal relations. A handful, who see that  women are quite oppressed within  marriage, say they will never  marry. Given the realities of Chinese life, however, in which marriage is the rite of passage into  adulthood, it is doubtful that they  will maintain this position.  In short, then, I see a group of  young women who are optimistic  about the future, which they generally envision in personal terms.  Most believe they will be prosperous, have interesting jobs, and  be happy with their husbands and  children. I too beheve their future  is hopeful. But I also believe that  more struggles on a personal level  and more involvement on a social  level will be necessary in order to  realize this improved future for the  women of China.  Groups curtailed:  South Africa  by Kinesis Staff Writer  The South African government  restricted the pohtical activity of  32 organizations in 1988, according to the Human Rights Commission, a private monitoring group  based in Johannesburg. By comparison the government curtailed  only 24 organizations between  1950, after the first apartheid legislation was enacted, and 1987.  All but one of the 32 restricted  groups were identified with the  struggle against apartheid. The  single exception was a small far-  right group of white die-hards  called the White Liberation Movement.  The latest restrictions were imposed in late December against  four organizations: the National  Detainee Forum, the Democratic  Teachers Union, the Western Cape  Students Congress and the Western Cape Teachers Union. They  are forbidden to engage in any political activity, though they have  not been declared illegal as are  many other groups, including the  African National Congress, which  is seen by the great majority of  black Africans as the legitimate  representative of the African people.  Families  top arms  budget  by Kinesis StafT Writer  Japanese women fight name law  by Kinesis Staff Writer  : women are organizing  against a century old law which requires married couples to use the  same name. Article 705 of Japan's  Civil Code requires couples to use  one surname—either the wife's or  the husband's. Over 97 percent  of couples choose the husband's  name.  Reiko SeMguchi, a university researcher, is suing the government  and her university charging that  the impact of the law limits her  ability to build her reputation as  a researcher. SeMguchi, who publishes her research under her own  name, must be listed in her university's directory under her married  name, one which none of her academic colleagues recognize. When  SeMguchi applied for a grant the  university turned it down because  she applied in her own name. The  university refuses to issue her a  paycheck in her name, claiming  that since it is supported by state  funds it must uphold the law.  Over 500 Japanese women have  joined groups opposed to the law.  Over half of the married women in  Japan work, and women make up  nearly 37 percent of the workforce.  Surveys conducted on the issue  find that while unmarried women  often want to change their names  when they marry, many change  their minds later.  Swedish parents have won 18  months of paid parental leave after the birth of a child as a result  of recent changes in Swedish law.  Both mothers and fathers are eligible for the benefits which see the  state compensating 90 percent of  lost income to the parent who remains at home.  Sweden's Social Ministry estimates that in the current year  the cost of parental insurance will  be the equivalent of $2.5 billion.  The proposals, together with Sweden's other generous family support measures, earmark more for  family support than is allocated  for the country's defense budget.  A total of $7.9 billion is allocated  for family support, compared with  5.7 billion for defense.  Some of the benefits that flow to  Swedish families from the state include a monthly child allowance of  $107 and heavily subsidized daycare services. Parents pay one-fifth  of the $9,500 annual cost of keeping a child in daycare. Eighty-five  percent of Swedish women with  pre-school children work.

She's been  at it for 11 years; the enemies are imaginary.  Dulce is part of a respected and even  mystified elite, the karate black belt. Only  one student in 1,000 makes it. In all of  Canada, there are a few hundred at this  level—a tenth of them are female.  Like most women who pursue the martial arts, Dulce had some very practical  reasons for learning how to fight. She was  raped at knife point and appalled by her  inability to defend herself. "Before karate,"  she says, "my body was unknown territory.  Now it's a powerful tool. My whole presence  has changed. Everything that I learn in the  training hall carries over into the rest of my  fife."  To become accomplished in the art of  karate involves a serious committment. Although anyone can learn the basic moves in  a few lessons, it takes hundreds of hours to  perfect them. Progress is measured by belt  levels from white to black, with up to ten degrees of black. Formal tests are mandatory  to pass from one level to the next. Students  spend many hours worMng on kata, which  are a series of fighting techniques strung to  gether in ritualized forms. After a certain  degree of proficiency is achieved, the student can move into free sparring—worMng  with a partner.  "The effects of training are very profound," Dulce says. "Nothing else challenges me so thoroughly on all three levels—  physical, mental and spiritual." Women  who train are up against an additional  challenge—society's stereotype of women as  nurturers, not fighters.  Karate is a heavily male dominated art.  In most classes, women are outnumbered by  men ten to one or more. The odds can be intimidating, especially if you're out of shape  and are expected to perform 100 situps and  50 pushups on your first night.  "I've been lucky," Dulce says, "the men I  trained with have been very supportive, but  some women have been given a hard time."  Mai Hamaguichi is a third degree black  belt, holder of the All-Japan Shitoryu  women's kata championship. WMle visiting  Canada last year, she picked up first place  at the B.C. Winter Games. In her school in  Tokyo, however, she was expected to launder the men's training uniforms.  Other women have been ridiculed in their  attempts, or subtly pressured to "not be so  Members of the Shito-ryu Karate club emerging from English Bay after the annual  mid-January beach practice.  "We're reluctant to give you the black  belt," said an instructor, "you'll probably  just have babies and stop training." The  woman he was addressing, Cathy Nodan,  had been called into the school office for  a consultation with tMs man and the Sensei (chief instructor). She had just been informed that she failed her first attempt at  black belt. Later, she overheard the assistant talMng with another male black belt.  "If we give the black belt to girls, we might  as well give it to children," he said.  The steady influx of women into karate  over the last 10 years has forced some of  the patriarchs of the art to re-evaluate their  positions. Five years after the incident in  the office, Cathy Nodan had the pleasure  of watching a black belt presentation to  a woman four months pregnant. "Sensei  has learned a few things," she remarked.  Most women who persevere, report encouragement and comaraderie from men they  train with. "They have to respect you," one  woman said, "you're worMng out just as  hard as they are."  Over the years, Dulce watched too many  women quit in frustration. She saw the need  for a supportive environment, to ease into  the rigours of training, and established West  Coast Women in Karate, an all-women's  club.  "It was very successful," she says. "The  club spirit was high and my students  did well, in training and in competition."  Women were encouraged to start gradually,  building up their stamina. Discussion times  were scheduled, to allow for an airing of  fears and difficulties. The women were also  offered the opportunity to train once a week  with men.  One of B.C.'s best kept secrets is its reputation for producing some of the top female  karate competitors in Canada. Women like  Sarah Satow, Norma Foster, Molly Hand,  Ingrid Bischoff, Tanya and Rassama Ling  are unknown outside of karate circles, but  have been bringing home medals from national tournaments for years. Some have  been successful in international meets. In  1984 Norma Foster became the Commonwealth women's karate champion. Because  karate is not an Olympic sport, the fierce  competitions held regularly receive little  publicity.  Some women, like Sarah Satow, seem to  thrive on competition. Sarah is a stern looking woman who is all business in the ring.  It is said that "she fights hke a man," and  it's meant as a compliment. She has also  THE ENGLISH BAY SWIM CLUB  cordially invites you to participate in the  1989 INTERNATIONAL  GAY AND LESBIAN  AQUATIC CHAMPIONSHIPS  SWIMMING, DIVING, WATER POLO  EASTER WEEKEND MARCH 24-26  All events to be held at the Vancouver Aquatic Centre  Entry deadline Feb. 20 $25 entry fee  For info and registration call:    John 689-0334 or Dirk 669-2382  Sarah Satow  been described as "one woman who could  compete in the men's division and probably  win." This year, she's not training much because she's in her second year of dentistry  and on a schedule of classes, studying and  virtually nothing else. For a break, Sarah  flew down to Calgary on the Remembrance  Day weekend to compete in the Western  Canadian championships. "I'm almost at  the end of my competing career," she says,  "but I want to compete at the world level  at least once before I quit."  Although Sarah has been successful competitively, she insists that it is a small part  of her involvement in karate. She rates her  involvement with teaching and the personal  challenge that karate offers as much more  important. Also, she says, "I have a bad  temper. Training really helps it. It's like a  battery to draw energy from. I need it."  Sarah was attracted to karate by chance.  As a teenager, this natural athlete was a sM  racer on Canada's National SM team. That  career ended after she was badly hurt in a  sM accident. Among other things, her injuries negatively affected her balance. She  was recuperating in Kelowna by worMng  out in a community centre. One day, she  happened to see a karate class in progress.  "The instructor was standing there on one  foot for about five minutes," she said. "I was  very impressed. I went into karate looMng  for balance."  For some women, competition is like taking medicine. "I never look forward to it,"  one woman said. "It scares me more than  anything, but I always learn something, and  have a good enough time that I'm willing to  try it again."  While the concept of women fighters may  seem like a new idea, it is in fact centuries  old. The martial arts spring from a common source—the Shaolin temple in the Hunan Province of China in the sixth century. In this and other Buddhist communities, women and men lived together and developed the unique combination of breathing, philosophy and deadly fighting arts.  There are many folk tales of women warriors, including the story of Fa Mulan, a  Chinese woman whose heroism in battle is  still celebrated. Women are credited with  founding several styles of kung fu. Japanese  women born into the samurai class were  once trained to use a full range of weapons.  Maxine Hong Kingston, the author of The  Woman Warrior suggests that perhaps  women's feet were later bound "because  they had been so dangerous."  Today's female karate-ka describe an addictive quality to the practice. They are  proud of the strength and confidence karate  has brought them. Ans Steenman, a blue  belt, summed it up by saying, "People who  know me now can't believe that I used to be  a total wimp. They think I've always been  strong."  KINESIS Abortion  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx^  ^x>SS^^x^xx^^  The stories women must tell...  by Alice Starr  The year was 1968. If my experience had  occurred in 1969, I might not have this  "story" to tell and yet perhaps in 1989 it  again could be commonplace for thousands  of women in Canada. Abortion: the grim  reaper patiently awaits the peripatetic decisions of men who hold court over the hves  of invisible women.  I did not want to be pregnant and knew  that to carry a baby to term would kill me.  Mentally I was completely incapable of surviving nine months of pregnancy and delivering a baby.  Perhaps these appear to be insufficient  reasons and nothing that a good dose  of backbone and a stern lecture couldn't  straighten up. However, the complexities of  my particular fife had brought me to tMs  point unprepared and totally desperate. (A  doctor had assured me that I was sterile  as the result of another gynaecological gar-  roting.) To deliver and keep a baby created a mass of implications for a basically  unskilled, single young woman. To imagine  delivering a baby into the arms of a waiting couple was impossible to even conjure  as mentally I knew that I could not survive either the nine month period or aftermath. There were significant personal reasons then, and never have I regretted my  decision. Although, I regret the incredible  ordeal of physical and emotional pain I had  to endure.  First I tried the legal route. I visited  two general practitioners and one psychiatrist. I had to have been raped (ideally by a  brother or a father or maybe 50 bikers) or  totally insane and most preferably a combination of all before a legal abortion would  even be considered. Actually, at the time,  I had never heard of anyone ever having  a legal abortion. All the doctors furtively  warned me against an illegal abortion. I res-  ...never have I regretted  my decision. Although  I regret the ordeal of  physical and emotional  pain I endured.  olutely expressed that there was no doubt I  wouldn't obtain an illegal abortion if I had  no alternative. (For women in this state of  mind, indeed, there is no alternative.)  One of the doctors, a woman and also a  Catholic, impressed on me the importance  of bringing the foetus to the hospital after I  had the abortion. It was a given that "they"  would be patching me up and then there  could be no suspicion that they had performed the abortion at the hospital. She reiterated the fact that they wouldn't touch  me unless I brought the foetus in. They  could lose their license while I only had my  hfe to lose.  There was rumour of a doctor up near the  University of British Columbia who "did"  abortions but my grapevine lacked access to  this elitist knowledge. (Later I learned of a  doctor who performed very safe abortions  in an office on West Tenth Avenue.)  After exploring every avenue of information available I heard through a friend of a  friend that a phone call to a pharmacist Ed  at a drugstore down on "SMd Row" would  provide a source. This was all very "cloak  and dagger" with code words and finally an  appointment time to meet the pharmacist.  I had to meet him in the back room of tMs  dusty dreary drugstore located almost directly under Vancouver's Georgia Viaduct.  He was surprisingly young and very edgy  but we managed to arrange a plan once  he determined that I was not an undercover cop. I felt dirty and naked as he eyed  me suspiciously and I feared being sexually  attacked in this room remote from public  scrutiny. After all, he knew I was "easy." I  sweated profusely and prayed to leave there  alive.  The abortion cost 250 dollars in 1968. It  would be the equivalent of me trying to obtain perhaps 1000 dollars today. (TMs is my  estimate and relative to my personal financial state.) Desperation can produce miracles. I obtained the 250 dollars, a large  amount of it by deception and dishonesty.  To tMs day I understand and forgive myself  for what I was forced to do.  The next stage involved sitting by the  phone day and night waiting for the call  from "Mike," a taxi driver whose mobile occupation was a convenient cover for his more  lucrative job as an abortion middleman.  He finally called me from a phone booth  and told me the address to go to and the  time.  My friend, Roberta, my support throughout tMs whole experience, came with me  and waited in the car. I was not allowed to  bring anyone in with me. An apartment in a  high-rise in the West End contained the underground clinic. Two middle-aged women  with beeliive hair-dos were running tMs operation like a doctor's office although the  apartment was just an ordinary suite. For  some reason, I had assumed that I would be  the only one there for an abortion, whereas  there were four or five other women sitting  around the living room.  My first impression was that none of  these women were hke me and I was surprised, but back then I thought only young  "liberated" women "get caught." There  were women of all reproductive ages and  colours, including married housewives, prostitutes and others. We were all sorts but  there was a sense of steely unity amongst  us women who would meet only under such  adverse and unusual circumstances. There  was an unspoken recognition that we were  women who would not be dictated to, would  not be herded into hospitals to have babies that we would despise or deliver hke  surrogate baby-machines for faceless others.  I wish now that I could remember more  clearly but after 20 years of trying to forget  there remains but images and feelings.  Then my turn came and I was shown into  the bedroom wMch served as the "operating" room. I removed my underpants and  placed myself on a towel on the bed. A towel  that had no doubt been used by others. A  catheter was inserted into my vagina up to  my cervix or maybe further by one of the  beeMved women. I have no memory of her  personally—I did not hke or dislike her as  she was just the anonymous abortionist and  yet I was impelled to trust her with my fife.  I was told to put on a sanitary pad to hold  the catheter in place (it was quite uncomfortable). She gave me a quantity of quinine  tablets to take with me and ingest at regular  intervals. Supposedly tMs would "weaken"  my system and in combination with the irritating and now somewhat painful catheter,  I would abort.  Roberta and I went back to my home  where my mother was waiting. She knew  what I was doing and although she could  not condone my action as she feared for my  life, she was supportive emotionally and tacitly understood my decision. I spoke to my  mother recently, who is now 80 years old,  and we opened up tMs wound of a memory. (TMs is a shared experience that has remained unspoken until now ... the silences  in our hves.) Her most immediate reaction  was one of anger—at the whole ugly situation personified by the male doctor who first  treated me at the hospital. (The husband of  the woman doctor who had stressed the importance of "bringing in the foetus.")  Roberta, my mother and I went without sleep as we nervously waited for "some-  tMng" to happen. I paced and sweated and  popped more quinine pills. Approximately  24 hours later the pain started. Searing,  cutting pain that prevented me from lying down or standing up. I remember being hunched over like some timeless woman  in a field with secretive intent to dispel tMs  imposition to my very existence.  septicemia was claiming my hfe. The clock  ticks quickly when septicemia starts to rampage the body. (TMs gruesome condition is  often the partner of back-street abortionists.) Both my arms were hooked to the I.V.  lifelines sending in the modern medicine  to fight tMs scourge. Medical people whirl  around me with the business of creating  miracles out of massacred flesh. My journal  reads:  # A room, a cross on the wall, maybe there  is a God! No one cares but I had fooled  myself up to tMs point. Silence and loneliness is preferable to lies ...  A nurse sits with me all night taking my  blood pressure constantly. They aren't going to let me slip away on them now.  I live. Doctors come en masse to see me.  I am a special case where whole medical  classes surround my bed to peer intrusively  into my vagina and examine the wonder  that the modern day abortionist creates.  They actually wait a day to do surgery on  me when the "head" gynaecologist can be  available to perform. I can hear again but  ...I start to get crazy. Perhaps now I would be  judged insane enough for a legal abortion. I start  to scream and scream and they bring out the pills,  25 mg. of librium three times a day.  In the journal I kept at the time I read:  • ... Pain and nausea—Nausea to the  point where death would be an easier  relief. Violent gasping, pushing, contractions then finally the result. More pain  not as intense for a short time. Then  extreme frightening feehngs. No, I really didn't want to die with nausea for  it passes. Shock, hysteria, calmness? ...  Deafness ... Ringing and crying out "I  can't hear you, I can't hear you!" Will  I never be able to hear people talMng  again, sounds that now seem unbearable  to five without. Blood, blood, blood ...  My memory is a flash of incredible pain,  flowing blood and the clot that was the foetus saved for the posterity of doctors to examine. Meanwhile, I had gone totally deaf—  my world was not only one of impossible  pain but also deatMy silent confusion. (Today I read in medical texts that quinine can  inflict permanent injury upon the auditory  Roberta and I caught a taxi to the hospital. I was swathed in towels beneath my  clothes to stem the bleeding. My mother  phoned the doctor to tell Mm I had gone  to the hospital as directed and he warned  her to bring in the foetus or else. The one  small bit of humour in tMs whole morbid  scenario was that my mother went to the  wrong hospital with the clot in the jar. At  that time Roberta was serving as my translator at the Emergency ward. It was frightening not to be able to communicate but my  deafness had rendered me mute. Then everything became hazy as I started to drift  into a different world, perhaps a safer one.  Fragments of the initial hospital scene  remain. The doctor leaning over me shaking his head. I interpreted the shaMng  as anger—he was disgusted by my act.  Roberta told me later that he was not sure  that I was going to make it. The poison of  my humiliation is such that I almost wish  the silence would once more engulf me. I  am a medical mannequin to be prodded,  poked and penetrated with instruments and  stares. Never was so much interest shown in  my state of health prior to the abortion but  after it I have become an exciting "case" for  everyone to examine.  No one counsels or soothes me that I can  remember except my girlfriends. I turn 21  years old in the hospital puke green cell of a  room. "One friend listens and I cry and cry.  Soon I am hysterical." There is talk of police coming to the hospital, after all, I have  committed a criminal offense. I am so angry  and hurt and sad—I start to get crazy. (Perhaps now I would be judged insane enough  for a legal abortion.) I start to scream and  scream and they bring out the pills (25 mg.  of librium three times a day):  • PUls subdue me so that I can't fake being  a maniac. I wanted to go out in a straight-  jacket but instead I quieten down. Lights  dim and I become paranoid for I can't remember where I am. Finally sleep.  A week later I was released from the hospital. A month later I was unknowingly addicted to hbrium, very anemic and still dripping green pus from my vagina.  Twenty years later as I write tMs it is  difficult to suppress the tears. I have never  had the "heart" to make my voice heard on  the abortion issue from a truly personal perspective. Now is the time—when the neo-  conservative tide sweeps over society with  their emotional pleas for only the unborn.  In B.C. the answer is proposed in an unrealistic plan for family support which the Social Credit government espouses in defense  of their fundamentalist views. I feel like  screaming—women will always seek abortions no matter what pohcies and planmng  are introduced. Therefore, in the name of  humamty, make them legal and clean.  KINESIS 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/y////y/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/y/yyyyyyyyy/yyyyy/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.  ///////////////////^^^^^  //////////////////////^^^^  Abortion  Choice:  regardless  by Alice Starr  The abortion issue has created a division  not only in the femimst movement but also  between friends and family. My premise is  simple—the right of self-determination as  documented in the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights by the United Nations  should be an inherent part of Canadian society. Therefore women would not have to  go begging an abortion if that is what they  choose.  When abortion is discussed, inevitably  the question of birth control is raised. If  women used birth control properly, carefully and responsibly there would be no  need for abortion. Then the ultimate admonishment: some women actually use  abortion as a method of birth control! Generally people shrink and collectively mouth  diatribes at these women who express such  truly immoral behaviour. It is not my purpose to explain away or justify women who  have had to resort to multiple abortions.  An examination of the society which created the need in these women would provide a more definitive explanation.  Therefore in telling my personal story, I  believe that in focussing on how tMs situation could have been prevented is to cloud  the issue. Pregnant women should have the  right to choose abortion if they wish regardless of the circumstances surrounding conception.  Historically women have always found  ways to interrupt a pregnancy. My own  grandmother had to have an abortion for  reasons that were valid to her—and that is  the issue that has to be addressed; women  should have the right to determine their destiny as it is intrinsically hnked with their reproductive system. This is never an easy situation for any woman although the moralists would have us beheve that it is for bad  and recalcitrant types who resort to abortions. As Carol Gilfigan in In A Different  Voice explained, "morality lies in recognizing connection, taMng responsibility for  the abortion decision or taMng responsibility for the care of the child."  Religion, which is one of the strong arms  of the patriarchy, has always found it easy  and efficient to extol an absolutist philosophy in relation to women's reproductive  rights. The implications of women having  the freedom to determine whether they will  bear babies are deeply threatening to the  foundation of the nuclear family and ultimately society.  Pregnant single women are a big part of  tMs picture if everything runs according to  plan—they should be encouraged to give  up their babies for adoption to supply the  empty nests of traditional nuclear families.  H these pregnant single women decide to  keep their babies, society is sure not going  to make it easy for them by providing sufficient support and funds to maintain a comfortable standard of living. Therefore these  women better get busy and find husbands if  they know what's good for them and return  to the family flock.  Abortion is not an easy decision especially when the law makes a crime of the  act. As Gilfigan states, "the concern is pragmatic and the issue is survival. The woman  focuses on taking care of herself because she  feels that she is all alone."  In GHligan's book she writes of a college  student who felt her only chance of "saving her fife" was to have an abortion. This  was my experience and obviously the experience of most women who have known the  paradox of risMng their fife to save their fife  when abortion is illegal.  A feminist perspective focussing on the  intra-psychic forces and interpersonal relationships in a woman's life could be used  to rationally explain the need for abortion.  Unfortunately the political system that was  present in 1968 constrained any justifiable  logic for abortion. At that time there was  even less economic support for single women  than now and I had no access to information  which would have made any other choice  possible.  The many appendages of the patriarchal  hierarchy expressed their displeasure at my  "crime." History records the Mdden acts  of women and they are always punished  whether it be by death or "merely" emotional and physical scars. The political system which writes the law of the land admonished me. The medical establishment with  its male dominated authority refused me,  reprimanded me and in the end cMvalrously  saved me to again exploit my body and  soul. The police system didn't pursue me to  the extent they searched for the abortionists but I was made very aware of their presence. The abortion "ring" was a deviant patriarchy in and of itself, one that threatened  the larger structure and therefore more important to destroy.  These systems all still exist except for the  illegal abortion system wMch would emerge  instantly if the powers that be disallowed  the right for women to obtain legal abortions. Political pressure by women changed  the law therefore it is essential that the pressure be continued because laws can always  be overturned. The survivors of the dark  ages of just 20 years ago have to speak out,  no matter how painful, or else our younger  sisters will come to know the shame of reproductive slavery.

I Building Women's Inequality  IA growing body of research shows how the  I urban environment contributes to women's  ■ inequality. For example, a project carried  I out in Toronto in 1985, called "Women Plan  I Toronto" by Reggie Modfich, encouraged  1 women to examine all aspects of arcMtec-  I ture and urban planmng and its relationsMp  J to their fives. Women stated that a shortage  I of decent affordable housing, lack of available child care, inadequate transportation  systems and lack of personal safety in public places makes fife difficult for them.  Several studies have added additional  factors that discriminate against women:  isolation in the suburbs, poorly designed  homes (where males often get the priority spaces!), lack of public spaces that accommodate women with children (for example there are no spaces where infants can  be breast fed), male intimidation in public  spaces and lack of access to environmental  decisions.  Gerda Wekerle, who teaches Environmental Studies at Toronto's York University argues that two aspects of existing urban policy particularly oppress  women—transportation planmng and residential zoning by-laws.  She points out how women's dependence  on public transportation affects their ability to take paid work. Mothers are generally responsible for taMng children to child  care and picMng them up. As a result,  women tend to confine themselves to a much  smaller work-preference area than men do,  and tMs either diminishes women's chances  of competing in the job market or limits  them to lower-paying local jobs.  -   £^L  Wekerle also shows how zoning requires!  the segregation of home and work: it (  eludes home-based businesses in residential-"  neighbourhoods, thereby making it moreg  difficult for women to combine work and!  family roles.  Zomng limits  the location  of child care facilities and often forces*  women to travel out of their neighbour-F  hoods. Finally among zoning ordinances^  wMch require the construction of single-■  family homes on large lots and exclude mod-^  erate and low-cost multifamily units dis-d  criminate against women, who comprise ap  large proportion of the low-income population.  Another Canadian writer, Glenda Jow-r"  sey, writing in Herizons, deals with public  space. She says that "urban public space is  a fearful place where women are at risk."  She argues that convincing "women they  are always unwanted and at risk in urban  public space not only deprives them of the  pleasures of the 'street' but, by discouraging their presence, increases or creates the  danger and the inhospitality of the 'street'  to them as well."  Wekerle argues that "Canadian cities are  planned by men for men." Not only are  there few women in the arcMtectural and  planmng professions, "but when we look at  how houses are designed, how neighbourhoods are laid out, how transportation systems are organized—they are still planned  as if most women were in the home full time  and as if the predominant family were the  nuclear family."  Other recent studies show how "the design professions are male dominated and inherently sexist in their view of the world,"  and how "this results in sexist environments."

Another study stresses that zoning by- '  laws should require child care spaces in all  housing developments and public buildings.  Still more studies point out that the environmental needs of women in crisis are  not being met: rape crisis centres, abortion  chnics, midwife-run birth centres, women's  health chnics, storefront legal services, battered women's shelters, emergency housing  for victims of rape, and halfway houses for  women prostitutes, alcoholics, addicts and  prisoners.  Finally, women need political and social  spaces, such as women's resource centres,  women's presses, femimst credit unions, lesbian centres and femimst schools.  According to L.K. Weisman, in Heresies, "These places and spaces represent  new architectural settings wMch reflect  both radical changes in our society as well  as glaring evidence of women's oppression  and disenfranchisement."

Most employed women, says I  J Hayden, desire supportive community ser- T  vices and solutions which reinforce their  economic and social independence and maximize their personal choices about child  rearing.  Who Runs the Sandbox  Sexual inequalities have always existed  within the architectural profession. Carolyn  Johnson in her annotated bibliography on  women in architecture, states that: "Women  have always represented a small percentage of the number of practicing architects  ... This representation has been based on  the premise that architecture is a 'man's  profession'." Traditionally it has been assumed that "a woman lacks the technical intelligence, the stamina and the practicality  in business matters necessary to become a  competent architect." Is it any wonder that  in 1988 only nine percent of the total registered architects in Canada are women?  whole other side to tMs  itudy showed that architecture  was once primarily a women's field and that  suppressed until very re-  * tMs study stated that  years of studying and practicing  arcMtecture, she discovered only two years  ago that in nearly all the early civilizations  women were the original builders, and that  they sti^ fulfill this role in many developing  countries. And in my own research, I have  also just discovered many early woman architects.  I Women's Structures,  ■ Women's Visions  Do women architects design and conceptualize space differently than men? Margrit  Kennedy, an architect, argues that the  shape architecture might take in response  to female priorities and values cannot be  described with the same certainty as the  traits of the arcMtecture dominated by male  values. However, says Kennedy, there are  some examples of so-called anonymous architecture, remnants of settlements of matriarchies, and built examples from female  architects that suggest that there would be  a significant difference between an environment shaped mainly by women and female  values and one shaped by men and male values. She continues to say that although it is  impossible to define clear and exclusive categories for female and male architecture, it  may be possible to distinguish female and  male priorities in architecture.  For example, she sees the female princi-l  pie as being more user-oriented and moreH  socially-oriented, whereas the male prin-.T  ciple is more designer-oriented and morel  profit-oriented. She also argues that women!  are better prepared to be architects "byB  I virtue of having been trained in childhood*"  to be person-oriented, emotional, and later  having been formally trained to be rational,  logical and abstract."  In From Tipi to Skyscraper: A History of Woman in Architecture, Doris  Cole, also an architect, claims that because  women have rarely been part of the organized arcMtectural profession, they have  used their arcMtectural skills indirectly toward improving the social and physical  character of the environment.  Ellen Perry Berkeley, a prolific writer  on the subject of women and arcMtecture, shares similar views to Cole's. In New  Spaces for Women, she argues that many  women beheve the profession is not doing  its best for the users of buildings, and some  of these women are bringing a femimst perspective to this critique. For example, one  arcMtecture student investigated the physical barriers to women with children; she  found that stairs and doors do not permit  a baby carriage to pass. As well, there is  a growing awareness that many public and  private buildings, and public space generally, is inaccessible and unsafe for people  with disabilities.  But socialist femimsts have a somewhat  different view. One such architect, N. Ron-  danim, writing in Heresies, claims that it  is not possible to derive an exclusively female architectural style, and that women do  not have a different architectural sensibility,  but that they have a common history of oppression. She stresses that women arcMtects  should not assume that their imagination is  free until their condition is also free. She believes the goal of arcMtects should be to seek  an alternative to a capitalist, racist and sexist use of architecture and tMs would require  a radical economic and political change.  A British femimst design collective called  Matrix argues that arcMtects who are  women and/or come from a worMng class  background, are forced to acquire an outlook similar to that of middle class male architects. In Making Space: Women and  the Man-made Environment they say,  "we shouldn't expect buildings designed by  women to have any qualities distinct from  those designed by men." They state that:  "The possibility of women architects adopting a different attitude depends in part on  the existence of a femimst movement ...  The consciousness of women architects in  the past has partly reflected the state of the  women's movement at large, so that recent  growth in awareness of femimst issues may  offer a new potential for femimst design."  What is not clear about these arguments  is whether a femimst analysis of building  can only come from women outside the profession, or whether a femimst perspective  emerges through the struggle and is conse- ,  quently limited in scope by the traimng pro-  Feminist Architectural Activism  Several femimst critics argue that more femimsts must become arcMtects and more architects must become femimsts. There are a  number of possible strategies for tMs:  • Feminist arcMtects should try to encourage more women to enter the arcMtectural and building professions, and to ensure that more young girls receive career  advice in schools on future employment v  in the arcMtectural, planmng and build-  ing professions.  • Female arcMtects should promote a "fem- j  inist analysis of how urban environmental decisions typically occur and how the  results adversely affect women." Theyl'  should   raise  these  environmental  de-j  sign and planmng issues within exist-1  ing women's movement groups; and they *  should also promote built environment is- 3||fj  sues in women's studies programs.  • Women arcMtects should try to estab- m  lish all-female schools of arcMtecture; and m  they • should try to encourage a femi- S!  nist historical perspective in all exist- ?£  ing schools of arcMtecture and planning.  Reclamation work needs to be done on  women arcMtects because much of their  work has been credited to their male colleagues.  • Women architects should establish independent group practices that cater  to community groups and grass-roots  women's organizations; and they should  set up women's networks to share job information and expertise.  Fortunately, all of tMs is beginmng to  happen: To encourage tMs femimst activism  among arcMtectural students, some faculty  members in the Environmental Studies program at Ontario's York University have developed entire courses on issues important  to women. The necessity of an all-women's  academic institution was a view shared by  the group of American women who started  the Women's School of Planmng and Architecture (WSPA), the first school to be  completely founded, financed, and run by  1  WOMEN & ARCHITECTURE  Women in/and Planning, is a Toronto based group that pro- -  motes the modification of urban environments to better meet women's needs. A goal  of tMs association is to organize a series of  exMbits and competitions to popularize the  presence of women in arcMtecture.  On a more general note: Lobbying ef-  forts among women are crucial, and one J  focus for future lobbying efforts might be 8  the inclusion of the socio-economic needs of j  women and their children as a prerequisite «  for approval of new development projects. &  For such projects, writer and arcMtect, Do-1  lores Hayden suggests a coalition of design- J  ers, planners and citizen groups.  In New Space for Women, a group of 2  femimst writers and planners suggests the I  following additional strategies for increasing d  women's roles in creating environments to 1  meet our needs: First, "the modification of Jt  existing design and planmng decision pro- j  cesses to include more input and control by 3  women users," and second, "strengthening I  the economic base and sMlls of women so 1  that they have the resources as chent groups 1  to create their own environments with the i  assistance of women's environmental design I  and planmng professionals."  As Weisman says, "women must act con- j  I sciously and politically"—we must become y  environmental activists, and work collec- 5,  ! tively for change. We have the strength of |J  [ numbers and we could be a powerful voice j  towards creating a more humamzed envi-'  ronment.  Further Reading  • Cole, D. (1973).

The body's capacity to resist disease,  whether it be a simple cold or life-  threatening AIDS, depends on a simple  strategy—the ability of certain wMte blood  cells to guard against unwanted organisms.  H our body Ms to do tMs for whatever reason then undesirables such as viruses, bacteria or fungus can multiply causing tissue  and possibly organ damage. In order to resist tMs possibility our bodies need to be  given the tools to maintain a healthy immune system.  A healthy diet is essential. Vegetables  (orgamc if possible), whole grains and beans  (as free as possible from pesticides and  additives) are necessary as well as letting go of highly refined foods, sugar and  caffeine. Two foods that have immune-  stimulating properties include the sMtake  and ganoderma mushroom and garlic. Also  dark green and orange coloured vegetables are important for their carotene levels.  B-carotene is the precursor to vitamin A  wMch is essential for proper immune function.  Contrary to popular belief fruit juices  are not a good idea in treating acute infections. Orange juice especially has been  shown to inMbit the production of the much  desired white blood cells. Stick to herbal  teas and/or vegetable juices.  Limit your intake of tomatoes, beef, potatoes, pork and peanuts. These contain ei  ther high levels of pesticides if not organic,  hormones or as in the case of peanuts, an  aflatoxin that can cause allergies.  Eating regularly with smaller more frequent meals helps to stabilize the body. It's  also very important to determine if you have  any food or environmental allergies. Unusual susceptibility to environmental toxins  or foods may be a result of an overworked  immune system.  Candidiasis (overgrowth of yeast) can  also wreak havoc so be aware of overcon-  sumption of antibiotics and other drugs  which prime you for tMs.  Vitamins and minerals necessary are: B-  carotene or Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin  E, all B Vitamins including Folic acid, Zinc,  Manganese, Selemum. Iron can be used  in chronic infections but it is not recommended for acute infections as supplemental iron can aggravate the condition.

It's best to consult a naturopatMc  doctor, or herbalist for type and dosage re-  qmred.  Massage and hydrotherapy are also useful  especially since they encourage the lymph  system to eliminate waste. Colon therapy  aids in the removal of toxic by-products of  the digestive system. Increasing fluid consumption helps decrease mucus and aids the  kidney in their eliminative function.  Psychoneuroimmunology (mind-brain-  immune system) is the effect of thoughts  and behaviour on our immune system. New  research is showing that imagining yourself  healthy really does have an effect. Cultivating a positive attitude, loving yourself, getting the support you need to manage stress  well, spending time close to those that love  you, getting hugs all play into tMs. It's also  important to cut out recreational drugs and  alcohol, and to practice safe sex.  Remember by nourisMng yourself physically, emotionally and mentally you will find  yourself a healthier and happier person.  Maureen McEvoy ba ma (Cand.)

They look into each other's eyes pause  and begin barking. If you listen closely,  they're barking in tune. Aya's canine vocal tricks allow their voices to loosen-  up and enable them to present the listener with unstrained warm vibrant pleasing sounds. Aya's members, MicM McCune,  Norma Jean McLaren and Uschi Schnell,  have voices that together, create some of  the most radiant and compelling a cappella  pieces i've ever heard. And they've just released a solo cassette ...  AYA: (of Indian origin) a "nanny"  or loving child minder.  Like a mother who nurtures and helps  her children grow, Aya sings us songs that  lift the spirit and strengthen our resolve to  move on/hold on in the world. On a basic  level, their songs give the hstener, in MicM's  words, "support, sustenance and celebration."  The hfe force that moves through these  womyn's bodies into sound into harmony  into our ears into our bodies surges in easy  waves. Personally, after a difficult day, Aya's  music nourished and encouraged me. Also,  hke a loving minder, Aya sees every human's struggle for social and economic justice as a struggle for all; hence, they pour  out their words songs and caring for those  who struggle. The new Aya! tape is a benefit for AIDS Vancouver.  i must admit that the emotional impact  experienced during a hve performance is  rarely achieved on tMs tape; namely, some  songs sound a bit hollow or lacking in textu-  ral depth. There's a slight hiss on the tape—  i find tMs distracting. Not to fear—several  songs are beautifully mixed and the over-  dubbing expands the sound creating an aural landscape that Aya can't reproduce on  stage. "The Digger's Song," "Trouble" and  "Briget Evans" are powerful and haunting,  they lose nothing on tape.  Aya: a Celtic goddess; mother of all  things.  In the Centre, there is a mother of all  tMngs, in our centres, there is spirit and  emotion. Empassioned with the struggle for  freedom, their songs commumcate in a direct manner: Aya sings with heart to our  hearts. Norma Jean feels that "music is  very effective and moving. You can get  whole groups of people doing something  they wouldn't normally do."  Both Uschi and MicM agree, saying that  music gets past mind barriers, slipping in  where spoken ideology might not. During five performances by Aya, i have been  moved to tears. Listening to the tape, i often smile, sigh or sliiver. Aya wants to expand their political/emotional message and  sing to wider audiences—the tape is allowing them to do that. School Mds and coworkers alike are letting Aya's songs inside,  letting the music touch them.  Aya: the fern as a symbol of defiance  in an African culture.  For Aya, singing is a political act. As ^  Uschi so eloquently put it, "I will not sing a  airhead lyrics." Seriously, with songs about 1  peace activists, witches, bad bills, and bad \  deals, these womyn are not just a choir— c  their singing is activism. The songs are  not only enjoyable, they're educational as  well. "Witch Hunt" engages the hstener  with its layering and luxurious harmonies  and demonstrates the relatedness of all oppressed people's struggles. Aya sings about  striving angry dreaming people.  Though there are some problems in production and a few stumbling moments on  tMs first solo release, Hold On to tMs tape, i  guarantee it will delight your ears and warm  your centres.  Custody book timely  by Lea Dawson  IN THE NAME OF THE FATHERS  The Story Behind Child Custody  by Susan Crean  Toronto: Amanita Publications, 1988  Canadian women are losing their children, and it is a bitter and heart-breaMng  loss. These are children women are capable  of raising and, furthermore, are more than  prepared to continue to raise.  Only recently has it dawned on femimsts  that the new battle with the patriarchy is  being fought over child custody. Men argue  that the courts are biased against them and  that "the women's movement has gone too  far." Politicians are listening.  Susan Crean has written a book about  the Canadian experience. She documents  the history of child custody decisions in  tMs country, and lays to rest the myth of  maternal preference. She describes the unnerving rise in popularity and influence of  a vindictive minority—the father's rights  advocates. She develops a critical analysis of mental health professionals and their  role in custody decisions. She exposes the  faulty and simplistic tMnMng behind enforced joint custody and mandatory mediation. And, she reviews the American experiment in custody reform, as a lesson for us.  Crean is generous with women's stories,  stories that are mostly anonymous but tell  us about poor and affluent women, immigrant women, lesbians and women who  •don't fulfill the romantic "ideal" of motherhood (i.e. deserve to lose their kids).  In two famous cases, she gives us undis-  gmsed details: the story of Gail Bezaire, a  SUSAN    CBEAI  IN THE  mm  OF THE  THE STORY BEHIND  CHILD  CUSTODY  Aya members (counter-clockwise)  Micki  McCum  Schnell.  lesbian mother who kidnaps her two children from their abusive father and fives  underground in the U.S.; and the case of  JoAnn Wilson, who is murdered by her husband Colin Thatcher, MLA.  These are also stories of white, middle  class male power, of legislators blinded by a  misplaced sense of "fairness." As an example, Crean cites the whirlwind adoption of  access enforcement legislation in Ontario in  contrast to the fifteen year lobby for maintenance enforcement by women. All tMs, despite the evidence that access is a problem  in only 15 percent of cases, whereas maintenance default applies in 85 percent.  Crean also describes the reluctance of  politicians and policymakers to accept the  widespread incidence of child sexual abuse,  and the bias of the legal profession to doubt  the testimony of women and children. Finding popular support from the newspaper  and magazine articles about false accusations, laws are being proposed that "would  enshrine the belief that access denial-by  women is a more urgent and worrisome social problem than the violence and sexual  abuse perpetrated by men within the fam-  ily."  Crean's femimst analysis reaches full  force in her discussion of joint custody. She  confirms that enforced joint custody has  been a disaster for women locked in unresolved disputes with former husbands, and  that battered women and abused children  are particularly vulnerable. She reminds us  that men are already using threats of joint  custody as a bargaining tool to reduce maintenance and property division claims during divorce settlements, and that there is  little evidence that joint custody, when enacted, makes them more forthcoming with  the bucks.  Susan Crean has offered us tMs book as a  rallying cry. Few femimsts will read it without being moved, or without identifying the  need to be alert to what is happening.  Norma Jean McLaren and Uschi  KINESIS S*aS**^:SSSS**S^^^  Arts  Arts  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Women In View  Eclectic festival     Smashing hit  As early as Saturday afternoon it was plainly evident that Women In View was a success. With many sold-out houses, audience support far exceeded the 50 percent mark organizers had expected for tliis fledgling event. Also, performers and audiences were clearly  enjoying themselves, which was one of the major goals of the festival  As well as scheduled performances of theatre, music, dance, storytelling and readings,  there were art installations in the stairwell and washroom, "ambient" theatre and improvisations in the lobby, and a gigantic mask created by Evelyn Roth draped around the  corner of the Firehall Theatre, with eyes inspired by Benazir Bhutto.  The festival, in the works since 1986 when the View society was formed, did not have  the marginalized feel of so many women's events. Its support and impetus seems to be  broadly based in the arts commumty, and their description of the festival as "the human  experience from the perspective of the female artist" reflects tMs attitude.  Organizers are accepting applications now for next year's festival, wMch may have to be  longer or in a larger venue if tMs year's crowds are any indication.  Throughout the coming year VIEW will hold workshops; and, every second Tuesday beginning in March there will be play readings. MembersMp is $10. For more information  call 875-6210.  by Maura Volante  I Wasn't Born Here  One woman tells her wrenching story  of leaving El Salvador, living illegally in  the United States, and finally arriving in  Canada to confusing new reality of cold  wMte faces and the omnipotent English language. The audience cries.  Another woman gets locked out of her  apartment while collecting her milk, unable to commumcate with various anonymous voices on the intercom. The audience  laughs.  Amazingly, none of the performers except  director Lina de Guevara had any theatre  experience when they started work on the  project. Lina obtained funding from the Job  Development Program of Canada Employment Centre, and worked with the cast for  six months before opening the show in Victoria in July of 1988. In addition to performing all the parts, the women also collectively wrote the script, based on true experiences of their own and of others in the  immigrant community.  At the end of the piece, they invited everyone onto the stage to share bread and  talk, forming the bridge (puente) they have  taken for a name.  of gospel, after years of struggling with the  Christian content.  However, tMs production just didn't have  it. Granted, the four singers (Lovie Eli,  Lovena Fox, Sibel Thrasher and Marcus  Mosely) had to struggle to be heard, but I  am not convinced that they could have carried it off even with better amplification.  The four, who are best known from the  Arts Club revues, Ain't Misbehavin' and  the Black and Gold Revue, are primarily musical theatre and pop singers. They  have not dedicated themselves to the gospel  form, even if they did grow up with it. The  nuances of the gospel style were missing  here—the wild leaps of voice and phrasing,  the driving, trance-inducing repetition of  certain phrases, and the drawn-out, reprised  endings.  Instead, we were left with beautiful  songs, sung in polished and sincere manner, but without that overwhelming passion  brought to the music by those who live and  breathe it.  M.V.  Tell Me Another Story,  Sing Me a Song  Tell Me Another Story, Sing Me a  Song was brought to the VIEW festival all  the way from the Yukon, by the Dawson  City Drama Club, and one of the two actors is well know in the Vancouver femimst  community.  So, I really wanted to hke tMs production, and I did ... sort of. Diane Freed and  Ane Braga did well with the material, altering voice and movement mannerisms convincingly as they represented forty years of  a mother/daughter relationsMp. The use of  large blocks to create walls and connections  at least gave them something to do, even if  the symbolism was rather obvious.  But I found the play to be too full of  cliches and pat progressions, as they dealt  with the night fears of a five-year-old, the  struggles of adolescence, and finally the  night fears of the aging mother.  Of course, cliches are so cliche because  they are true, and the struggles are familiar  to mothers and daughters alike. But the language in tMs script by Jean Lennox Todie  distanced me from the feelings, leaving me  less moved at the end than I had hoped to  be.  M.V.  by Jeannie Lochrie  Puente Theatre Project  Still another woman, overcome by nervous tremors, finally confesses to the priest  her intention to take her own hfe in the desperation of isolation. The audience is chilled  in horror.  In a succession of scenes and monologues,  Victoria's Puente Theatre Project takes  the audience on a journey from the death  squads of Latin America, through confusion, frustration, isolation and finally empowerment.  It's Time to Sing  It's Time to Sing was a big disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too  high, as most of my experience with gospel  music has been in the form of choirs with  instrumental accompaniment, which naturally have more energy than four unaccompanied voices. It is tMs energy, tMs driving  power which finally turned me into a fan  Reading Writers  Reading from an intensely female-centered vision literary luminaries Angela  Hrymuk, Paulette Jiles, Lee Maracle, Daphne Marlatt and Caroline Woodward read  to a solidly packed room. Topics usually  not heard at hterary readings were heralded  loud and clear from these fine women writ-  Together the readings spanned the spectrum of female existence. Hryniuk read  poignant works centering on incest and  healing; on mother-daughter demal/disclo-  sure of sexual abuse. Jiles moved the listeners to metaphysical heights with her piece  on the Arctic calling the hsteners of Shaman  Radio to Wake up! Wake up! to the angels  who travel in and through the aurora bore-  alis.  Maracle spoke powerfully of Native experience; of the untimely deaths of friends  and family; of love of daughters and lovers.  She moved us all with an anti-police violence chant in her native tongue. Much  to the audience's pleasure Marlatt transgressed boundaries with her selection describing menstruation: "Writing the period  with no full stop." Caroline Woodward  wooed the audience with her hilarious short  stories centering on the rural fife of young  women. Her last piece, a cautionary tale,  urged young girls to act like a Comanche  warrior in the face of male sexual predators. Like most of the hsteners I could have  stayed for more.  Medusa  Unfortunately, not all was hght. Medusa,  written by Audrey Thomas, was deadly  dark and dreadful. On a completely dark,  unlit stage Thomas poses as a reporter for a  woman's magazine, with Martha Miller who  gave a fine performance as Medusa.  Thomas' Medusa is a stereotypical witch.  However, some scholars, femimsts among  them, beheve that originally Medusa was  the Muse; she inspired artists to create;  she was the guardian of the alphabet. Her  look turned male trespassers into stone. The  snakes on her head and around her waist  symbolize wisdom; the snake being the oldest symbol of female wisdom.  You would never know tMs from Thomas'  interpretation. Her Medusa is jealous and  spiteful, she is truly a monster. Sadly, the  Muse is reduced to a woman who places personal ads for bhnd men (so they can't see  her monstrous looks); and, she passes away  eternity "zapping" at random whomever  she chooses, turmng victims into stone "garden ornaments" out of boredom.  The mercifully short 15 minute work ends  with Medusa-Mrs. Gorgon screaming the  gods are gone. Kill the goddesses! Kill the  goddesses! Presenting patriarchy's version  of Medusa is overkill; surely women writers  have a duty to present a more enhghtened  vision of our symbols instead of validating  the witch as hysteric stereotype. This is history, not herstory.  J.L.  The Oldest Living  A definite highlight was the reading of  Pat Smith's play The Oldest Living to a  sold out room. The two actresses playing  lead roles sank their teeth into their respective juicy roles as a lesbian couple in their  70's and 80's.  Muriel becomes the recipient of $10,000  when she becomes the oldest hving resident  of Ebbings, Sask., but the play is really  a tribute to their 35 years together. The  Oldest Living brims over with good humour, puns and wonderful scenarios, and,  of course, much poignancy.  The reading by the fabulous cast assembled and directed by VIEW's originator  Jane Heyman was like being soothed and  nurtured before a blazing fire. The audience was ecstatic about the work. The Oldest Living surely deserves to be staged and  toured.  J.L.  by Yvonne Van Ruskenveld  Four by Eight  These four independently created dance  pieces came together beautifully in a collage  of sound and movement.  The opening "Moments of Laughter" by  Hildegard Westerkamp was an interplay of  sounds between a taped child's voice (the  composer's daughter) and Debbie Boyko.  Boyko's strong voice sMllfully wove the  woman's sounds, songs and poetry in among  the cries and words of the child.  "Eole et Cendrillouse" began as a more  conventional piece but soon challenged us  with its use of sound (taped instrumental  and voice), movement (often grotesque) and  string. Taut strings crisscrossing the stage  at neck level strained to contain the performers. My appreciation of Monique Leger  and Sook-Yin Lee was hampered, however,  because the narrative and dialogue were all  in French. A few program notes would have  helped me to appreciate their interpretive  talents as well as their technical skills.  Kerry McLaren—Search  Barbara Bouget's "37" began slowly and  darkly with tightly controlled floor movements. Gradually she flowed with the music  upwards towards a fighter energy. But she  seemed out of control in the final flapping  and leaping and some of the impact of the  piece was lost.  The classical music for the "Search" by  Gisa Cole was startling after the unconventional sound and music in the earlier  pieces. Susan Elliott, Jean Kwan and Kerry  McLaren moved strongly and with feehng  through almost a parody of conventional  ballet. The choreography was intriguing and  fun to watch. This was the best of the dance  pieces.  Clowns Hold Up Half the Sky  Theatre Energy from Nelson was hilarious,  original and exuberant in Clowns Hold  Up Half the Sky. They "explored female  stereotypes and archetypes" through a series of vignettes and sMts that ranged from  outrageously satirical to touching. Nothing  was safe: angels were first up—it was only  a matter of time until the madonna got it.  My favorite piece was "The Waiter and the  Lady" where an abusive waiter and a vindictive customer try to best one another  in strange ways. "The Doctor" attempting  self-examination was obviously a hit with  the woman in front of me; she was crying with laughter. The expressiveness of the  cast in everything from broad parody to  silent mime was a joy to watch. No character was out of place. The images throughout showed strongly the absurdity of the  many female stereotypes and archetypes  we're constantly exposed to.  Y. V.R.  Single Mindedness  Marlane O'Brien has a great voice and  the right kind of sassiness and vulnerability for tMs character. The production was  slick, witty and entertaining with catchy  tunes cleverly linked together. The subject  was the old stereotype of the lonely woman,  "single, female and surrounded by image of  happy-coupledness," struggling to make hfe  without a man meamngful. And a tough job  it is, involving everything from what she  looks hke to where she hves.  "A Man Wants to Know ..." was the  least successful song. It's the typical male's  lament, wondering what today's woman really wants. How can he be expected to buy  flowers for a woman who knows how to fix  her own car? How can he find the happy  medium between being the strong silent  type and the sensitive sharing type? That  was the one problem with tMs show: it was  just about types.  Y.V.R.  by Bonnie Waterstone  Cargo of Crinolines  Cargo of Crinolines, a reading, combined women's herstory and futuristic vision in an ambitious script by Barbara Kar-  mazyn and Gina Stockdale.  The play begins with the one male ac-  I tor reading from an actual speech given by  f the Bishop of Oxford to the Columbia Mis-  ; sion Society in London in 1861. The Bishop  '<■ pompously pleads support for an immigration scheme to sMp "excess" females from  Britain to British Columbia, where white  women are needed to provide a "healing  blessing" to British men in the gold fields.  The action begins in the steerage of a  sMp bound for British Columbia in 1862,  with the cast of five women, three bible-  reading, two card-playing, bickering together. Through the lively dialogue, the audience learns that these women are headed  to an unknown land because "there's no  place for us back there," that they're  kept in steerage for 90 days, and that  during the passage they're given lessons  in deportment. They are young women,  women from workhouses, prostitutes, or  unemployed governesses—women without  the protection of a man, women the state  doesn't want. They are not told they're be-  Theatre Energy  ing sMpped to B.C. for the men. They believe they're going to a land of new opportunity.  The scene changes from the past to the  future. The five women are still "imprisoned" together, only tMs time they are in  the "Green Section" of a huge breeding centre. They are all surrogate mothers, numbers 981, 982, 983, 984 and 985. Once again  they aren't aware how they're being used.  They believe they are helping the "childless  couple crisis" or that tMs is the best (only?)  job they can get.  The action leaps from past to future to  past to future again. It is to the credit  of tMs fascinating script that the audience  listening in the present, easily fills in the  gap. The parallels between excess females  sMpped to the colony of B.C. and breeders  for the state of the not too distant future  are clear. Women, defined by men for men,  are suitable for two functions: marriage and  motherhood.  As a staged reading, the performance had  some flaws. It will be much more interesting as a full scale production, wMch Barbara  Karmazyn says is planned for tMs spring.  Mavis Tells the Story of  Marlene and the Chicken Yard  When Nora Randall was on stage, it was  time to sit back, get comfortable, and let  the words of Mavis Tells the Story of  Marlene and the Chicken Yard roll on  over you. Within a few sentences, Randall  had the audience chuckling and laugMng  and waiting for what was next. Sitting down  with Mavis is hke sitting down in your own  Mtchen, or maybe your sister's or your best  friend's Mtchen.  Marlene is Mavis' sister and the story  Mavis tells is about two women who know  each other very well, who love each other,  and who get exasperated and hurt and upset  with each other. Mavis and Marlene drive  school buses. They've been driving buses  for years. The bane of their existence  the tiny yard, right next to a poultry processing plant, in wMch all the buses have  to park. When Marlene is promoted to assistant manager, the sisters' solidarity is  shaken.  Story telling is performance art, very different from reading a story to an audience.  Randall occasionally falls into the reading  mode, losing the character of Mavis and becoming the author saying Mavis' words instead. This hardly hinders the audience's  enjoyment, however. The words are colourful, creating visual images as clear as the  sMny red sweatsMrt Randall wears.  Randall is not afraid to repeat, to say the  same tMng several ways. She has a comic's  sense of timing, that emphatic pause, as she  leans over and lets you in on the gossip.  She speaks especially to women, as when  Mavis visits Marlene's house and finds those  "international distress signals:" a spotlessly  clean oven, freshly fined cupboard shelves,  and all her spices in alphabetical order. But  who can foretell wMch sister will become the  worMng class heroine of the chicken yard?  JacMe Crossland, director of Mavis  Tells ..., is booMng Mavis through Random Acts Productions. H you missed it at  Women In View, you may have another  chance for a guaranteed good laugh with  Nora Randall.  B.W.  One view of the rapt audience  .KINESIS  KINESIS  Feb. 89 17 .^?^^5S^^^^^^^5^;^5^^^^^^^^^^^  Arts  Barbara Smith: Truths echoing myths  by Eunice Brooks  She has chosen the name Corn Woman,  person of the Earth. Of course, she knows of  the labels that stick to her such as: Cherokee, student, educator, novelist, anthropologist, healer, counsellor, disabled mother,  and even philosopher. She has lived in many  places, but she is presently centered in Victoria That's where I interviewed Barbara  Smith, and where she showed me her home,  and some of her favorite places including a  shop that sells wiccan products.  We met first within the context of a  healing, at Squamish last March, at the  DAWN B.C. Disabled Women's Network  Conference. Barbara, a mother is one of the  founders of DAWN. She was taMng a summer course at the University of British Columbia in the summer of 1985, when she was  asked to represent Native issues at a Secretary of State meeting called to bring attention to issues important to disabled women  such as isolation, difficulty in mothering,  shortcomings in fife sMlls, inadequate education and others. At the time she was working in Yellowkmfe, as a teacher of nutrition,  drug and alcohol awareness and parenting  sMlls.  Her first two novels, in the Renewal Series, The Prophecy of Manu, and Teoni's  Give Away are available in local women's  stores, and the tMrd book, From the Moon  Lodge will be released next September. Her  fiction tells of the Anisom people, who live  in perfect harmony with their world. These  people are the keepers of the Medicine.  She tells me that the stories came to her  in dreams—for years—before it dawned on  her to write them down. Barbara is much  like one of her own characters, believing  that spiritual growth comes slowly, through  prayer and a desire for change. Life and  death have perfect balance in her fiction.  photos by Eunice Brooks  "It wasn't so much that I'm almost blind  that I didn't sit down to write," she says,  in a voice that is both qmet and vibrant. "I  was a widow with three sons to raise and  I had a demanding job. At the same time  I was investigating the truths in myths of  people who follow the old ways. Maybe I  didn't know than how much I was capable  of doing."  Barbara's mother taught her to fight to  get all the education available, and not to  settle for second best. When Barbara was 18  and away at college, her mother died. They  had had a good relationsMp and she tMnks  Mndly of her childhood now. Her family  practiced traditional Christianity^ but Barbara found her interest pulled to the teach  ings of the grandmothers, when the family  visited reserves. In Cumberland, Tennessee  she first learned herb lore, and is still seeking knowledge of natural medicines.  It was in the 70's, in the political uproar of native revival, when she was hving in  a back-tc-the-land commune that her husband died. Even then she was searching for  universality, rather than tribalism. "I'm a  citizen of the world!" she states, in a tone  that asks for no argument. When I asked her  how she manages to get around to so many  places, she says, "inner sight," no smile.  She dabbled in politics long enough to realize it wasn't where she could be of most  value. Politics and labels go together, and  she doesn't like labels. She lives, nowadays,  with a quiet acceptance of tMngs that cannot be changed, and a determination to  make the best of tMngs changeable. This  is also the way of hfe for the central character in her fiction: Teom. Teoni has the  Medicine.  A book, Seven Arrows, by Hyemey-  ohsts, was a strong road sign for Barbara  From her tall shelf she lifts the book, now  showing its age, and reads aloud: "To touch  and feel, is to experience. Many people hve  out their lives, without ever really touching,  or being touched by anything."  Reading about wiccan hfe, rituals, and  women's spirit in Starhawk's books focused  Barbara's inner sight. (Starhawk is a well  known femimst witch and writer.) Meditations, assertions, healing music, New Age  teaching, became her hfe. She learned to  deal with her anger, with her short comings. Rituals helped. It was the beginmng  of her healing. A new energy lifted her. "I  wanted to give something back to Starhawk,  so I mailed her a letter and one of my paintings. (Barbara paints as a hobby.) She sent  me back a scholarsMp to come down to her  place and study. I went. We still keep in  touch."  I notice that she doesn't preach. She tells  me about her growth, without indicating I  should grow the same way. "I know what  I've experienced," she says. We talk about  changes in women in recorded history. She  says that women at one time held all the  wisdom, but in today's patriarchal society we are almost powerless. She says that  poor women, with children, hve at society's  mercy.  Mothering, Barbara says, is sometmng  children either allow or not. If a child removes permission to parent, there is nothing  a mother can do. The label of bad mother  is the most shameful in our society.  When a woman has four sons, and is almost blind, she occasionally has to ask for  help. The only help left to women is the system. Barbara has requested a short time of  respite care, and for a housekeeper in the future. Now, will the system remove her children from her care, or will they do what has  to be done for the good of the family?  Jessie, her son who has been on and off  her lap while we talk, is seven. He has both  learning and behavioural problems and demands constant care. Loving him, she accepts tMs. Clearly he loves her also, but  he has not learned that she cannot always  cope with Mm. The question of what is best  for both Jessie and herself is as yet unanswered. If Jessie was a fictional character, I  ask, what would the Anishoni, her fictional  people, do with him?  In her fiction, Teoni also has a special  child, and Teoni has to give over the care  of her child, Shona, to the elders. Shona  is educated and yet still within the nurturing of Teoni. There is help for an Anishoni  mom who needs it within the community.  People look for the good in a special child,  not the bad. In the novels there are women  who go out to hunt, wise women who keep  the Medicine, and other mothers who make  meals ready for those who have been out on  watch. But, in the fiction, all the people are  Barbara Smith considers herself a citizen  equal, all Ufe is valued. The Anishoni do not  kill, except for food, and then they ask the  ammal to give up its fife voluntarily so they  can live.  Barbara demands help from the system,  and she counsels other women who need  help to demand it. "It was the patriarchal  system that took away the power of women,  and now that same patriarchal system will  have to be responsible for our powerlessness." Barbara needs a housekeeper, and  she knows that without special education,  Jessie could suffer. "Disabled parents have  special needs that able bodied social workers fail to recogmze," she tells me.  That brings us back to our common interest, DAWN B.C., and the upcoming conference on family hfe. "One of the tMngs I want  to research is the difference in attitudes that  children have toward the disabilities that  their mothers have." She tells me that she  has already begun compiling information.  The conference will be a place of meeting  for disabled mothers, and much knowledge  can be pooled. DAWN is a women's network  where individual stories are validated, that  strives to ensure that each woman holds the  same status. The DAWN philosophy hasn't  qmte reached that of the fictional Anishoni,  but the group is heading in the right direction. Barbara sees the group as a communication network, knowledge and wisdom in  the circle.  Some people won't ever accept her belief  of the goddess within. To me she says: "All  we need is in here," she pats a belly almost  as round as the tiny goddess rephca she has  in her soft hand. "I don't tMnk women must  of the world.  be Amazons—as some myths portray—just  people who do what has to be done, as well  as they can." Barbara hkes herself, without  flaunting, without gaudy decoration, and  without shame.  She tells me that we, all of us hving today, need wisdom if we are to survive as a  species. Teoni, in her fiction, has the wisdom that brings the ecosystem back to good  health. I ask her if she tMnks women will  have to save the world. She smirks: "It's a  dirty job, but someone has to do it." This  is the closest she has come to making a joke  all day, and I relax with her. It's dark in the  room now, and I've stopped taking notes.  Barbara sits with the tiny goddess in  hand. Her serenity seems to sMne hke an  aura. I know I'm imagining it, but I want  to hold that memory. I have noticed a wall  hanging in another room. I ask her if she  also weaves. She brings out her loom. Barbara weaves in many ways too. She weaves  her truths into her fiction, and her everyday life as well. She creates not only children, but stories, paintings, tapestry, music  and wellbeing.  As I leave the house I trip over a tree  trunk. I remember that Barbara walks in  the constant dark of blindness. She trusts  her inner vision. What was it she said as I  was leaving?  "Eunice, we are not just being—we're becoming."  .KINESIS Arts  /////////////////////^^^^^  .» iaaxis-^  ^xtare-  WOMAN  DEBEL  giSSS; » -^*, .j» race «iJW 3aCaru dafc        ^  «  3SSSSS Dr?cai. »?oafrttta3l !«•!*«»    ^  ia<  No gods, no masters  by Michele Valiquette  In May 1970 I turned 18, graduated  from Mgfi school ... and got pregnant.  That same month the fledgling Canadian  women's movement organized one of its  first public actions. An Abortion Caravan  left Vancouver for Ottawa, and was greeted  along the way by rallies and demonstrations where women from across the country added their voices to the demand for  legalized abortion. Ii. the capital, Caravan  members drew on the tactics of turn-of-  the-century suffragists: 36 women chained  themselves to the chairs in the visitors'  gallery and forced parliament to listen to  their message.  Meanwhile, I traded university plans for  marriage and motherhood. It was a few  years before I caught up with the movement, but when I did the significance of  choice and of reproductive rights was crystal clear to me, and to thousands of other  Canadian women.  This month, my daughter will turn  18. After almost two decades of feminist  struggle, choice is closer to being a reality for her. Section 251 of the Criminal  Code was struck down a year ago, and  it's been several months now since Everywoman's Health Centre—Vancouver's first  free-standing abortion clinic—opened its  doors. Both are monumental victories. But  with the federal government threatening to  introduce new laws restricting availability of  abortion and with anti-choice groups continuing their campaign of harassment, it'll  take more hard work, and the combined efforts of two generations of femimsts, to hold  on to these gains. So I tell my daughter  about my situation in 1970 and about the  Abortion Caravan—because I want her to  enter the struggle inspired by a sense of its  history.  The events of the early seventies are documented in the pages of The Pedestal,  forerunner of Kinesis. And recently I came  across a fascinating periodical from an earlier wave of femimst organizing that adds  still another dimension to our understanding of the work we are building on: Margaret Sanger's Woman Rebel.  Sanger was an obstetrical nurse and in  the years just prior to the first world  war she assisted in home births on New  York's poverty-stricken lower eastside. In  the course of her work she witnessed the  extreme hardsMp—physical, emotional and  financial—that successive unwanted pregnancies forced on women. And, she faced  one desperate woman after another, who  begged her to tell the "secret" of contraception.  But Sanger didn't know tMs "secret" and  even if she had she'd have been prevented—  officially at least—from passing it on. Federal legislation made it a crime to import or  to distribute not only contraceptive drugs  or devices but information about them.  Similar laws prevailed in both Canada and  Great Britain.  Inspired by Emma Goldman's speeches  about voluntary parenthood, and not one to  be daunted by the regulations of the state,  Sanger gradually resolved to take action.  In October 1913 she went to France where  she'd heard she could find practical details  of birth control techniques. Two months  later she returned to the States, armed with  concrete information and determined that  it should be made available to the women  who needed it.  And that's where the Woman Rebel  came in. From the first issue in March of  1914 through to the last in October of the  same year, the fiery journal refused to pull  any punches. The spirit of the opening editorial is typical of the entire run.  Here Sanger decried the state of sexual  ignorance young women were kept in and  asserted their right to knowledge and pleasure. She scoffed at the double standard  that allowed a man to enter into a sexual relationsMp with a woman only to turn  around and denounce her for it. She rejected the fallacy of the "wayward woman"  and asserted that prostitution was a social  and economic issue—not a moral one. And  she called upon women to "tMnk for themselves," to "build up a conscious fighting  character."  In each of the seven issues of Woman  Rebel, birth control—a phrase Sanger  coined—was examined in the same broad  context. Contributors stripped marriage  and motherhood of the romantic myths  surrounding them and got at the abysmal  poverty of many large families and the degeneracy of an institution that put a woman  in a slave relationship to her husband. Without access to contraception, they argued,  companionate marriage was impossible.  More than one article accused the state of  encouraging large families for its own ends:  to provide soldiers for its "war machine"  and cheap labour for its factories. Often,  discussions of women's worMng conditions  and the philosophy of family planmng ran  side by side. The first issue included the International Workers of the World preamble  calling for abolition of the wage system.  Explicit directions for preventing conception did not appear in the Woman  Rebel's pages but boxed notices throughout advised readers of booMets that could  be obtained for a low price: "What Every  Girl Should Know," "What Every Mother  Should Know." Readers were encouraged  to organize regional Malthus—or planned  parenthood—leagues. Their letters are revealing:  "Woman Rebel:  Enclosed find ten cents, for information on how to prevent conception. If  you cannot send it to me on account  of the Post Office please send me the  names of some books where I can find  it. I am nearly crazy with worry from  month to month.  Mother of Four,  Eureka, Calif."  Sanger's editorial in Number 4 expressed  the conviction that rang through every issue of the Woman Rebel:  "A woman's body belongs to herself  alone. It is her body. It does not belong to  the Church. It does not belong to the United  States of America or to any other government on the face of the earth ... Enforced  motherhood is the most complete demal of  a woman's right to fife and liberty."  Sanger had set out dehberately to challenge the law. And the authorities were  quick to respond. Following the first number of the journal she received a letter from  the Postmaster General advising her that  the Woman Rebel was unmailable under  the Criminal Code. That earned him a defiant notice in the Number 2: "The Woman  Rebel feels proud the Post Office Authorities did not approve of her. She shall blush  with shame if ever she be approved by officialism ..."  Sanger managed to put out seven issues of the Woman Rebel in all before  she was indicted for producing a pamphlet  "of obscene, lewd and lascivious character."  Among the articles the court found offensive  were "Can You Afford to Have a Large Family?" and "Are Preventative Means Injurious?" Also cited was one straightforward  call for safe, legal abortion. Less surprising,  perhaps, is the court's objection to "A Defense of Assassination" from the July issue.  On the eve of her trial Sanger fled to  Canada and from there to England. The  Woman Rebel never re-emerged. But three  days after her hurried departure she sent  a cable instructing supporters to release a  pamphlet she'd written, had printed and  secretly stored not long before. With tMs  signal 100,000 addressed copies of Family  Limitation, a compilation of the information she'd gathered in France, flooded into  the United States mail.  The Woman Rebel is available on microform in the University of British  Columbia library. And the New York  Archives of Social History reprinted  the journal's full run in a 1976 volume of the same name edited by Alex  Baskin. Watch Baskin's introduction,  though. While lauding Sanger's lifelong  battle for birth control, he chastises her  for leaving her husband, "neglecting"  her children and espousing "immature"  left-wing politics.

In B.C.  many areas are being proposed as provincial  parks but a B.C. Parks classification doesn't  necessarily mean that the area will be safe  from exploitation. One of the major reasons  why a parks designation is not a guarantee  of safety for the natural environment is our  own love of nature and the explosion of outdoor recreation pastimes.  The provincial parks are governed by the  Parks Act and a mandate. The mandate has  a dual purpose to support both recreation  and conservation. In the federal park system it is clearly specified that any conflict  of interest between recreation and conservation will be settled in conservation's favour.  There is no such provision in the B.C.  Parks' mandate which means that recreation interests can take precedence over  conservation.  In 1988 the Parks Branch published  "StriMng the Balance—B.C. Parks Policy"  (available from B.C. Parks, 4000 Seymour  Place, Victoria, B.C.). Its aim was to make  public their overall commitment to park  management. In it there is an attempt to  address the inconsistencies in the park mandate and park classifications.  Basically there are two main park classifications: Class A parks wMch are dedicated to the recreational enjoyment of all  and Recreation Areas which have resource  commitments within their boundaries (eg.  mines). One section of "StriMng the Balance" describes the different types of "park  zones," designating park areas for pure conservation, wilderness experiences, natural  environment activities, intensive recreation  and integrated resource areas. It appears  that areas can be protected under these  classifications but, in truth the zones are  only management objectives and can be altered at any time by government.  The Ecological Reserves program, managed by B.C. Parks, is a fairly secure classification for conservation but even here we  humans have been having an impact because of our "love" of the environment. A  good example is at the Robson Bight ecological reserve where commercial whale watching ventures are reportedly beginmng to disrupt the very whales the area was set aside  to protect.  The bottom hne in all tMs is that the government of the day has the power to decide  in any conflict and can let short term interests outweigh long term management goals  if it so chooses. As tourism in the province  increases so do the demands for recreation  opportunities in the provincial parks and we  all know that money does have a tendency  to talk.  Compounding all the confusion around  the mandate is the onslaught of privatization (alias contracting out). Beginning in  the 1980's the provincial park system began  to undergo profound changes. Some of the  first "privatization" initiatives by the Bennett government were enacted in provincial parks. In 1983, for example, the sM  "Women are losing their  livelihoods, their savings  their health, their self-  esteem, their children, and  sometimes their lives, in  custody battles with men."  VANCOUVER STATUS OF WOMEN  SPONSORS  AN EVENING ON  CHILD CUSTODY  WITH GUEST SPEAKER  SUSAN CREAN  author of  IfiTHE  MM  OF THE  MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27  7:30 PM  AT LA QUENA  1111 COMMERCIAL DRIVE  $2 DONATION  CHILDCARE REIMBURSED  ' CALL 255-5511   for information .  hills located in Manning, Cypress and Seymour provincial parks were transferred from  government ownership to private long term  leases as park concessions.  A park concession is a private business  operating inside of a park. It must conform  to the Park Act or apply for park use permits to contravene any part of it. It is considered autonomous from the rest of the  park. There are also park contractors working in the parks but these work for the  parks branch directly. A provision has been  made in the Park Act for concessions so that  can run sM hills, rent canoes, etc.  Class C Park  (0.02 million hectares)  Nearly all park lands fit within 2 classifications.  The problems arise when recreation interests promoted by the general public or  private business ventures clash with sound  ecological planmng. How many sM runs are  too many sM runs? Does hehcopter sMing  disrupt wildlife in remote areas? What's the  impact of one in every ten people stepping  off the trail in a fragile subalpine habitat?  How many seashells can be collected before  the beach begins to erode? Each develop  ment in a park impacts that ecosystem. It  is not a question of "Does our presence impact the environment?" It is a question of  how much. And, can we sustain the balance  that allows us to co-exist in an area pursuing our hobbies?  The park system needs unbiased staff, secure in their jobs, who feel safe making decisions that may counter any particular lobby  group bent. The current Social Credit government has stated that it would hke to contract out all provincial government employees or have them on part time status within  the next ten years. Any concerned person  must ask, who will be left in park management who feels secure enough to manage a  park properly without fear of reprisals for  an unpopular but sound decision?  The one element in tMs picture that is  free of government adjustments is the general public. Public watchdogs are needed  now more than ever. Currently, outside interest groups monitor B.C. parks from Wells  Grey to Fort Steele. Many of them call  themselves Friends of... (the most famous  of these being Friends of Strathcona), others  are just small groups of concerned persons  who keep in touch with the park and its decision makers. Some do volunteer trail work,  others do flora and fauna studies, most just  explore and relax there. They all know the  park well and so they are available for public input and action when conflicts of interest arise.  This is a tumultuous time for any piece  of the earth.

We  launch tMs campaign to forestall the myths  often associated with some of those cultural  practices in order to induce women to refrain from them. Some societies believe that  if the clitoris is not excised it will harm the  male organ during intercourse. Others believe that if the clitoris touches the baby's  head the baby will die. Just de-mystifying  or giving information can contribute a lot  to change these ideas.  Moreover, the campaign was prompted  by the fact that unlike Europe and America where AIDS has occurred mostly in homosexual men, the opposite is the case in  Africa where women are noted carriers. In  addition, it is the sexual aspects of AIDS  that has riveted public attention over the  disease and it is not without good cause, but  in Africa recent research has shown the sexual aspects coupled with female genital mutilation is the cause of the present spread of  AIDS.  Uli Linke of the University of Califorma,  Berkeley, has associated the spread of the  disease in sub-Saharan and Central Africa  countries to the practice. She said in a letter  to the professional Science journal in January 1986: "infibulation is associated not  only with chronic pain, but with lesions in  the vaginal tissue and bleeding leading to  the presence of blood during intercourse. In  some cases full penetration can take up to  nine months during wMch time anal intercourse is a common alternative. It is noteworthy that the recent outbreak of AIDS in  Africa corresponds geographically to those  regions in which female genital mutilation  is still pronounced."  We have also attested to tMs fact, for  since the mutilation is performed with special unsterilized kmves and blades often  gummed with strata of blood victims, the  AIDS virus is easily transmitted from one  woman to another.  Since the launching of tMs educational  campaign two years ago, we have met with  failures and successes. Some traditionalists  have labelled us traitors to our own people for exposing the shameful practices of  women to the pubHc. Government agencies  have considered the subject too sensitive  to assist the educational programme with  funding and we have therefore been thrown  into serious financial difficulties and were  forced to cut our budget by 49 percent.  Nevertheless, our gains during the period  have been very rewarding and encouraging.  Our field workers have covered over 150,000  square kilometers of our sub-continent and  have met with seven million rural women  and school girls to dissuade them from the  practice.  As we mark tMs occasion, tMs educational programme is being launched in  The Repubhc of Equatorial Guinea, Central  Africa, for the rural women of that region.  This is another milestone in our struggle for  freedom from age-long traditional and cultural practices which have become instruments of oppression; and another bold step  in fulfilling our ultimate aim of maMng tMs  programme a continental one.  I wish on my behalf and that of women  here to express our sincere gratitude to you  for your moral and financial support to the  programmes of our centre through wMch we  were able to make such gains. We earnestly  appeal to you for your continuous support  as our task is such that it cannot be accomplished overnight. As a non-governmental  women's organization we depend mostly on  donations from our friends and supporters  for the runmng of our programmes and services, our success so far is made possible by  your support.  Once again, thank you for your support  and solidarity in these difficult times of our  struggle. We believe that many little steps  of many little people can change the face of  the world.

In Sisterhood,  Hannah Edemikpong  (Women's Contact Person)  Thinking  white  Kinesis:  Faith Nolan smiling at us from the pages  of Kinesis makes it clear that women  of colour singer songwriters exist. Why  were they not included in the book Born  a Woman reviewed in the December/  January issue of Kinesisl There is an interview by Sadie Kuehn with singer songwriter  Faith Nolan, a Canadian black woman.  On the same page there is a book review by Louise Allen of Ellen Schwartz'  book Born a Woman: Seven Canadian  Singer Songwriters. There is no mention  that all seven singer songwriters are white.  Did Ellen Schwartz decide consciously to  write about wMte women exclusively? Did  Louise Allen notice that it was a book about  white women? I tliink not. If they did,  why did Louise Allen fail to mention it?  Louise Allen wrote: "We're given a variety  of women whose talent spans three decades  creating an appreciation for the historical growth of women's music" (emphasis  mine).  they call pay equity "sex pay"  they say "rape is not rape"  they want child custody  ..MEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS  If you are alarmed by men's rights  activists and the feminist backlash  JOIN THE FAMILY POLITICS GROUP  a working committee of  Vancouver Status of Women  call 255-5511 for information  WMte women's music does not equal a  variety of women's music. Nor does it by  itself give us a Mstory of the growth of  women's music. Schwartz and Allen make  the same mistake most of us wMte people  make. We tMnk wMte, we act wMte, and we  assume that if it is wMte it represents humanity.  It is important for wMte women to know  about white women's history. But wMte  women must not make the mistake of assuming that it is the history of all women.  As Faith Nolan said, "The problem with  femimsm is that the people with the resources to put out what they have to say  have been predominantly white middle class  women. They only talked about issues that  were important to them—tmnMng they  were able to speak knowingly on issues of  all women, across race and class hnes."  Dorrie Brannock  Keremos  kudos  Kinesis:  As chrome mystery readers and Helen  Keremos fans, we'd like to take issue with  your recent review of Beyond Hope by  Eve Zaremba. We realize hterary criticism is  sacrosanct, and we won't argue with the reviewer's right to hate a book. But we tMnk  Kinesis readers should give Beyond Hope  a second look. Read it and judge for yourselves.  Yes the plot is fuzzy. By the end of the  book it's hard to tell who is chasing whom  and why. And some of the characters are  one-dimensional. That's OK by us. Lots of  real people are that way too. And as far as  Ms. Keremos is concerned, we love the way  she talks in cliches and manages to get in  and out of ridiculous scrapes with a shrug  and a chucMe. This is dyke dick stuff after all, not Great Feminist Literature. Over  the course of only three books, Ms. Zaremba  has managed to create a lesbian folk heroine with a very complex and endearing personality. She's tough and funny and almost  invincible, with a heart of gold. What more  can a mystery fan ask for? She's a modern Beebo Brinker with a Canadian flavour.  She's Philip Marlowe in drag. She's the first  dame WE'D call if the bad guys were after  us!  Bravo, Eve. And let's have more of Helen  Keremos.  Judith Quinlan and Jacqueline Frewin  Thinking  english  Kinesis:  In "Learning to ride sometMng dangerous ... " Jeannie Lochrie brings up the  very real conflict between ecriture femimne  and concrete action. The near hieroglyphics produced by tMs form of expression are  a graphic representation of the traps laid  within language, and by extension, culture.  Ecriture femimne means something to me  because I've been through university and  exposed to it and the structures it is based  on. H not, I would probably easily dismiss it  all as mental gymnastics. As it is, the conflict, for me, exists in being able to appreciate much of it as an interesting intellectual  exercise, but not beyond that into pohtical  practice.  Jeannie Lochrie asks 'how do we share  our discoveries' yet the questions are posed  in one direction: how do 'hterary sisters'  share with others (those that are perhaps  less fortunate?) The concept of 'sharing'  doesn't seem to extend in the other direction.  More importantly, I have real trouble  with Jeannie Lochrie stretcMng the issue of  accessibihty into the realm of french/engfish  language pohtics. Spending three or four  years in university to learn a structure to  expose/subvert it is a luxury and privilege  for a few women, clearly not available for  all. (f.)Lip (and Kinesis, for that matter)  both emerge from a bilingual country and  commumcating with millions of its inhabitants should not be put on the same level.  Being able to understand any language  but that of the ruling majority is not a position to defend. Instead of being concerned  with the 'elitism' of not translating a few  quotes into english, I am offended by the  imperialism of demanding that all words be  translated into the ruling tongue. Nowhere  is it suggested that the rest of (f.)Lip's text  be translated into french. Are francophone  women expected to understand english? Or  are the costs involved reason enough to dismiss the possibihty without mention?  Maybe it's unreasonable for me to expect  west coast women to have easy access to  french courses. But it is not unreasonable  to expect these same women to address tMs  gap; instead of expecting others to continue  to account for it.  Language is indeed power. Before we leap  into how intellectual variations can n  into revolution, we should take the first  steps toward ensuring that we all understand each other.  Karen Herland  Montreal, Quebec  Farewell  Kinesis:  We are announcing that Dykes for Dykedom will no longer be in existence after  November 23rd, 1988.  We appreciate everyone who has supported, struggled and worked with us over  the past three years. We are proud of the  work that we have done in the lesbian, gay,  womyn's and other communities. We are  also appreciative of all that we have learned  while doing tMs work in alliance with others.  All of us look forward to continued exciting and radical political activity in Vancouver and elsewhere.  In Solidarity,  Dykes for Dykedom  Facts  questioned  Kinesis:  Thanks for telling us the sMl saw was invented by a woman. Now, for those of us  who qmckly turned to page nine to find out  what her name was—please let us know!  My friend George, an electrician who is  very welcoming of the idea of women in the  trades, is very curious as to who tMs woman  inventor was or is. Apart from that: interesting article. It was nice to see a picture of  Kate Braid looMng well and happy. (I used  to know her years ago when she was taking a  framing course.) At my volunteer job at the  Sunshine Coast Action Centre we get copies  of "On the Level," a newsletter for carpenters, and I am very impressed by their (on  the whole) nonsexist editorial pohcy.  As a Green Party member I enjoyed the  group of articles on ecofeminism and the  environment. I'd welcome more on ecofeminism in future issues. Keep up the good  work in 1989.  In Sisterhood,  Anne Miles  Editor's Note: Kate Braid tells us she  saw a reference in Tradeswomen magazine, a U.S. publication, that a Shaker  woman, Amy Babitt was the saw's inventor. We have been unable to contact  Tradeswomen to confirm or expand on  this information.
