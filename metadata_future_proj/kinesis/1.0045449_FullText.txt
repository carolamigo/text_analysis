Af6-  To date of the 122 recommendations of  the Royal Commission Report on the  Status of Women in Canada which fall  within the federal jurisdiction  approximately one third (42) have  been implemented. Another one third  (37) have been partially implemented.  Unfortunately, however, the greatest  number (43) have yet to provoke  governmental action.  The VSW is pledged to remedy this  state of affiars, but a staff of  seven and an executive of sixteen  simply cannot do it all. We need  you!  What can you do? Well, it's not  very exciting or novel, but it is  crucial - WRITE LETTERS!  Who should you write?  1. The MP for your area.  If you're not sure who  that is, call us (736-  3746) or Information  Canada (666-3841).  2. Marc Lalonde  Minister in Charge of the  Status of Women  3. The Minister under whose  jurisdiction that particular  recommendation or set of  recommendations fall. Again,  call us or Info Canada about  who that is.  4. The Prime Minister  5. The Advisory Council on the  Status of Women, 63 Sparks St.,  Box 1541, Station B, Ottawa,  Ont. KIP 5R5, would appreciate  copies of letters you direct  to the above parties. More  grist for the mill!  As a regular feature KINESIS will  focus on a set of recommendations  that have yet to be acted on and  give you the name of the minister  under whose jurisdiction those  recommendations fall. After that  the rest is up to you.  This month the spotlight falls on  discriminatory aspects of the  Citizenship. Act. The Secretary of  State, Hugh Faulkner, is the minister  on the spot.  Rec.  145  That the Canadian Citizenship  Act be amended to provide for  the automatic resumption of  Canadian Citizenship by women  who lost it because they married aliens before January 1st,  1947.  ,  That the CCA be amended so that  there is no difference between  the residence requirements for  the acquisition of Canadian  Citizenship by an alien husband  and an alien wife of a Canadian  Citizen. (At present alien wives  of Canadians must wait one year,  husbands five years.)  That sections 4 & 5 of the CCA  be amended to provide that a  child born outside Canada is  a natural born Canadian if  either of his parents is a  Canadian citizen.  (In such a  case a Canadian woman cannot  confer her citizenship on her  child.  148 Tnat the CCA be amended so that  either citizen parent may apply  for naturalized citizenship of  a minor child. (At present  mothers may not do so unless  the father is dead or she has  custody.  149 That the CCA be amended so that  in the case of -i^int adoption  the child may b granted Canadian citizenship if either of.  the adopting parents is a  Canadian citizen. Orientation for October Thursday , Oct. 10, open meeting.  Thursday, Oct. 24, speaker will  be Lee Grills, formerly of  N.O.W. Anyone is welcome to  come along to the office at  2029 West 4th at 8 pm and join  in on those meetings.  LETTER ACTION  The letter action group had its  first meeting on Sept. 11.  So  far we have 7 keen letter  writers in action, each having  decided which area they wanted  to research and write letters  about. We need more people to  help out though. This is an  ideal action area for those of  you who can't get down to the  office for many meetings because you can do this work in  the comfort of your own home!  Just call Diana at the office or  Dorothy Holmes at 936-1662 and  we will fill you in on what  has happened so far. We will  also send you the basic information pakcage you need to get  going.  The next issue of  Kinesis will have an article  and accompanying letter by our  group, meanwhile please read  and digest the article on  Citizenship by Roberta Schlos-  berg and act on her suggestions  re letter writing.  IS THERE  I noticed something funny.  Media Action Group will be  meeting once a month only from  now on. Next meeting Tuesday,  October 15 at 7:30 in the office.  A lot of you express anger at  the ads you see when you call  the office. How about coming  to a meeting? Only one new  person showed up to the last  one in September. Tsk tsk.  but the malady lingers  Parent Pressure Group we have  received the grand total of  two (count 'em) calls re the  need to form a Parent Pressure  Group. We need more. Read  the notice on page 5 of the  September Kinesis and if it  affects you please call and  sign up.  .JNGONAT  THE OFFICE  YOU DON'T  KNOW  ABOUT?  Renee Van Halm, our artist on  the Summer Student Program, has  produced a marvellous array of  public relations material for  us. Articles include a package  of 8 black/white graphic postcards with a feminist theme.  The cards come in a cleverly  designed display envelope and  sells for $1 a package (plus tax).  There are also six different  posters now available. Titles  are "My Body Myself", "Super  Ombudswoman", "Sisterhood is  Powerful", "All Over The World  Girls Are Growing Up", "This  Gallery Is Closed", and"Husbands  Are Not Bosses, Children Are Not  Jobs". They are presently on  display in the office and we will  get photos into next month's  newsletter. They cost $1 each,  plus tax.  We printed 15 dozen t-shirts  and sold all but 2 dozen in the  first 3 weeks! The only ones  left are white with gold lettering  saying "Status of Women". They  come in small, med, and large and  are quite a large cut. As soon  as Renee gets some free time from  her art studies we will silk-  screen more.  Sold out titles  included "Women Unite", "Uppity  Women Unite", "Sexism Is A Social  Disease", and "Sister". They  cost $3 each plux tax.  We don't expect to have the full  selection of t-shirts available  until early November (just in time  for your Xmas shopping!) but the  posters and postcards are ready  and waiting.  Come,to the office  to buy—we are open Mon-Fri, 9-5.  *0ut of town customers please  *hold your orders until the next  newsletter when we will have  complete info on mail order  costs.  COMMUNICATION SKILLS  We are Master's students at UBC  in the Department of Counselling  Psychology. This fall we will be  conducting a six week workshop  in DEVELOPING COMMUNICATION SKILLS  We have chosen to conduct this  workshop because of our belief  that since women are exploring  new ways of being, generally,  they might well consider the  fact that expressing .themselves skillfully within relationships deserves some special  attention.  Our purpose then, is to provide  a time for all of us to wsrk  towards accurate self expression.  We will discover that the gap  which may exist between the way  we see ourselves in interactions  and the way others see us, can  be narrowed with each other's  help^  Meetings will be every Monday  evening at 7:30 pm beginning  October 21 at the Status of  Women office, 2029 West 4th Ave.  For more information call  Diana Bissell, 736-3746, Sandra  Yasin, 688-6505 or Diane  Waterman, 733-5164.  See you thereI.  Speaking engagements we are  rapidly being inundated with  calls to speak to high schools,  women's groups etc. We are more  than willing to do as many as  we can and if any of you know  of groups that need a good  dose of feminist enthusiasm  please suggest us to them!  ALSO, we sure could use the  help of any members who would  like to join us on these jaunts.  We always try to go out in  pairs so don't be afraid of  having to do it on your own.  If you are keen on expressing  your own feelings about the  Women's Movement and the Status  of Women to other people, and  are available the occasional  evening or afternoon to go  out with one of the office  staff to a speaking engagement,  please call the office and ask  for Diana (or leave a message)  Thank-you. CURRENT COMCGRNS  During the last Federal Election our  organization faced a difficult decision concerning the degree of support  that we could offer women candidates.  Do all women candidates deserve  endorsement? Can we remain strictly  non-partisan and still actively sup  port women in politics? If not, can  we sacrifice one stand for the other?  In this issue we'll present the  opinions of two members of VSW, women  who are well acquainted with political  processes. We urge you to read this  material and the questionnaire that  follows and respond carefully. We  want to be prepared for future elections with a policy that is representative of our membership*  OF TWO MINDS  You don't have to spend too long in  the women's movement - a few months, -  or perhaps a year - to come up against  the hard fact that every change for  which women are asking can be achieved  in only one way - by literally begging  male legislators to change it for us.  We may believe that we are writing  very intellectual briefs and impressive letters, or even demanding change,  but when you really stop to analyse  our actions, we are following our  life-time conditioning of begging  "Big Daddy" or "Darling Husband" for  favours.  Many of us find this process not only  frustrating, but degrading. We are  doomed, however, to continue it for  many years to come. A recent study  of women in politics in the United  States pointed out that women's  issues, such as day care, equal pay,  etc. have been overlooked by male  legislators, not because the men are  callous, but simply because these  issues are outside their experience  and therefore have low priority for  them.  The only hope that I see of having  these issues treated seriously is to  elect enough women to government to  give women a real voice in decisions  affecting women.  By enough, I mean  50 per cent of the seats in municipal  councils, the provincial legislature  and the House of Commons.  The Royal Commission on the Status  of Women lias—a-very good chapter on  the problems facing women who run for  political office, and the reasons so  few ever made it in the past. How  are we doing today, four years later?  While twice as many women (137) ran  in the last federal election as in  the 1972 election, we elected only  nine women to a House of Commons of  264 members. That comes to 3.4 per  cent, not exactly what you would call  an influential voting block.  Why are so few women elected? There  are many reasons, but I believe that  the main reason is fear. Women are  afraid to get involved in what they  consider the dirty business of politics.  They are afraid for two reasons:  first, because it is about the toughest  career that you can get into; and  secondly, because women know so little  about politics that they are afraid  to display their ignorance.  It is far easier to assume a lofty,  holier-than-thou attitude and say  that we are ahove politics. We have  come as far as being willing to vote  for a woman candidate, but most women  are completely unaware of the fact  that unless we get out and WORK for  women candidates we will never get  them elected.  When the Status of Women was organized nearly four years ago, we  invited several successful women  politicians to speak at one of our  early meetings. Every one of them,  without exception, admitted that they  had been deeply hurt by the fact that  the traditional women's groups to  which they belonged had refused to  support them in their campaigns.  "Our organization must remain nonpartisan," was the typical excuse.  But as soon as the women were elected,  they were expected to appear on  demand to make speeches, open fund-  raising events, pour tea, etc.  Those of us on the executive of the  Status of Women at that time resolved  that we would never betray women in  this fashion. One of our top priorities would be to help women get  elected. As a non-partisan group, we  realized that we could not openly  support any one candidate, but in the  1972 provincial election we held an  all-women cnadidates meeting and we  encouraged all of our members to get  out and work for the candidate of  their choice. As a result, two of  our members were elected, Rosemary  Brown and Phyllis Young.  They have been invaluable to the  Status of Women in supporting our  requests for financial assistance to  Status of Women groups, and in promoting the appointment of many women  to influential positions in B.C.  (e.g. Kathleen Ruff as the director  of the Human Rights Act, Judge Nancy  Morrison to her judgeship and to the  Labour Relations Board, Reva Dexter  to her new position in the Department  of Education). While we may not be  entirely happy with what the provincial government has done for women,  without the influence of Rosemary  Brown, Phyllis Young and Eileen Dailly,  I am sure that even less would have  been done.  In the recent federal election, the  Status of Women limited its assistance to women candidates to writing  some excellent articles for Kinesis  about the need to help women candidates.  But typical of our naivety  about politics, this issue reached  members only a week or two before ,  the election.  By then, it was too  late for potential supporters to do  much more than vote for the woman  candidate.  If the Status of Women really wants  to elect women to public office, it  is essential that we develop a policy  that provides effective help, hot  just lip service.  It is also essential that the policy be communicated  to all members through Kinesis. Then,  if an election is called on short  notice, as the recent federal election was, we will be ready to help  women in an effective way.  The policy should be non-partisan and  it must provide equal treatment for  women of all parties, whether the  executive of the day happens to  believe in that party or not.  I am  aware that most NDP women believe,  with a faith that outshines that of  the staunchest Christian, that only  through socialism will women gain  equality.  (They don't explain why  women in such socialist countries as  Russia, China and the Scandinavian  countries, or for that matter in NDP  governed Canadian provinces, have not  yet achieved equality).  Those of us who are a little more  realistic are convinced that in a  democratic country with a three-party  system such as Canada has, it is  imperative that women be encouraged  to run for all parties. Only then  can we be sure of having women's  interests represented, no matter  which party is in power. VSW policy must recognize that women  will not be elected without a terrific amount of support from other  women, both in time and money.  Women have a tougher fight to get  their party's nomination than men do;  they have a tougher time raising  money to finance their campaigns;  they have a tougher time getting  publicity because the news media does  not treat their candidacy seriously;  and they have a tougher time recruiting workers.  Some party workers,  both male and female, feel it is a  waste of time to work for a woman  candidate, perhaps because women have  traditionally been allowed to run  only in losing ridings, where, of  course, they lost.  While the woman candidate may have  fewer helpers and less money than  her male opponent, she must still  compete with him in every way.  She  must canvas up to 90,000 households  in her riding, attend dozens of all-  candidates meetings, prepare speeches,  become informed on every conceivable  topic so as to be ready for the  loaded questions that are planted in  every audience; shake hands with  hundreds of people at shopping centres, parks, bus stops, or even stand,  as I did at 6:30 a.m. in the pouring  rain for three hours to wave to  thousands of commuters on the Oak  Street bridge.  The major assistance that I believe  the VSW could give to women candidates would be to provide a method  of informing other VSW members that  a woman is running and needs help.  In my case, I ran in the suburban  riding of Burnaby, Richmond, Delta,  which was pretty well ignored by the  Vancouver papers. Many women acquaintances did not even know that I was  running until well into the el erf-inn .  Women running in small towns may  never be mentioned in the Vancouver  news media until election night.  Yet many of us could help them if  we knew early enough that they were  running.  I would like to suggest that the  Status of Women could, without endangering its non-partisan position,  make its mailing list available to  women candidates, or perhaps just to  VSW members (both male and female).  The candidates could then send a  letter to all members very early in  the campaign, announcing their candidacy and listing some of the ways  other women could help, if they  choose. And I emphasize the word  choose.  I am not suggesting for a minute that  all of our members should automatically go out and work for any woman  candidate.  If they do not believe  in the party for which she is running,  or do not want to support the woman  herself, they have merely to throw  the letter in the waste basket along  with the rest of their junk mail.  (Hopefully, they will then go out  and work for someone they do support).  But if they do believe in the woman's  candidacy, the early notification  will give them a real opportunity to  work effectively for her election,  not just the chance to vote for her  if they happen to live in her riding.  What can women do to help? There are  obvious needs, like money and volunteer canvassers, but there are many  other ways of helping that are just  as effective and which can be done  from another riding without even  leaving home.  For example:  - phone or write letters to all  your friends and relatives in  the woman's riding asking them  to vote for her;  - type address labels for large  mailings;  - do telephone polling, or canvassing.  There is nothing more educational  than working on a political campaign,  and I only wish that I had started  at a much younger age.  It is significant that the U.S. study I mentioned earlier found that 75 per cent  of successful women politicians did  not run for office until they were  over 40 years of age, while 90 per  cent of the men made their first  attempt before 40. Just one more  strike against women. We enter the  game late and have to compete with  much more experienced and younger  men. At 46, I was running against  two men in their early 30's.  One last point: you don't have to  join a political party to work on a  campaign or attend its meetings. Two  of my most effective workers had  previously worked for other parties.  So why not investigate all political  parties right now and plan to get  personally involved in the next  election.  It's not far off. Municipal elections are coming up in  November.  Find a woman candidate  in your area and encourage her to  run. Then get out and help her.  It's one of the most exciting experiences you'll ever have!  P.S. And don't forget to fill out  the questionnaire and help set VSW  policy on women in politics.  - Joan Wallace  The notion that the Status of Women  should get involved in actively supporting women candidates is superficially an appealing one. However,  it is also, in my view, a rather  dangerous proposal—one which  could jeopardise the continued  strenth of our organization.  There are two basic flaws in the  proposal.  In the first place it  ignores the obvious fact that  some women who seek office do  not basically support the goals  of the Status of Women or the  Women's Movement in general.  Secondly, the proposal ignores the  basic nature of the Canadian  political system.  Unfortunately, there are women who  run for office at all levels of  government who do not support our  goals. When they are elected (and  we have examples both in Ottawa  and Victoria), and do not support  our causes, they do us more damage  than hostile males. They are  pointed to by governments as proof  that women in general do not  really want the changes we are  fighting for—that we are just a  noisy minority.  I do not believe  we are doing a service to the  women's movement by urging our  members to vote for women indiscriminately just because they are  women.  In all parties—Liberal,  Conservative, and NDP—there are  a handful of men who are more  supportive of our cause than some  elected women members.  For these  reasons we believe that it would  be a mistake to support just any  woman candidate.  I am even more concerned about  the fact that the proposal ignores  the fact that, unlike the United  States whose system allows great  freedom to individual elected  members, in Canada, under the  parliamentary system, our elected  members, with very rare exception,  vote on strict party lines.- The  policy of the party, therefore, is  infinitely more important that the  views of individual elected members.  Accordingly, it is a logical step  for an organization such as our to  move from endorsing or supporting  individual candidates to supporting  the party whose policy or record  we find most attractive.  In fact,  some of our members have, on occasion, advocated this policy.  I believe this step would be fatal.  Our strength as an organization  lies in the diversity of our membership and our unity on major issues.  Once we involve our organization  in endorsing and supporting candidates and, inevitably, their  parties, we will see the beginning  of factualization which can only  bring division and weakness. We  will see an NDP caucus within the  Status of Women, a Liberal caucus,  etc., and our organization will  be endangered.  Instead I believe that we must  continue our positive policy of  speaking out on issues of concern  to women, of advocating political  changes, and of criticizing ALL  politicians whose actions are  contrary to the interests of the  women's movement. I believe we can go further. By  working for equal opportunity for  women in all areas we are working  for equal opportunity for women in  the political sphere. The Royal  Commission on the Status of Women  recommends that women work for equal  representation within the parties  of their choice (recommendation  number 142 ) and I believe we can  help to equip women with the confidence, know-how, and skills to  be more effective in forming party  policy in fighting for nominations  and in winning election. We can develop a programme to provide political  skills which can be equally useful to  women in every party. In this way we  can contribute to the election of  more women candidates without dividing  our organization. We can urge our  members, as we have done in the past  to work for the candidates of their  choice; we can bring to our members  through our newsletter the views of  women candidates on issues that are  of concern to us; we can hold all  candidates meetings and bring up  questions that are important to  women; we can inform our members of  issues that they can raise with candidates in their own ridings.  I believe we can be and are effective  as a lobbying group. Our briefs,  letters, and appearances at government hearings have had effect.  The  Vancouver Status of Women is, as a  result of these efforts, now represented on five working groups of the  Royal Commission on Family and Children's Law, on the Police Commission  Task Force on Women, The UBC Senate,  The Family Law Foundation, The Provincial Advisory Committee on Sexism  in Public Education, and the Human  Rights Commission—all of which form  policies that affect our lives and  further the aims of our organization.  We have seen recommendations in our  briefs eneacted in labour legislation and the Human Rights Code.  These achievements are the result of  action, of continuing pressure, on  a non-partisan basis. We can continue  to move ahead in this way, or we can  jeopardize our progress by turning to  political factionalism.  More women such as Kathleen Ruff, Na  Nancy Morrison, and Reva Dexter, are  being appointed to positions of importance.  I believe that this is  because the women's movement as a  whole has made people more aware of  women's abilities and that governments are responding by selecting  women for these positions on the ba  basis of thier competance, abilities  and merits. The task for the Vancouver Status of Women is to continue to increase this awareness in  all areas—both the public and the  private sector.  Finally, I believe that the suggestions that our membership lists be  made available for use by anyone  other than the Vancouver Status of  Womwn would be a mistake.  Our members are entitled to privacy; many  would be disturbed to find that they  are ending up on anyone's mailing  list as a result of joining Vancouver  Status of Women, and this could  seriously impair the growth of our  membership.  Gene Errington  your   opinion  POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT  1. VSW will feature women candidates  in KINESIS and sponsor all candidates  meetings on women's issues whenever  possible (e.g. in the upcoming civic  election campaign). This would enable  members to decide for themselves their  own degree of involvement.  Is this sufficient for you?  2. If not:  A. Should VSW solicit volunteers  from its membership to do canvassing and other campaign work?  B. Are you in favour of making our  membership list available to  candidates for appeals for votes  financial contributions and  volunteer work?  C. Would you j.oin a VSW permanent  political action committee, not  only to prepare to provide  assistance during election campaigns, but also to work between  elections to encourage women to  become involved in politics at  all levels?  3. Should we offer the outlined  assistance to:  A. All women candidates  B. Women candidates who display a  serious concern about inequities  pertaining to women and a genuine desire to correct them.  C. Male candidates who have consistently supported women's issues.  D. No candidates.  4. Other suggestions:  KINESIS - Does It Meet the Needs   of VSW Members?   1. Is KINESIS an effective communication link among members?  2. Does KINESIS give you the information you want and need?  3. Is there any subject that KINESIS  has not dealt with adequately?  4. Are the features interesting?  5. Do you like the content of KINESIS?  6. Would you prefer a more business-,  like newsletter?  7. Would you contribute articles or  art to Kinesis?  8. Other comments or criticisms:  VSW SERVICES & RESOURCES  1. Have you made use of any of the  following services of VSW in the  past year?  A. Ombuds  B. Transition House  C. Orientation meetings  D. General meetings  E. Special summer workshop  F. Other  A. What was your general impression  of the services/presentation  offered?  B. Would you recommend VSW services  to others?  C.

RESULTS ...'OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE PLUS THE OPINIONS OF EXECUTIVE MEMBERS what's  being done  A recommendation will be made to the  Federal Government, by the Advisory  Council on the Status of Women (ACSW),  that a Canadian Human Rights Commission be set up in honour of International Women's Year, 1975.  Katie Cooke, ACSW Chairwoman, made  the announcement at a recent meeting  of the University Women's Club in  Vancouver. She says that the absence  of a Federal Human Rights Commission  is a "disgrace" to Canada's leadership  Ms. Cooke says that another priority  recommendation by the Federally  appointed body will be that the  Canadian Citizenship Act be amended.  She says that as it stands, Canadian  women are not permitted to confer  citizenship to foreign born children  of alien fathers. Canadian men, on  the other hand, are not subject to  this ruling. Ms. Cooke says the Act  is an "insult to all Canadian women,"  and must be changed.  Another ACSW recommendation to the  Government, she says, will be that  housewives be included in the Canada  ABOUT  MEN  HUMAN   RIGHTS   BRANCH  PROTECTS   MEN'S   RIGHTS  Most   sex   Qiscrimmation  cases   handled  by   the  Human  Rights   Branch   involve  women  and   employers.     However,   in  the   summer,   employers   in        ,  tourist   related  businesses  often  want   to   hire   "nice  young   girls"   in   summer   jobs,  because   they   feel   it   is   better   public   relations.      They  argue   that   female   students  are   better   groomed,   friendlier,   and  more   responsible  than   males,   when   informed  that   the  Human   Rights  Act  prohibits   discrimination   by  sex.  Complaints   lodged   by   male  students   often   involve   this  type   of   stereotyping.      In  one   case,   a   small  plane   service  advertised   for   summer  help   to   meet   disembarking  passengers   and   hand   out  tourist   information.      "I  want   a   smiling   young  woman  to   meet   the  plane,"   the   owner   argued  when   a  male   student  applied.      "This   is   a   public  relations   job."     After   discussing  with   a  Human  Rights  worker   the   job   duties   and  the   type   of   impression  he  wanted  his   business   to   leave  With  his   passengers,   he   did  Pension Plan, as the assumption that  "Daddy" will take care of his wife  when she is old is proving to be  "archaic."  Ms.  Cooke says that to date only  one-third of the Recommendations of  the Royal Commission Report on the  Status of Women have been implemented  and that 1975,  declared by the  United Nations as International  Women's Year,  is a fine opportunity  for women to pressure Governments  to pass more of the RCSW recommendations.    She says that although there  are a record nine women in Parliament, women must continue to push  for equality under the law.  The ACSW prepared booklet,  "What's  Been Done?" an assessment of the  implementation by the Federal Government of the recommendations of the  RCSW, can be obtained by writing to  63 Sparks Street, Box 1541,  Station  B, Ottawa, Ontario.    The ACSW urges  groups, organizations and individuals  to make their views known to those  who make the laws:  their Member of  Parliament, Marc LaLonde, Minister  of Health and Welfare,   the new  Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women,  and ministers responsible  for the action needed in specific  recommendations, with carbon copies  to ACSW c/o the Status of Women  office,  2029 West 4th Avenue.  admit   that   the   qualifications  of   friendliness,   neatness   and  responsibility  would  be   just  as   effective   in   a  young  man.  After  being   assured   that  he  was   not   bound   to   hire   a   scruffy   applicant   of   either   sex,  he   agreed   to   interview  males  as  well   as   females.  Because   of   the   temporary  nature   of   summer   jobs,   employers'   prejudices   are   often   less  deeply   ingrained   than  in  other  areas   of   work.     When   confronted  with   applicants   of   both  sexes,   often   for   the   first  time,   employers   can   change  their   attitudes   very   quickly.  Restaurants,   too,   want   waiters.      "I   don't   think   you  would  fit   into   our  uniforms."   a   laughing  manager   told   one  male   student.     After  being   contacted   by  a  Human  Rights   worker   she   did  concede   that   a  waiter  would   be  as   efficient   as   waitresses,  and   that   getting  him  a   uniform  would   not   pose   a   big   problem.  A  Victoria   telephone   answering   service   advertised   for   summer   help  with  no   experience  necessary,   but   flatly   refused  to   consider   a  male   applicant.  "This   is   a  woman's   organization,"  the   manager   insisted,    "a   woman's  type   of   job.     We   just   couldn't  hire   a  man."     After   seeing   that  the   Human  Rights   Act  views   sex  discrimination   in   the   same   light  as   race   or   colour   discrimination,  she  was   finally  won   over   through  pride.     Her   company  had   boasted  about   its   equal   opportunity  hiring   practices,   but   began   to  look  hypocritical   by   its   practice   of   allowing   sex   discrimination .  female  offenders  ine.HonouraDie warren  Allmand, Solicitor General  of Canada, announced today  the establishment of a National Advisory Committee  on Female Offenders serving  sentences under federal jurisdiction.  The Advisory Committee  will study the needs of federal female inmates and recommend treatment and training programs best suited  for their effective rehabilitation.  The Advisory Committee  will examine such areas as  population profile of federal female inmates, existing penitentiary facilities,  programs to meet their present and future needs, and  develop plans for parole and  aftercare needs of the female  offender.  The Committee will  also make recommendations on  the calibre of staff required and the training necessary for them in order to  effectively implement new  programs.  The National Advisory  Committee will consist of  seven members and will be  chaired by Professor Donna  Clark of the School of  Social Work, University of  Toronto.  Professor Clark has many  years of experience in the  field of corrections.  She  has worked for the Ontario  Department of Corrections,  and was Superintendent of  the Vanier Institute for  Women.  The other members of the  National Advisory Committee  are: i  Margaret Benson, Toronto,  member of the National Parole Board.  Madame Maryrose Lette,  Montreal, member of the National Parole Board.  Judge Sandra Oxner of  Halifax.  Phyllis Haslam, Executive Director, Elizabeth  Fry Society of Toronto.  Marie Marulie, Ottawa,  Executive Director of the  National Indian Brotherhood.  Ethel Allardice, Vancouver,  Executive Director, Elizabeth  Fry Society of British  Columbia.  Each Provincial and Territorial government is being  asked to appoint a representative who will liaise  with the Advisory Committee  and present the views of his  or her particular region.  The National Advisory Committee is expected to complete its study in six months  and make specific recommendations to the Commissioner of  Penitentiaries and the Executive Director of the National Parole Service.  NEWS     NEWS     NEWS     NEWS Women make different educational and career decisions  than men because of a subtle  and pervasive channelling process, which limits their available choices.  This process  starts at birth and is reinforced in the home, the total  school environment and the  working world."  Such were the findings of the  WOMEN'S RESEARCH COLLECTIVE in  their report, Voices of Women  Students, a 54-page long brochure  released in September.  The Collective, a group of five  women who worked for six months  on this study, was funded by  an L.I.P. grant and sponsored  by the Women's Action Group and  the Women's Office, both located  at the University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, B.C.

The  so made sug-  g changes to  iversity in  their horizons  r choices.  In addition, they made comments  on how women professors and  women's studies affected their  academic choices.  Many of the  women students made remarks  about the women's movement and  how it affected them.  The interviewees, randomly  selected from the total population of women students in the  school year 1973-74, are representative of a wide range of the  university's departments and  areas of study.  All the women  students, the Report stresses,  speak with their own voices  out of their own experience.  Without changes in the total  environment, the Report states,  the traditional reinforcement  of male-female stereotypes will  continue to exist.  The school  system mirrors society's attitudes towards women.  So far,  as the researchers found out,  high school counsellors help  perpetuate society's acceptance  of roles divided along sex lines  In the words of a woman student,  "I had this counsellor she  had a big discussion once about  what women should do, should  they have a family or have a  career.  She thought we should  have children.  It was kind of  heavy for grade 8."  Although little girls start off  with great expectations about  what they can do with their  lives, their expectations are  soon lowered and eroded, the  Report says, because of a pervasive and subtle channelling  process.  Women get pressured to conform  to behaviour considered "proper.'  They feel this pressure on the  part of counsellors, teachers  and peer group.  "When I showed  my intelligence, in say my  science classes, I was completely scorned out by the other  students .... I really repressed  that desire to do anything in  science because I thought,  well, that wasn't really what  I should do," one woman student  said .  While another said that "Girls  in school are too often told  this and that, and guys are  talked to and given a choice,  like, the girls tended to not  act on their own, whereas the  guys would."

As the Report points out,  "There is a discrepancy between  this (feminine) image and the  image of t'.ie serious student  and scholar.  A conflict arises  for many women when they feel  they must conform to the feminine image as well as the  student image an irreconcilable goal.  This conflict  drains her of much of^ her  energy."  Sexist jokes and put-downs are  not unusual in the classroom  environment.  A medical student  gives an instance:  "My professors, some of them are  unnerved by having girls in  the class.  They feel they can't  tell dirty jokes.  And sometimes they tell, oh, one example,  in neurology, some of them are  crude about it.  The jaw muscles....when your jaws open,  it's harder to close them than  when it's pulled open.  So he  gets a woman to stand up in  front of the class and says,  'hold your jaws open, honey,'  and he pushes on them and says,  'you see, you can never shut a  woman's mouth'."  The Report points out that  women students are becoming  increasingly dissatisfied with  the inequalities in the university.  Many already have clear  ideas of what should be done  to change the university's indifference and lack of concern.  One interviewee feels that  action should be taken so that  change "could start at all different levels...at the staff,  at the teaching level, hiring  more women in teaching positions  and in research positions, so  that when women are involved  in a department they'll have  other women to be associated  with."  Women students feel that there  is a need for more women professors in all areas.  As the  Report points out, they "do  provide not only a visible alternative to the traditional  female roles, but also the support and encouragement women  students need."  Along with more women faculty,  an expansion of interdisciplinary programmes such as Women's  Studies, now offered on a limited basis at U.B.C, would meet  women's needs and make their  education more meaningful and  relevant, the Report stresses.  The brochure has also included  an appendix, with lists of  suggested reading and services  available to women students.  Copies of Voices of Women Students can be obtained from the  Women's Office, Box 85, Student  Union  Building, the University  of British Columbia, Vancouver,  B.C.

Liz Kinsella sand,  Sun, sand and tropical waters!  The mystic Orient, exotic islands!  Advertisers use these worn-out  phrases repeatedly to entice the  general public to buy packaged  tours to practically anywhere on  earth, and it is obvious that  these romantic notions are what  attract the average person to a  career in the travel industry.  Travel agencies don't generally  advertise for staff.  They are  inundated with applications from  people, particularly women, who  envision a glamorous, exciting  life once they become agents.  Many of these people leave the  industry after not too many months,  disillusioned with the frustrating  work and the low salary.  Too often  women are hired as secretaries or  receptionists and when their dreams  of being trained as an international  agent aren't realized within the  first year, they move on.  Very  seldom does an employee hired as a  typist end up as anything more  than a typist,and, as we all know,  typing is typing regardless of the  material content. And, if you can  reap more dollars clattering away  at law reports, why not?  It is unfortunate that most people  persist in the misconception that  travel agents spend their time  taking round-the-world tours to the  most exotic places. When you get  down to it, it's merely a job that  must be performed like any other.  The busiest season^September to  April,(though it seems to be perpetually busy) can be a harassing  time for all agents. Everyone  wants to escape the B.C. winter and  each one of them is in search of  sun and warmth.  Clients expect  perfection from their travel agent-  from their flight being on time, to  75p weather, and if all does not  run smoothly, the agent is the first  to know. More often than not, you  will hear nothing upon the client's  return, although in a few rare  cases, you may actually receive a  postcard thanking you for their trip  of a lifetime.  Moments such as  these compensate for all the frustrations involved in planning their  holiday.  Dealing with business people requires  precision work and if' even one small  notation in an airline guide has been  overlooked, the result could be total  chaos.  Clients going on holiday  likely won't worry if their flight  actually departs an hour later than  stated on their tickets and itinerary.  But if a ticketing error has  been made the opposite way and a  businessperson flying to New York for  a meeting watches helplessly as his  plane takes off the runway, the agency  may stand to lose a very large account.  The travel industry is everchanging and  an agent must always keep informed of  the new fares and regulations, which  are continually being revised. Postal strikes create bedlam: and airline  strikes, unimagineable disaster!  And then, there's the brighter side  of a travel agent's work. Cocktail  parties put on by airlines, cruise  companies or wholesalers who are  trying to promote a new service; the  occasional tour trip to help acquaint  an agent with a country unfamiliar to  the agent; and after one year with  the company, the employee is entitled  to a 75% reduction on airfare and  cruises.  Attractive as these benefits may seem,  it is doubtful they are the prime  reason agents stay in the business.  What is even more important is the  challenge of successfully fulfilling  a person's travel whims, the great  responsibility this entails, and the  endless variety in each day.  The monotonous routine of a 9-5 job is nonexistent.  The monetary rewards may be  few, but rewards in personal achievement and satisfaction more than compensate.

This ad is adolescent in its  portrayal of the male, "sport", who  can handle a number of women at one  time (i.e., keep them in their place)  and in its presentation of women as  good sports if they don't object to  being reated like a "plaything" in  a chorus line.  This ad is sexist in that it reinforces detrimental stereotypes of  both men and women, typecasts them  into master and slave roles.

Pacific women's Graphic Arts Cooperative Association is a long name  with nineteen members and seven  children, a rented house in Vancouver's  East End, a lot of graphic arts para-  phenalia and a lot of energy.  It  has also become a part of the daily  lives of 12 people involved in its  FIRST functional appendage, The Ad  Company (so called because that's  what it is.)  As a group our goals have been to  provide employment for single women,  primarily single mothers, at a fair  salary, and on the job training.  Employment for people who are interested and talented in graphic arts  but possibly not formally educated  in the area, and who have been unable  to find jobs. We want to be able to  define our own work roles, be our  own bosses. We have daycare on the  premises so we don't have to be away  from our children all day or bus  them all around the city to day-care  centres. We're idealistic.  Our L.E.A.P. funding came through  in January with enough cash to see  us safely on our feet for a year,  up to three years if we can prove  ourselves able to become self-  sufficient.  By its very nature a co-operative is  a magnificent creation. The profits  are not personal, they go into projects that serve the community. Our  first task is to develop an advertising agency that will enable local  businesses and community groups to  get good advertising at a reasonable  price.  In the process there will be  an exchange of information in the  co-op so that everyone will understand  the whole operation from bookkeeping  to photo work to preparing camera-  ready copy. The co-operative is open  for unlimited expansion. We hope to  have people join who would be interested in setting up other projects  with the co-operative. This has an  unlimited potential; it could involve  co-operative printing house, maybe  even a credit union.some day.

People doing sales, paste-up,  layout, typesetting, etc.  One exceptional non-single mother is  Jerry. He and Nancy spend the day  together with the children. Our  initial plan was to alternate child-  minding days among everyone in the  group.  That was one initial plan  among many that was scrapped after  several months of trial. Children  need a lot more continuity than we  could offer that way and seem to  appreciate the change. Now we take  turns relieving the child-minders on  their lunch break.  Before January we had several meetings  to discusp where and how to work and  we were all basically agreed on what  had to be done.  In January it became  evident that we definitely had strong  major differences of opinion.  There  were twelve different ideas on how  to raise children (from children  raise themselves to heavy corporal  punishment). There were more ideas  and variations on how to do everything  than there were people involved in  doing things. We discovered character differences and differences in  11  ideals, we all stuck to our various  truths and nearly got a collective  ulcer. Three months later we finally  began to discover each other and work  together. The ideals still vary but  the goals are similar so we're finally on our way and discovering how  to solve problems.  It was July before  we realized that the project was working.  Seven months have taught us all  a lot about graphic arts, organization and co-operation.  Some people  have left, others have joined. We've  changed a lot and will with any luck,  continue to do so.  Sometime next year we hope to begin  producing children's books and a  women's community magazine, a forum  for local talents.  Right now we're doing posters, newspaper ads, signs, forms, cards,  typesetting; anything that can be  printed or painted.  One of the best things that has come  out of this project so far is the  realization for each woman that she  can do anything.  That a mother's  working can open up creative doors  for parent and child. That we can  organize and teach and learn together.  That we can provide enjoyable employment for ourselves.  That a job  doesn't have to become a category or  a barrier to expansion. I guess  there are a lot of the best things.  The worst things are becoming less  cumbersome.  Right now we're looking for a larger  space to work out of, possibly a  warehouse. There must be a yard and  enough space for nineteen people to  move about in freely, and for a lot  of equipment.  If you hear of anything, need some work done or want  to join the co-operative, call  253-8931, The Ad Company.  carol thompson  ANY WAY YOU SAY IT.  (Western Canadian Women's News Service)  According to provincial court judge,  Nancy Morrison, women are still  being portrayed "in sniggering tones  by the media and (they) are not yet  taken seriously in the sports and  financial pages or by advertising  companies."  (LIFTING THE LID OFF  THE PICKLE JAR, The Vancouver Sun,  July 9, 1974).  During WCWN's on-going examination  of women's press coverage, it was  found that the subliminal message  that headlines leave are helping to  reinforce the traditional images  that are held of women and are  creating new stereotypes which are  equally limiting.  The headlines are often sarcastic,  derogatory and sexual in nature and  retain the various prejudices that  are held about women,  (i.e. that  they are boring and uninteresting,  that they bitch and complain, are  unfeminine, aggressive and sinful  when they do what has been traditionally considered "for men only," and  are supposed to act "sweet and  ladylike.")

I   am   sure   there   will   be   many  who   will   disagree   with   me;  many  who   will   see   the   film  merely   as   another   of   the   unnecessarily   violent   films   which  Hollywood   seems   to   be   churning  out   ad   nauseum.      However,   it  stands   in  marked   contrast   to  the   vast   majority   of   the   new  Hollywood   films   which   either  ignore   women   completely,   or  portray   them   as   simple   minded,  masochistic   sluts.      In   "Buster  and   Billie",    the   female   character   is   sympathetic   and   possesses  both   humanity   and   personal  integrity.  -   Patricia   Evans  Over the next few months we will  be publishing information on  feminist films available for rental  to  interested groups.     The list  composed by Terry McNeny is long.  Therefore, we wil publish it  in  serial  form by subject.     This months  list of films deals with women in  the arts.

Federation of Labour Committee on Women's Rights have conducted a survey of affiliated union  members to gauge the prevalence of  child care related problems.  The survey results: 42% of those  who answered, both men and women,  had difficulty at some time, with  babysitting arrangements. Those in  favour of 24 hour child care, on-the-  job day care and child care information centres, were 86%. Of those  who replied, 71% were willing to  assist in establishing these facilities.  One third of the participants, had  turned down a job, promotion or pay  raise, sincex they were unable to make  suitable arrangements for the care of  children.  The Women's Rights Committee subsequently prepared a brief, containing  the findings of the questionnaire,  with particular reference to child  care needs and presented the piece  in November 1973, to Minister of  Human Resources, Norman Levi. To  date, the Committee has heard nothing.  - Marilyn Cairnduff, Secretary  Committee on Women's Rights  B.C. Federation of Labour  The Yukon Child Care Association  was formed in April to promote the  development of various forms of day  care service in the Yukon.  Among its projects is a plan to build  up a network of family day care homes  which would take children too young  for a day care centre, those on a  centre's waiting list and the child  ren whose families choose a family  day care home over a center. The  day care home mother would be supervised from a centre and would have  the responsibilities and benefits  of a staff member.  The Association is presently working  with the Department of Social Welfare to set standards and regulations for child care facilities under  the Child Welfare Act. However, the  Association is also working towards  a ''ñ† long term goal of new legislation  in the form of a consolidated Day  Care Act for the Yukon through which  all forms of day care would be regulated.  It hopes to see basic minimum  standards set to ensure the pretection  of all.  - Yukon Status of Women  Council Newsletter  The Child Care Centre, which is presently in the Lutheran Church in  Whitehorse, has been offering services to pre-school children for six  years now.  It has been a financial  struggle to make ends meet. Staff  salaries, equipment, craft supplies,  space per child, have all had to be  sacrificed to keep the doors open.  Board members have had to give generously of both their time and  energies on countless occasions.  In the Yukon Territory, day care is  a relatively new concept.  Its  growth in the past year has more  than quadrupled.  If facilities are  to be kept up to a minimum standard,  they must have the support of not  only parents, but also of the community.  From the community must  come support, both financial and  physical, the actual giving of oneself to serve as an active board  member and if possible, to volunteer.  Make sure you are aware and concerned  about the Child Care issue. The  child who grows up to be a beneficial  citizen and community member will  also be a benefit to you.  - Carol Oberg  Child Care Centre  Yukon  Many women in rural areas have voiced  concern that their small children  have little opportunity to play with  others of their own age group.     It  is feared that the government is  overlooking this aspect in determining the need for centres.  - Editor, Kinesis  member  named  education  advisor  Reva Dexter, VSW executive member,  has been appointed by Education  Minister, Eileen Dailly to advise on  the elimination of sex discrimination  in schools. She will be studying  sexism in printed and visual materials  used in schools as well as working on  a curriculum review committee. An  important facet of her job will be  working with teacher training programmes at the three provincial  universities so that teachers will  be able to recognize and deal with  sex typing situations in schools.  Her own experience as a high school  counsellor makes her very aware of  the necessity of this programme.  Reva has been a member of VSW for  three years, and was Education Chairperson for a year. As a staff member  she was involved in various educational projects such as the investigation of sexism in text books and  the school speaking programme. At  present Reva is a member-at-large on  the VSW Executive.  BOOKS FOR LITTLE FEU^Lli  The Education Action Group has  recently completed an annotated  bibliography of non-sexist  children's books. -All of the  books have been read by those  preparing the list. The bibliography may be obtained from  the Status of Women office for  50c. We would like to encourage  parents to show the list to  their children's school librarian  and to their local librarian so t  that they may obtain the books.  Plans are underway to do a similar list for older children.  If  you are interested in helping  with this project, contact Nadine  at the VSW office 736-3746. We  could use your help.

I'm back full of enthusiasm for  a new idea - a Federal Action Committee for VSW. We were woefully  unprepared for the last federal  election and indeed have not been  heavily involved with the federal  portion of the Status of Women Report.  I think the purposes of  such a committee should be:  1. To become throughly familiar  with the issues in the federal  recommendations in the report  and the choices for satisfactory  implementation of these recommendations.  2. To maintain contact with Vancouver area M.P.'s and senators  on these issues.  3. To maintain contact with women's  groups throughout Canada as to  their actions and reactions on  these issues in order to coordinate action.  4. To publicize the issues and the  actions.  5. To take appropriate action ourselves .  6. To learn the /skills necessary to  carry out any of the above objectives.  Interested? Join our first planning  session at the office at 7:30, Tues.,  October 15.  For further information  call Diana Bissell at 736-3746 or  Alice James at 261-8084.

Dear Mesdames:  Enclosed please find my cheque for  my current membership in the VSW.  Sorry it's not more $$ but I've  returned to university this year  and am finding the budget a little  tighter!  Just finished reading my copy of  Kinesis (Sept 74), and have a few  comments.  Enjoyed very much the  "Media Scanner" section, as well  as the "Three Pioneers" article.  Re "Three Contemporary Women" (I  counted four, didn't I?) Are you  looking for suggestions for stories  on other contemporary women? If so,  may I recommend Ms. Iona Campagnolo,  who was recently elected M.P. for  Skeena.  She & I both worked for  the same radio station in Prince  Rupert, where we became good friends.  She is a wonderfully interesting,  charming woman who has done and said  many things (and will no doubt carry  on in the same vein in her new political career), and has received  numerous awards for her activities  including the Order of Canada.  She  can be reached in Ottawa, or at her  home - 724 - 8th Avenue East,  Prince Rupert, B.C.  I have one criticism I think I'm  getting my "Kinesis" kind of late.  Ads for things like registering for  the B.C. Federation of Women Convention in September are much too late  for me even though I can't go anyway.  This has happened before.  Is  there a solution?  Applause, applause for Marie Herbert,  R.N. who resents being a "blank" in  the federal political system!  So do  I! This winter was the first time  in my life I hadn't worked outside  the home; I chose to remain at home  and be a "homemaker".  I must say I  worked harder and enjoyed it a lot  less and it sure makes me burn that  the Canadian government doesn't recognize my contribution (even tho' my  husband does). To Marion Bailey who  said that all married women living  with their husbands are listed as  Mrs. Joe Smith:  this doesn't have  to be so I requested that I be  listed as Mrs. Judith Bussinger, and  that was done. What disturbed me  about the enumeration in my area was  that no one even came to my door to  ask me or my husband who we were or  what we did. One morning I went down  to the mailbox and there were the two  pieces of paper one with my husband's  name and occupation, the other with  me as Mrs. Earl Bussinger, BLANK.  I  phoned to have the first name switched  to mine, tho' I had no success with  the occupation. The whole affair  made me feel like a real nothing   just an extension of my husband and  his life, not a person in her own  right.  I'm proud of my husband and  happy to be married to him, but I'm  a person too!  Thanks for letting me sound off!  kr\A  thanks for "Kinesis."  Yours sincerely,  (Mrs.) Judith Bussinger  Dear Editor:  I find Kinesis to be a very interesting and enlightening publication  with respect to the areas it covers.  However, some of the articles are  too general, in that they do not  concentrate on specific "Vancouverite"  examples. For example "Women in  Real Estate Today" and "Women in  High School Today" (both September  issue) were both interesting articles,  accurately outlining the present  status of both areas. However, both  articles lacked coverage of any  specific Vancouverites presently  active in these two areas. I know  many women in both high school and  real estate whose personal comments  and opinions would have greatly  enhanced the above-named articles.  Other sections of the paper, such as  "Media Scanner" contained minimal  information on Vancouver women. Our  own newspapers and magazines should  be 'scanned' a little more carefully.  Much of Kinesis dealt with Canadian  women in general. Although I think  it is important for us to be aware  of the activities of other women in  Canada and the rest of the world, I  deem it equally important to familiarize ourselves with our- sisters  right here at home. There are countless women here in Vancouver, active  in all areas, making marvelous contributions to the women's movement  and, more importantly, towards an  improved world for all. So let's  hear more from them!  Hoping to hear more from our local  sisters, I am,  Marjorie E. Artis  'Vancouverite' interested in  everything, especially other  interested 'Vancouverites'.  P.S. "Wordwork" was an excellent  example of the great creativity  and talent that Vancouver's  women possess.  Thank you,  beautiful sisters.  15  Ed. Note: Thank you for both your  praise and criticism.  Since many  of our concerns are with legislation and situations that fall under federal and provincial jurisdiction, much of our material will  apply to all Canadian women, not  just those living in Vancouver.  However, a great deal of our  paper is written by and about  Vancouver^women. The article,  WOMEN IN HIGH SCHOOL TODAY was  written by Rachelle van Halm, a  Vancouver high school student  based on observations about her  school.  WOMEN IN REAL ESTATE was  written by a Vancouverite and researched in Vancouver with interviews with the Vancouver real estate community. Please .expect to  see an article soon by a woman  detailing her experiences in real  estate. The career articles which  we began in March Vancouver women  discuss their careers (Architect,  Planner, NeWs Editor, travel Consultant, etc.). The July issue  focussed on Vancouver women in the  fine arts who were feature performers in the Vancouver noon-hour  program during August. Of the  four women spotlighted in the artice  on the Order of Canada, Doris Shadbolt is a Vancouverite. Last months  media scanner criticized the writing  of three Vancouver women journalists.  I don't think we're snubbing Vancouver  women - we've just never felt it was  necessary to label the natives.  Dear People,  I was just wondering why "Ms." was  not used for Margaret Atwood,  Micheline Beauchemin and Doris Shadbolt  for the September page 8 article,  "Three Contemporary Women", rather  than Miss and Mrs. Why was it felt  necessary to use any prefix at all?  As usual, I found this issue of  Kinesis interesting and informative.  Wishing you well.  - Betty-Ann Buss  Editors Note: Sorry for the  oversight.  GET  INTO  ACTION.
