C., as midwives Gloria  Lemay and Mary Sullivan go  to court this" month to face  charges of criminal negligence and practising medicine  without a licence. Charges  arise from the death of  "baby Voth" in May of 1985,  at a homebirth attended by  Sullivan and Lemay.  A rally in support of the  two midwives will be held  outside the courthouse at  Robson and Hornby at 9:15 am  on May 12, the first day of  the trial.  One of the important defense  arguments at the trial will  be that a hospital is no  guarantee of a safe delivery or a healthy baby. From  January to June 1985, 56  babies died before, during  or shortly after birth, at  Vancouver's Grace Hospital  (Selected Delivery Room  Statistics, Grace Hospital).  The issue of fetus as person  will also likely come up at  the trial, as "baby Voth"  never drew breath outside  his mother's body. A court  ordered ban on publication  currently in effect (which  prevents us from printing  further details of the  case) will be lifted when  the trial begins.  Canada's midwifery community is in a critical position at this time. While the  Ontario government has  recently committed itself  to introducing midwifery  into the health care system, members of the Canadian Medical Association  council on health care  are calling for studies to  find out how doctors could  better meet the needs of  birthing mothers.  One of the members, Dr.  Hedy Fry, said recently  "I can't see how a lay  midwife could (give) better care than a nurse or  physician. The family physician offers the optimum  continuity of care."  The Lemay/Sullivan case is  the focus of considerable  attention, not only in  Vancouver, but across Canada.  A successful defense of  Mary Sullivan and Gloria  Lemay could be instrumental in changing the public  perception of midwifery and  thus eventually bringing  about legal recognition of  home birth attendants in  B.C.  Gloria and Mary need money  to mount a successful trial.  Please send donations to:  Sullivan-Lemay Legal Action  Fund, Maternal Health Society,  Box 46563,  Station G,  Vancouver,  B.C.   V6R 4G8.

The CRTC, a federal government body that regulates the  broadcast media, decided in  1979 that sex-role stereotyping had to go. A two year  period of media industry self-  regulation ended in 1984 and  the CRTC is holding hearings  to find out if self-regulation  works and, if not, what to do  next.  Women's organizations—all of  whom supported the MediaWatch  call for industry regulation—  (see Kinesis January 1986)  and industry producers such  as the Canadian Association  of Broadcasters and the Advertising Advisory Board  (AAB) presented at the hearing.  Self-regulation is a great  success according to the  broadcasters and advertisers.  They believe the most significant success has been in  educating the industry that  sex-role stereotyping even  existed.  "They (the industry) genuinely  did not understand the problem,  they didn't recognize the problem of sex-role stereotyping,"  said Alan Ray, AAB representative.  With the aid of a VCR Ray demonstrated the advertisers'  inherent naivete. There, for  all to view, was a beautiful  young woman poised seductively  on a high diving board, prepared to plunge. Suddenly, a  distinctly gruff male voice-  over -sounding suspiciously  hungry - drooled, "Beef is  good. Good to you, good for  you.. .today's lean  beef. Looking]  good,  beef."  CRTC continued page 2  Women's groups dispute  Dalkon Shield deadline  by Esther Shannon  Two Canadian women's health  groups have filed a lawsuit  against the manufacturer of  the Dalkon Shield—a contraceptive device sold in the  early 70's that caused severe  health problems—charging  that the court-imposed deadline for claims discriminates  against Canadian women.  The Vancouver Women's Health  Collective and the Winnipeg  Health Clinic are arguing  that A.H. Robins, manufacturer of the shield, should be  forced to extend the claims  deadline because the company  has not conducted an adequate  notification program outside  the United States.  The American courts have ordered that all claims against  Robins must be settled in one  trial and have declared April  30th, 1986 as the cut-off  date for claims. The health  groups have filed an application in Virginia Bankruptcy  Court seeking to have the  deadline extended for Canadian  women.  According to the health groups  Robins was not required to notify Canadian women directly  through radio, television and  print media advertising as was  the case with the American  notification procedure. The  groups are charging the different notification proced-'  ures are discriminatory  against women in foreign countries .  More than 150,000 have been  filed, most from the U.S., since  the deadline was imposed. Some  1.7 million Canadian women  bought and wore the shield.  Lawsuits against the company  contend that the design of the  shield allowed bacteria to  enter the uterus via the  strings of the device and  caused pelvic inflammatory  disease, blood poisoning, infections, sterility and spontaneous abortions. So far  the shield has been linked to  the deaths of 16 women.  According to an article in  Healthsharing,  an Ontario magazine, Robins has sought the  protection of U.S. bankruptcy  laws in a move to stall proceedings and limit liability.  As of August 1985, Robins  has spent $378 million to  settle just over 9,300 claims.  Healthsharing  says delays have  allowed the company to set a-  side the money needed to handle  Dalkon litigation and it has  earned enormous interest  which has offset any actual  out-of-pocket costs to the  company.  The CRTC should immediately  provide guidelines to control the production and  broadcast of violent, sexist  music videos aimed at young  people, the Quebec Council  on the Status of Women told  the Commissioners at a public hearing in Montreal.  Francine McKenzie, Council  president, told the hearings that a preliminary  study by the Quebec council  suggests that adolescent  boys and girls recognize  violence and sexism in  music videos but will continue to watch them because they  like the music and the rock  stars.  The council interviewed 161  girls and 120 boys aged 12  to 17 in public and private  schools in the Quebec City  region in January.  The majority of the girls  said they disliked videos  showing semi-naked women  next to fully-clothed men  and videos with women being treated as slaves.  They complained that the  women are always very  beautiful while the men are  always in superior roles.  They also said they eventually get used to the violence  because it is such a common  element of the videos.  Our apologies  In the February Kinesis we carried an  article "Feasting on Indian Women's Misery," which dealt with how tours from the  West exploit Indian women as a tourist  commodity. In a letter which accompanied  the submission, Kinesis was led to believe  that the article was about a tour of India  and Nepal set for March of 1986 and organized by Fran Hosken, editor of Womens  International Network (WIN) News. We  have since been informed (see letters page  28) that the article was actually about  another tour which occurred two years prior  to the planned Hosken tour. We have also  learned that Madhu Kishwar and Ruth  Vanita, editors of Manushi and the authors  of the article, have disassociated themselves  from any protest against the Hosken tour  and also strongly object to their article  being used to criticize the Hosken tour.  We believe the confusion and misrepresentation surrounding the entire situation is  unfortunate and we deeply regret any harm  our printing the article may have caused  Fran Hosken. 2     Kinesis May 1986  Across BC     3  Housing    4  Rosemary Brown  6  Across Canada  7  No Name Column   9   ■  International  Armagh Prison 10  Supplement: Status of Women  Expo 12  Megaprojects    13  Native Status 14  Labour     15  Native Land Claims 18  Education 21  Health 22  Fighting Back    23  • Expo Cartoon 24  Arts  Money Seeds 25  Censorship t 26  Moscow Women    27  Speculative Fiction .' 28  Rubymusic 29  Commentary    30  Letters 31  Bulletin Board  34  ■ Kinesis .welcomes volunteers to work on all  aspects of the paper.

MOVEMENT MATTERS  CRTC from page 1  According to Ray, the accusation that this  ad is sexist and the suggestion that the  woman is being equated in any way with beef  is "ridiculous".  Ray later explained the AAB would dismiss  .public complaints because the woman was not  depicted in a sex-role stereotype since  both women and men  dive into pools. Ray  pointed out that the CRTC voluntary guidelines are only concerned with ending industry sex-role stereotyping of women.  A point repeatedly stressed by industry  spokespeople was that sex-role stereotyping is indeed a genuine concern to the  industry, and through self-regulation it  is educating and 'sensitizing' itself to  this serious issue.  CAB president, David Bond, asked the CRTC  to continue with self-regulation not only  because it has proved successful but also  to allow "public-spirited business people  to respond in an effective and direct  way to a significant social challenge.  Just as social values and perceptions  change, broadcasters are actively involved in reflecting these changes."  According to Ray, through self-regulation  the industry is conscious of sex-role  stereotyping and through concerted efforts  to end it they are now depicting the truth  about women on the screen.

"We're quite pleased," he said, "and I  think pretty proud of the fact that the  educative process, the sensitizing process  that we went through has worked."  Suzanne Keeler, also of the AAB, insisted  that there has_ also been substantial in  the honest portrayal of women. "Gradually  we're finding that more and more kinds of  portrayals of women which were accepted  or debated five years ago are now universally not accepted. The use of a woman  in a bikini on the hood of a car for example is something that you rarely see  today... if she's on the hood of a car  then she's got a reason  to be there,"  Keeler said.  Asked whether there is a relation between the male control of the industry  and negative portrayals of women, Bond  gave an unequivocable "no". Speaking as  president of the CAB he said, "I hate to  think that I'm somehow greviously deficient because through the accident of  genes I turned out to be male instead of  female."  Women's organizations presenting at the ^  CRTC hearing into sex-role stereotyping  included: MediaWatch, Vancouver Status  of Women, and Vancouver Co-op Radio's  Women's Committee.  These organizations were united behind  MediaWatch's call for the adoption of  the following recommendations:  •the Broadcast Act be amended to allow  the CRTC to introduce regulations  to eliminate sex-role stereotyping  on radio and television  •the CRTC introduce regulations requiring radio and television stations to  set targets and time-frames for improving their depiction of women and girls  •the CRTC monitor the performance and  impose penalties, such as fines,  suspensions and revocation of licenses  on broadcasters which fail to comply  with the guidelines.  Further hearings will be held in May in  Montreal and Hull.   «QUEL NUMER0 WHAT NUMBER ?»  or The Electronic Sweatshop  A FILM BY SOPHIE BISSONNETTE  Time: 7:30 pm  Date: Thursday, May 22  Place: Women In Focus  456 W.

NEW ZEALAND:  Broadsheet, Auckland  Women's Bookshop, Christchurch s»  May 1986 Kinesis     3  ACROSS BC  Equality Conference  examines progress  by Susan O'Donnell  Women from throughout British  Columbia gathered in early  April in Vancouver for a conference on "Equality: One  Year Later."  The conference intended to  assess the past year's action  from all levels of government  and to provide education to  representatives of provincial  women's groups. The conference was basically successful in its objectives, although content was unevenly  presented at times.  Beth Symes, the keynote  speaker, briefly reviewed  pre-Charter legislation which  has formed the basis of the  status of women litigation.  Symes said that litigation  as a strategy for change in  itself, is expensive and  time consuming.. However, she  believes that with a focus of  lobbying and education, there  is a place for carefully chosen cases to be taken to court.  According to Symes the Women's  Legal, Education and Action  . Fund (LEAF) is starting  with simple cases that show  blatant discrimination, in  order to effect a beginning  move toward equality.  The conference was warned that  there is a worrisome aspect of  testing Section 15 in the  courts. This can be seen in  the case involving the Child  Paternity and Support Act,  now in the B.C. Court of  Appeal. This case argues that  the Act is discriminatory to  men because it only demands  child support from fathers.  The courts have struck down the  the legislation, giving men  temporary release from child  maintenance responsibilities.  Hard work put in by feminists  to remove the right to question a woman's previous sexual history in rape cases is  also in jeopardy. It is now  being argued that this denies  due process to the accused.  The federal government amended one piece of legislation,  The Canada Shipping Act. This  Act was modified to require  that women at sea send part  of their money home in the  same way that men were required to do. Some provinces  ignored compliance totally.  By far the highlight of the  conference was Lynn Smith's  presentation on theories of  equality. She started the  workshop with a general discussion on why theories matter. She explained that government legislative refort  is based, whether explicitly  or implicitly on what equality means. Because judicial  decision making will take  place in the light of some  theory of equality, women's  groups in working for the  implementation of equality  rights must have a clear view  of the meaning of equality.  If a theory is lacking, inconsistent positions will be  taken and efforts wasted.  For those of us who are new  to the equality game, there  is a new zip word to describe  us. Throughout the conference  we were described as "equality seekers". One of the participants was quite repulsed  by the term, saying the term  indicated "internal" and  "never finding". In closing  the "never finding" part seems  to be appropriate to the am-  bivalance women feel toward  Section 15. At the end of  the conference I am no clearer as to whether it will move  us forward or set us back.

VLC calls meeting  to discuss Lotus Hotel  The Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA) will  be appearing before Vancouver city council in early May  to seek council endorsement  of DERA's hotel boycott list.  One downtown hotel, the Lotus,  will not be on the boycott  list because DERA has no  proof - written eviction  notices - that the Lotus  has evicted tenants for  Expo,,says Joanne Hochu,  DERA worker.  Group supports women strikers  by Noreen Howes  The Women's Strike Support  Coalition, representing forty  women from a dozen unions,  was formed in January 1986  as a response to ever-mounting labour struggles. Members,  of the WSSC are finding  increased difficulty in having their demands as trade  union women met, and are  often frustrated within their  unions as well as at their  workplaces.  "Our objective is to have a  committee where women can  come and ask for support in  critical, immediate, trade  union struggles," said Jean  Rands, representative of the  Women's Strike Support Coalition. She continued to outline methods of support for  trade union women, from picket-  ting during a strike or lockout  to promoting consumer boycotts.  "Women come to us not because  they feel their union is  doing a bad  job," said Rands,  "but because they feel that  there were other things that  could be done."  Due to the growing number of  women trade union members  particularly in non-traditional—female ghetto—sectors  such as retail workers and  bank workers, the WSSC be- .  lieves their role is increasingly significant.  Support from the WSSC has  occured around the following  issues:  •Eaton's workers (RWDSU)—  consumer boycott  •Visa workers (Union of Bank  Employees)—leafletting  •White Spot Restaurant j  workers (FASWOC)—leafletting  •CKVU Employees Union—support  picketting, leafletting  •PWA Flight Attendants  (CALFA)—support picketting,  leafletting  According to Hochu, however,  the Lotus has undergone  extensive renovations, is  advertising in San Francisco  based travel magazines and  has raised its rates to  $60 per night.  Tenants on fixed incomes  and who cannot afford these  increases will obviously  have to find other accomodation. Harold Scarrow, a 61  year old Lotus tenant who  committed suicide by throw-  himself under a garbage  truck in April,, was one of  the tenants forced to move  because of the increased  rents.  The Lotus is well known in  the Vancouver lesbian community as it offers women-  only nights Wednesdays  through Saturday in'its disco.  There is no other women-only  nightclub in Vancouver.  Bet Cecil, a spokesperson  for the Vancouver Lesbian  Connection (VLC) says it's  hard to get information on  what is really happening at  the Lotus.  "As far as we know," she said,  "the Lotus hasn't evicted  anyone but if they are putting up their rates and  people'already living there ■  can't afford them, that'; a  de facto eviction."  Lesbian networking meeting/  discussion on the Lotus Hotel, May 8,   7:30 at the  Vancouver Lesbian Connection,  876 Commercial Drive.  Anti-soliciting law running into barrier after barrier  The federal government's new  anti-street soliciting law is  running into barrier after  barrier in British Columbia's  courts.  Recent decisions by two provincial court judges have left  the law seriously_weakened. In-  evitabley the two court cases —  or others — are going to end  up in the Supreme Court of  Canada.  In one of the B.C. court decisions the judge decided  that a car is not a public  place. In the other the judge  ruled that the ^communication"  section of the law is dangerously vague. The Crown is  appealing both decisions in  the provincial Supreme Court  in May.  The problems with the new  legislation had been seen by  many long before the bill was  passed by parliament in December. The B.C. and Canadian  Civil Liberties Associations,  the Canadian Bar Association,  the Elizabeth Fry Society and  prostitutes rights groups  all slammed the bill because  it gave outrageous enforcement powers to the police.  Prostitutes also warned that  the law would force, them into  working alone, making them  more vulnerable to dangerous  customers.  According the Marie Arrington,  spokesperson for Prostitutes  and Other Women for Equal  Rights (POWER), two prostitutes have been murdered since  the new bill came into effect  and another, Lisa Marie Morri-  ssin, is missing and friends  fear that she has also been  murdered.  The court decisions have  meant that more Vancouver  prostitutes are heading back  to their old territories and  also that neighbourhood anti-  prostitute groups are once  again gearing up for a showdown in their communities.  • A demonstration against street  soliciting held in the Mount  Pleasant area of Vancouver  attracted over forty residents  who said that unless there  was police action against pros  titutes there would inevitableyl  be violence. 4     Kinesis May 1986  May 1986 Kinesis     5  by Gretchen Lang  Dorothy  (not her real name) is sixty-six,  she was living in the Savoy Hotel and  decided to move to the Brazil.

Downtown Eastside Social Worker  Why talk about the women's housing crisis as distinct from the housing problems facing men in Vancouver's downtown  eastside? Most social workers in the east  •Women comprise 20 percent of the population of the downtown eastside.  •On average, women in the downtown east-  side of Vancouver die 17 years younger  than their counterparts in the city as  a whole.  •Suicides are four times higher and homo-  cides are about twice as frequent.  •The majority of the women are single  and among the poorest in the city.  •Their social assistance and disability  incomes gross less, on average, than  $5,000 per year.  •In a recent survey, conducted by the  Downtown Eastside Women's Centre, of  the 52 women interviewed, 62 percent  were between the ages of 35-60. 81 percent were single and 53 percent lived  alone.  •After paying an average rent of $262.00  per month, those who live on Social  Assistance had $100 remaining for all  other expenses. Women who recived disability pensions had $200 leftover to  purchase food, clothing, entertainment  etc.  •46 percent of the women had moved 1-6  times within the area during the past  year. Their reasons for moving were:  dirt, cockroaches, cheaper rent, harassment, drinking parties, noise,  evictions, etc.  •63 percent of the women had either a  physical or psychiatric disability.  44 percent of the entire sample, had  at some time been psychiatrically ill  and had been hospitalised on an average of six times.  Downtown eastside  facing housing  side will tell you that only 20 percent  of the population is made up of women,  that most of the women in the area don't  live down here, or that they live with  men. In the panic of recent Expo evictions it's hard to get an agency to talk  about women's special needs.  And yet the studies are there, collecting  dust in the files of the Downtown East-  side Women's Centre. Single women, the  report says, although a minority, have  a greater need for low income housing  than men.  Single women have a greater  need for low income housing  than men.  Women are in the market more often  than the rest of the population,  and have fewer options in that market when they do go looking for a  home. Why are these realities ignored  while women are sleeping in the rain?  In a recent national housing report  women were found to make up a majority of this county's renters; 63  percent compared to 29 percent  men. Women, it says, can seldom save  to buy houses while working part-  time or in low income jobs.  Women have fewer options in the  housing market because of their  specific needs. Not surprisingly,  what bites hardest into women's  choices about housing is poverty.  Women, since they still only earn  60 percent of men's wages, need  cheap housing.  Women also need safe housing. Women  living alone are more vulnerable  to harassment., violence and theft.  Women need housing that works for  children and single mothers. According to the national report, this includes clean, safe housing and housing that is near schools, playgrounds,  laundry, shops and social services.  Single mothers, most of whom have low  incomes,  generally cannot afford child  childcare or bus fare to services far  away.  These are the limitations placed on  women renters simply because of their  sex. The above facts largely address  poor working women. But for mbst women  in the downtown eastside of Vancouver,  58 percent of whom live on government  aid, those facts don't begin to describe their housing crisis.  Rena, a native woman, is smoking and  working the rings on her fingers up  over the knuckles. In the bar of the  Sunrise Hotel on Hastings there are  at least as many women as men. Late  afternoon sun slants through the  smoke. Rena has been room-hunting.  "We started down at the Astoria and  worked our way up. Phuf! Nothing."  Rena lives at the Brandis Hotel on  Hastings and Columbia, one of the  better hotels in the a  Chinese grandmothers  While working on this story I received  a phone call from the First United  Church which is active in fighting  homelessness. They mentioned that a  large number of applicants for housing were elderly Chinese women.  'Their families sponsor them to com<  to Canada," says Stella Ng "and if  grandmothers won't look after the  children or if families break down,  they get kicked out."  Ng works at SUCCESS, a Chinese community service centre in the downtown  eastside. She speaks of the high  expectations Chinese elders have when  they leave their homeland for Canada,  and the disappointment they feel  when they discover they are not  often respected in Canada as elders  are in China.  women  crisis  When asked where people are going now  that these hotels are evicting tenants for Expo Rena says, "People are  in lobbies. And you know those big  garbage cans? Smithwrights, yea.  People sleep in those."  Younger women have another option. We  met Rebecca at the Downtown Eastside  Residents Association, (DERA), an  agency which is placing most people  evicted from hotels. Rebecca is a  pretty woman, somewhere in her twenties. She in now facing eviction from  her suite in the West End. She has  lived with men who provided shelter  and money expecting she would provide  them with sex.  "He was so much older than me", she  says of one of the men she lived with  a year and a half ago, "But I was  stuck. The money was tight so I ended  up with him."  Rebecca is not about to go to the  government for help. "It would only  be trouble", she says. "You know how  the government takes care of you."  In ten years time living with men  may not be an option for Rebecca.  The average age of death for women in  the downtown eastside is fifty-seven.  "By the time you're thirty-five down  here you're hitting middle-age", says  Laurel Kimbley of the DTES Women's  Centre.  "If you can't sell your body, and you have  no skills, once you're beyond the age of  35, you're not marketable", she says  bitterly.  "When a woman in the downtown eastside  goes looking for a home she is usually  handicapped by one-or more problems.  Drug or alcohol dependence, emotional  or psychiatric problems, language bar-  iers or just simply not enough money.  "You need a rent receipt to get welfare  for housing. But who's going to write  you out a rent receipt when you're  down and out," says Laurel.  Psychiatric or emotional problems also  close doors on a woman's chance for a  home. One comment from the Society  for Women's Residence  betrayed by Canada  "(A grandmother) is treated like a  maid. She gets no money from the family. She has to do what she is told."  On top of this Chinese women are cut  off from society because of the language barrier. "They are like newly  blind people," Ng says.  When these women are forced out onto  the street, they usually end up in  rooming houses in Chinatown. Inelig-*  ible for government assistance because they are supposed to be sponsored by their families, the government may place 'them there, Ng says. .  The rooms rent for 90-100 dollars  a month she says and contain only a  bed. "Sometimes not even a window."  "People live there for ten, fifteen,  even thirty years."  Chinese women, she reminds me, are  very reserved. "They don't talk  about it. Women won't complain."  "Women with psychiatric histories have  a really difficult time of:it because  of the stigma attached to it. Nine times  out of ten a hotel manager or landlord  will say 'I don't want you being crazy  around me or my tenants.'"  Often managing to get in the door is  not where the problem ends, -if it's a  door to a hotel or a rooming house.  In the late 1970's city hall staff  sampled 23 rooming houses and hotels  and found almost 10,000 by-law violations. Last summer city hall officials  again found peeling walls, bad wiring,  windows nailed shut, ceilings falling  in, and dark trecherous hallways. Most  rooms range from 50 to 120 square feet  and were built to be used by a transient population, loggers mostly, for  short stays. The rooms were not built  as permanent residences.  Women have particular problems in the  hotels especially because they are a  minority in a predominantly male environment. Single women, including  older women, are harassed, assaulted  and sometimes sexually abused. The  Society for Women's Residences heard  these voices:  "I don't feel safe. When I lived down  here I used to have an iron bar across  my door because it was nothing for a  drunk to come in or even a sober man  to come in."  "I've also heard of landlords causing  problems. Asking for favours that the  woman may not want to give. The landlord holds the key to her room. That's  pretty frightening."  "The men are terrible, they're a pain  in the ass. They get drinking. A woman  alone. You have to watch yourself every  minute."  "It's not okay" says Laurel "it's disgusting. Hotels are not the answer for  women." Housing continued page 33  Centre supports downtown women  by Kim Irving  Vancouver's downtown eastside is full of.  contradictions. One is the two-s.ided clock  on the Bank of Montreal building at  Carrall and Hastings that reads 20  minutes slower on one side than the  other. Another is the most expensive  and largest world's exposition, situated only three blocks from the city's  economically poorest area.  The 11-year-old Downtown Eastside Women's Centre (DEWC) is the only  women's centre in the city core. The  DEWC is visited by 50-60 women daily.  Many of these women come because they  want a break from the isolation of hotel  rooms. Some women have spent time in  jail or mental hospitals and need to  reconnect with a community and many more  come to socialize with one another.  The Centre provides a supportive and  safe environment through information  and advocacy services, support groups,  peer counselling and self-education  programs. In the last 6 months, demands  for their services has increased by 40  percent.  Yet, last year the centre lost its  provincial funding and has been refused  federal funding. Presently, it exists  on a $20,000 grant from City Hall.  Even with such meager funding, the centre  survives. They presently have one full-  time co-ordinator and numerous volunteers  who assist with the daily work of the  centre.  The Women's Centre has recently applied  to City Hall Social Planning for land  or a building to construct a 30 to 40  unit housing project. The project has  been organized by an impressive and  active board of women lawyers, accountants, architects and DEWC volunteers. If  accepted, the housing units will give  preference to women over 35, single  parents and disabled women.  The women's centre has already received  numerous applications for housing,  mostly from local women who have existed  either on welfare or minimum wage work.  Another project of the women's centre,  which took a year's preparation, is the  newly opened bakery. It is hoped that  it will eventually provide further income for the centre.  Essential to the women's centre's philosophy is its openess to all women,  regardless of their religious, or political beliefs, or their sexual orientation. Women.at the centre streas that  they do not want to be portrayed or  treated as victims but be recognized  as part of a community, much like any  other Vancouver Community.  Despite the necessary work the centre  does and the ambitious projects, the  women's centre has largely remained  unrecognized by both the downtown east-  side community workers and the feminist community at large. On one scale  they are seen as radical feminists and  on the other scale not radical enough;  once again: the contradictions of the  downtown eastside. «*.        6     Kinesis May 1986  ACROSS CANADA  Feminists release review of criminal law and women  by Barb Findlay  The basic value underlying the Review  can be stated as a belief that women  live in a partriarchal world,  subject  to male domination and control. The  two relevant questions are therefore:  (1) to what extent should the criminal  law be used as a means to combat the  various manifestations of the subordination of women?,  and  (2) to the extent that the criminal law  itself is an instrument of male domination,  how should it be reduced as a  means of patriarchal control of women's  lives?  In other words,  how can the criminal  law be used as a weapon against patriarchy and be reduced as a weapon of  patriarchy? It may not in fact be possible to do- both. Harnassing State power  for women's purposes may (if it is possible) have some practical impact with  respect to particular issues.  Concern  may be felt,  however,  that this is not  empowering to women and fails to address  the role of the State in furthering  male interests. Thus feminism has been  caught between giving more power to the  State in each attempt to claim it for  women...  Thus begins the report, A Feminist Review of Criminal Law, commissioned by  Status of Women Canada.  Written by Christine Boyle, a law pro-,  fessor at Dalhousie, Marie-Andree Ber-  . trand, a professor of criminology at  University of Montreal, Celine Lacerte-  Lamontagne, a criminal lawyer in Quebec, and Rebecca Shamai, a criminal  lawyer in Ontario, the report focuses  on the areas of criminal law which  affect women and makes recommendations  for changes.  "A conflict of intersts arises if criminal law is used against women who  'defraud' the State while the State does  not provide for women's basic needs."  -excerpt from the review  Public reaction to the report has fo-  cussed on the "controversial" areas:  its recommendation that abortion be removed from the Criminal Code, and  its assertion that women ought to be  aquitted of theft charges if what they  are stealing is food for their children.  John Crosbie, the Minister of Justice,  said he has no plans to change Canada's  abortion laws. His view is that the current laws are the result of compromise  and consensus from the late sixties and  no other consensus has formed since that  time {Globe and Mail,   April 8). He also  rejected the report's proposal that  accused people be able to advance a  necessity defence in the case of theft  of food for children, and similar situa-:  tions, saying that to do so would open  a huge hole in the law.  But the report is not an outlandish list  of implausible ideas. It is a careful  and principled look at the ways in which  the criminal law affects women as accused  persons, as victims, as people having  an interest in what matters should be  defined as crimes. It considers not only  the areas where the criminal law speaks,  but the areas where the criminal law  is silent.  It discusses a feminist vision of the  criminal law, in the context of the  actual experience of women rather than  the context of academic journals.  The human need for shelter, food and  clothing is more important than property  interests. But the criminal law  protects property interests (through  offenses like theft). Nowhere does it  protect the right to feed yourself in  order to survive. That hierarchy of values-—property over life—is wrong, says  but only if he or she has just been  assaulted. It makes no allowance for the  situation of a woman who has been terrorized for years by an abusive husband,  and who as a last resort assaults or  kills her abuser at at time when, for  example, he is drunk or asleep. The  authors assert that the present law relating to self-defense is sexist (and  therefore contrary to the Charter of  Rights) because whether or not an accused  is justified in assaulting someone is  judged by male standards of what response  is "reasonable." It recommends that what  is "reasonable" should be judged against  the woman's own situation and options.  In looking at a "feminist vision of the  criminal law", the authors ask such '  questions as whether we should change  our notions of property, e.g. by changing our law of theft to reflect a willingness to share. Can we learn other  values from native Canadians? Are there  sufficiently severe limitations on  possession and use of. firearms? Is the  environment sufficiently protected by  the criminal law?  "Wives cannot now be compelled to testify against their husbands. Should  this rule be abolished? Should it be  extended to lesbians and common-law  relationships?"  -excerpt from the  the Review. The criminal law should  recognize that life interests are more  important than property interests by  allowing the defence of necessity to  charges of theft, welfare fraud, etc.  The law of self-defence currently permits a victim of an assault to retaliate—  The Contemporary Sag^ Of Little Mellon      by Terri Roberton and Harris Taylor  The Report does not pretend to be the  last word on the feminist perspective  on criminal law. It carefully notes  where there appears to be feminist consensus on an issue (e.g. repeal of  the abortion provisions in the criminal  code), no consensus (e.g. on what to do  about pornography) and where the discussions have not yet begun. For example,  should a woman be able to advance, as a  defence to a criminal charge, that she  was suffering from premenstrual syndrome  at the time she committed the offense?  On the one hand, there is how a significant body of work describing the  effects on PMS on some women. On the  other hand, do we really want a defense  that says we are potentially crazy  when menstruating? The Report says it  is premature to decide this issue.  The authors see section 15 of the Charter of Rights, the equality rights  section which came into force a year  ago, as holding significant potential  in the development of the criminal law  as it relates to women. "Equal" should  not mean that men and women are treated  the same, they say. But women should be  careful about the positions they take.  For example: does the Charter require  the State to spend money, and take  affirmative steps, to ensure that no  more women than men are victims of  sexual violence? If it did, would it  be helpful—or would such measures  simply reinforce notions of women as  the weaker sex?  The report is readable, and short (147  pages of text). It is available from  Communications Unit, Status of Women  Canada, 151 Sparks Street, La Promenade  Building, 10th Floor, Ottawa, Ont.  K1A 1C3. Highly recommended reading. May 1986 Kinesis     7  ACROSS CANADA  She shoots, but no score yet for girl  Justine Blainey may finally  have the law on her team.  Blainey, a 13 year old Toronto teenager who wants to  play hockey on a boy's team,  was brought closer to her  goal by an April Ontario  Court of Appeal decision.  The Court has struck down as  unconstitutional a law that  prohibited her from playing  in a hockey league because of  her sex.  The invalidated section of  the Ontario Human Rights Code  permitted sex discrimination  in athletic organizations and  denied Blainey equal protection and equal benefit of the  - law as guaranteed under the  Charter of Rights and Free  doms, Mr. Justice Charles  Dubin wrote for the majority  in the 2-1 decision.  Blainey is "ecstatic" and  says "I'm going to go to  try out and see if I can make  a team."  The court, in overturning a  lower court decision, found  that the human rights law violated section 15 of the  Charter—the equality rights  section—and is of "no force  or effect."  The court, however, did not go  so far as to give Blainey an  outright ruling that would  permit her to play on the boy's  team. Instead it sent her back  to the Ontario Human Rights  Commission to lay another com- .  Sterilization popular in Canada  A study, published by the  University of Alberta sociology department, shows  sterilization is the most  popular method of birth control in Canada ±  and that-  Canadian women are the West-,,  ern world's top users of  sterilization.  Canadian figures for sterilization are almost one-  third higher per capita than  those for the United States.  Evelyne Lapierre-Adamcyk, a  University of Montreal demographer who is a co-author  of the study said, "At the  beginning of the decade, there  were very few women (who)  would ask to be sterilized.  3ut in the middle of the seventies, it grew very quickly  and. women who have reached the  age of 40, a great number of  them have been sterilized."  Among Canadian women between  the ages of 18 and 49, from  35 to 37 percent have been  sterilized, according to the  study. The comparable rate  for men is about 10 percent,  Ms Lapierre-Adamcyk said.  Reliance on sterilization is  most widespread among married  and previously married women  over the age of 30, she said.  But she said that women under  30 are choosing sterilization  in increasing numbers once  they have had children.  The study involved telephone  interviews in 1984 with 5,315  women across Canada.  "Among the Western nations,  the North'American countries  have the highest rates."  She said the difference may  be accounted for in part by  the availability of medicare  in Canada, making sterilization a less expensive option.  Differences between North American and European sterilization rates seem to be due to  cultural differences, she said.  Generally, Canada and the  United States have favored  mechanical birth control  methods over natural methods,  such as the rhythm and coitus  interruptus, traditionally  used in Europe. Among the  study's findings was that a  rough parallel exists between  Catholics and non-Catholics  in the use of sterilization.  Ms Lapierre-Adamcyk said,  "there are some problems that  seem to show up with some  women," citing a recent study  of 500 Montreal-area women.  "They show regrets."  Younger women are most vulnerable to those regrets, she  said, especially if they have  been through a marriage  breakup and would like to have  the choice of having children  with a new partner.  The study found that the second most popular birth-control  method in Canada is the Pill,  followed by the sterilization  of men, condoms and intrauterine dei  plaint of discrimination against  the Ontario Hockey Association  under a different section of the  Code.  According to Justice Durbin, the  struck down section of the  human rights code—section  19(2)—sets no limits "K^IT^p^  or guidelines for permitting  discrimination in all athletic activities in Ontario.  "In substance, it permits the  posting of a. no females allowed  sign by every athletic organization in this province,"  Judge Dubin ruled.  Ontario Attorney-General, Ian  Scott, who has introduced  amendments to repeal that  section, said he was happy  with the ruling, since it means  the section is void.  Scott said the government will  not decide whether to pursue  the legislative changes until  a decision is made on whether  the ruling will be appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada.  Native women  denied their rights  Native women who live on reserves and get divorced are  not covered under provincial  matrimonial laws requiring  equal division of family  property the Supreme Court  of Canada has ruled.  The Court ruled unanimously.,  in April, that the Indian Act  gives the federal government  exclusive authority over  possession of land on Indian  reserves and that provincial  family laws do not apply to  reserve property.  The Court also ruled, however,  that a spouse — usually the  husband — can be ordered to  pay compensation in order to  adjust the division of family  assets.  As a result of the decision  Ruth Derrickson, a member of  B.C.'s Westbank Indian Band  who is divorcing her husband,  was denied a half interest in  their reserve property.  According to Louise Dulude,  vice-president of the National  Action Committee on the Status  of Women, the decision means  native women are at a disadvantage compared to other  women in Canada.  Dulude noted that most divor-  ing native couples would have  little money available to compensate for an unequal division  of property.  Moreover, property on an Indian  Indian reserve does not have  a high market value.  Dulude called on the federal  government to amend the Indian  Act to allow for the same  division of property as other  estranged couples in Canada  are subject to.  JOBS!  ^  Nanoose Peace  Camp celebrates  first birthday  On April 1, a birthday party  was held at the Nanoose Peace  Camp on Vancouver Island, to  celebrate the founding of the  camp one year ago.  The camp's three large tipis  have been pitched at Nanoose  Bay for 365 consecutive days  in an attempt to end weapons  testing in the Georgia Strait  and to convert the Canadian  Forces Maritime Experimental  and Test Ranges (CFMETR) to  non-military purposes.  CFMETR has been used for the  past 20 years by the U.S.  Navy to test weapons systems.  The Nanoose Conversion campaign peace camp organizers,  have been campaigning against  visits to the area by U.S.  nuclear-capable submarines  and ships. The lastest.of these  visits occurred in March of  this year when the U.S. nuclear attack sub Olympia  spent two days at Nanoose.  Recently,'public and media  speculation have suggested  there could be a renewal of  controversial U.S. agreements  which allow the U.S. to test  its naval weapons systems at  Nanoose. The agreement- officially expired in mid-April  and negotiations are underway.  "We expect that the agreement  will be renewed, said spokesperson Anne Lindsay, but even  if this happens, the agreement  can still be cancelled at any  time." The group said they were  jubilant that support, for a  nuclear free Nanoose has gainec  so much momentum since the  peace camp became its visible  symbol a year ago.  "It's grown from a tiny, unknown local issue into a national focus for peace activists in just a year, said  Brian Mills, who has spent  much of the past year at the  camp, and this gives us a  tremendous sense of hope."  The NCC hopes to focus much of  its attention over the next  year on what it sees as its  "long-term vision" for Nanoose:  conversion of CFMETR to "peaceful economically-productive,  and environmentally-sound  purposes."

Her geo-.  graphical constituency is Burnaby-  Edmonds, but Brown has a wider view.  "I see women as my constituency, and  minority groups, immigrants and children.  I ran on that platform, and.I've always  spoken, whether I was designated chief  spokesperson or not, on women's issues."  Brown wants to remain in the legislature  until there are enough women elected to  the House with a feminist perspective to  take over that task. "Then I can relinquish it." The next election may allow  her that. "We've got some wonderful  women candidates, and I'm hoping that a  number of them will be elected so that I  can retire. I'm getting tired."  It's not burnout. "I'm never going to stop.  I just want to do  other things.  I'm getting tired of the political arena.  I'm interested in other things and I can't  do them because I have to be here. I'm  teaching a course at UVic, Women and Human  Services,   in the Faculty of Social Work,  and I love it. I want to do more research.  Being in politics is so time consuming.  It is a 365 day a year job and it's pretty  much a 14, 15, 16 hour day. It doesn't  leave room for any other things.  I'm interested in the use of computers in  the delivery of social services, how computers work as a controlling device on  the workers as well as on the recipients.  Computers monitor what social workers do.  They were brought into the system presumably to make people faster. What they're  really doing is monitoring the pattern of  social worker practise, so they're not  breaking the rules.  .The naive way workers in the field of human  services just accepted the computer,  without recognizing the more sinister aspects of it, is something I want to research  All of these things are on the backburner  while I deal with this political stuff, so  I want to get out of it as soon as there  are women in the political areas to carry  that on.  I'm interested in the priqe women pay for  breaking the barriers we have to break,  for breaking through structures, for moving  into positions of power—the emotional,  psychological, as well as sociological and  economic prices we pay for that. And we all  pay the price.  Women in all areas—media, academia, health  or big business, once you move out from  middle management or clerical or the bottom,  the ghetto level, and say: "We want to move  into the decision-making process.' Once you  get there, you find there are penalties.  If we can design some kind of framework to  help other women coming behind us, then we  can go into the arena and survive better,  cut down on burnout and breakdown.  I don't have the answers, which is why I  need the time to do the research and the  study.  If you don't have a private life, you're not  a full person. You have to have a private  life if you're going to grow as a human  being. If not, you should be replaced by  a computer or a robot."  What is your base of support?  "I have an extradordinarily large base of  support from the women's community, and  it actually crosses party lines. Women  recognize that I'm not just working for  NDP women, I'm working for' women, period.  That is a base of support that I have  to rely on. I can't do the job without  it. But basically I'm a social democrat  and I have a base of support from social  democrats in my constituency and across  the country.  In most instances I'm raising issues  which wouldn't be raised if I wasn't  there, about women, racial and ethnic  minority groups, immigrants and children—social justice issues—and specific  issues which have to do with Burnaby-  Edmonds, because that's what I was  elected to do.  It's not simply that  there's any malice aforethought either,  within the party or government—why  these issues aren't raised—it's just  that no one thinks about these issues  because it's not part of their life  experiences."  What are your major goals as an MLA?  "My major goal converns equality for  women, and it hasn't happendd. We had  made some changes. We started funding  women's centres, rape relief centres,  transition houses, increased the delivery of child care around the province,  and formed a committee in the Ministry  of Education that dealt with sexism  in textbooks.  We were working toward really giving  women -the tools of power they would  need to achieve full equality. This  government has wiped all that out. It ;  eliminated all of those services we  put in place for women, and in exchange  for that has given women a deputy minister who has no power, no authority,  no money and concentrates on publishing  glossy brochures.  I find myself fighting for the kinds of  things I was fighting for in 1970-71,  1972, which we put into place. We have  to start all over again. We have to  become government, and construct a better foundation on which we build our  women's support so it won't be as easy  in the future to dismantle it. It was  easy for this government to just terminate funding for Vancouver Status, of  Women; what's happened to the transition house is a disgrace; the Women's  Health Collective—no funding at all;  rape relief centres—it's been an absolute and total disaster.  We are committed to putting those programs back in, but in a more secure  form. I don't know how we're going to  do that. That's the reason that Bob  Skelly and the women's committee spend  so much of our time continually  touching base with the women  ity, meeting with them, being involved  in everything that's going on. We want  to do more than reinstate programs,  we want to build an infrastructure that  would be impossible for future governments to eliminate.  We hope people begin to recognize that  this government really doesn't care  about working people, about ordinary  people. It certainly doesn't care about  women. Those women in our society concerned about issues surrounding control  over one's body and equal pay for work  of equal value and dignity and social  justice recognize that they have no  representation at all. Not one single  Social Credit elected member speaks  for them. I'm hoping women will soon  understand they have absolutely nothing  in common with Social Credit and that  Social Credit has no concern for them  at all."  I'm hoping women will soon  understand they have absolutely  nothing in common with the  Social Credit.  Why is the Social Credit party  successful?  "The Socred government uses a technique  of divide and conquer and it's very  effective. We have to recognize' that  this is their technique, and not allow  it to happen. I have no idea why people  vote Social Credit. We're continually  asking that and agonizing over it. If  I had the answer to that one I guess  we'd be able to change it. I don't know.  Is this a province of masochists? Do  they like being abused? And the Socred  government and the national conservative  government are hand in hand.  They take care of themselves and their  friends, and that's their weak spot.\  The only way to expose that is to bring;  it to the attention of the community  every time"it happens. On the other hand,  the weakest area of the communtiy is its  memory. It forgets so quickly the bad  things that happened and even the good  things.  When people ask, 'What are you going to  do about funding for transition houses  and rape relief centres?' I have to say,  'Hey! We're the people who funded them  in the first place. It's the Socreds  who are wiping them out.'  If there was something we could do  about stretching people's memories, the  Socreds wouldn't be as effective as  they are. The Socreds rely on people's  inability to remember. That's the rear-  son they can promise one thing, renege  on their promise, and come back and  promise it again. People believe them  the second time, because they've forgotten that these people never keep  their promises.  We can make people aware by talking to  each other through groups that actually speak to people rather than to  corporations and to industry.  You have to rely on people's basic intelligence, so if you say to them,  'If you go through the dpor, the  bucket of water that's suspended up  there is going to fall on you,' they're  going to say, 'Okay first I will remove  the bucket of water, and then I will  go through the'door.' Knowledge is  supposed to be power, right?" May 1986 Kinesis     9  JNo Name Column-  by Nora Randall  There's an immigrant women's group at  South Vancouver Neighbourhood House.  The East Indian women in the group used  to put on an ethnic lunch on the last  Thursday of every month. I say used to  because their funding may be cut and  the woman who runs the group is moving  to Saskatchewan because that's where  her husband can get a job. (I'm not  making this up. Life in B.C. is really  like this). Anyway, so I don't know if  they're doing the lunches anymore. But  when they were doing them I went to one  and had a most interesting time.  When I got to the neighbourhood house  at noon there was a line-up out the  front door. I just barely got my ticket  bought before the lunch was sold out.  When they opened the doors we all went  into this large room whdre long tables  were set out and covered with cheerful  tableclothes and silverware. Three or  four women were working in a tiny kitchen serving up plates with the different dishes tastefully arranged.  We filed past the counter and indicated  which dishes we'd like mostly by pointing since the women cooking didn't  speak much English and those of us waiting to try their food didn't speak any  Punjabi. Then the moment arrived when  I turned with my plate and faced a room  of strangers. Who to eat with? After a  moment of unfocused panic I found myself sitting at a table with five other  people. A man and woman in their  thirties had obviously come together and  stayed that way throughout the meal.  They ate steadily, conversed in low  private tones and took no part in the  general conversation. I can't say that  I talked much myself but I was a wildly  active listener.  It turned out that the woman on my left  was a pensioner from New Westminister.  She read about the ethnic lunches in  the Vancouver Sun  and she had come on  the bus bringing with her the man whci  rents a room from her. The other woman  at our table was an older woman from  Indonesia who had immigrated to Canada.  The reason I know all this is because  of the wonderful conversation that  happened.  It went something like this. John, the  man who came with Clara from New Westminister addressed the table generally  about how hot East Indian food was.  Clara looked at Polly (from Indonesia)  sitting across from her and said, "It's  very good isn't it?" Polly nodded and  saidj "Yes, I think having this ethnic  lunch is a great idea and I look forward  to it every morith."  John said something about how hot the  food was.  Clara said, "Do you come here every  month?" Polly said, "Yes, I live right  around the corner." Clara then told how  she had come from New Westminister and  how this was her first time.  John said something about how he guessed  East Indian's liked their food real hot.  Polly said that she loved the food and  that it was actually quite similar to  the "food in Indonesia where she grew  up. Clara asked Polly where Indonesia  was in relation to India.  John said he didn't see why they  had to have their food so hot. Polly  and Clara ate in silence for a little bit while John went on about how  hot the food was.  After a while Clara asked me* did T  know any place in the city that had  Spanish meals like this. I said, no I  didn't. Polly perked up and asked,  .Were we talking about Spanish. Clara  said yes, she was just thinking it  would be nice if there were Spanish  lunches somewhere so that she could  practice her Spanish.  Polly got really excited and said,  "Do you study Spanish? I take Spanish  at the senior's centre." Clara said yes  she'd been studying it a while and  she was taking it now at a community  centre but that her course was being  changed from Saturday afternoon to a  weekday night, so she was going to  miss it because she dqesn't go out at  night.  Polly said, "You should come and take  it with me. Our class meets in the  afternoon." "Oh" said Clara,  "where?" "At the senior's centre on  Dunsmuir and Richards," said Polly.  Clara's voice fell, "That's downtown  Vancouver." "Yes but it's very near  the SkyTrain. Do you live near the  Skytrain?" "I live two blocks away,"  said Clara. Come and take Spanish  with me, it won't take you any time  at all and we can call each other  up and practice speaking Spanish on  the phone." "I've always wanted to do  that with someone," said Clara.  At this point John may have said  something about how hot the food was,  but Clara and Polly were busy writing down their names and telephone  numbers for each other. When John  went to see if there was a second  helping Clara took the opportunity to  let us know that John was not actually  a friend of hers but just rented a  room in her house and had asked if he  could come along. Polly left soon  afterwards after promising to call  Clara.  Clara turned to me and said that she  thought foreign languages were so  interesting. I said that I regretted  not having kept up my French* She said  it's never to late to learn. I said  that I had learned that from listening to her and that she' was a great  inspiration to me. Her face lit up.  She said she loved to inspire people.  With that she gathered up John and  headed back to New Westminister.  lJgK&-$^R FURNITURE Dwchl  hSnhk  250   MoRTftERW   AVE.

They weren 't  content to jibe at my naked state,  they  had to search me. A skin search, aye,  it sounds ridiculous, but it 's true.  Republican POW, Armagh Gaol.  Since 1982, the women imprisoned in  Armagh jail have endured more than  2000 strip searches.  While the British government claims the  strip search practice "is a security  measure, it is clear Republican women  prisoners are being strip searched as  part of a campaign of extreme sexual  harassment and psychological torture.  Armagh jail is located in the centre of  the Protestant/loyalist town of Armagh  in Northern Ireland. Builti in 1790, the  prison is a forbidding granite structure  that has held many Republican women,  jailed for opposing the British presence  in Ireland. The jail has been the site  of many political prisoner's protests for  recognition as prisoners of war, and for  even marginal living conditions for the  women held there.  The practice of strip searching is the  British government's latest attempt to  break the spirit and determination of  the Republican women prisoners. These  women endure a high degree of repression  and psychological torture inside the  prison, because, through their beliefs  and actions, they are a threat to British  rule in Northern Ireland.  Although all prisoners are under constant  threat of strip searching and harassment,  it is the remand-prisoners who suffer  most from this system. Remand prisoners  have not been convicted of any crime, have  not been tried for their "crimes", but  are punished solely on the basis of their  political identities.  Like the oonvicted prisoners, many women  on remand find themselves in jail as a  result of the "supergrass" system of  paid perjurer's evidence. Under this  system, one perjurer is offered  financial rewards, a reduced sentence  or even freedom and a new identity,  for incriminating a number of other  individuals. One supergrass may offer  evidence to incriminate as many as  forty people as a result of police  bribery and manipulation.  Through the lengthy wait for trial,  remand prisoners have the Diplock (no  jury) court system to look forward  to. Their case is heard by one judge  who, more often than not, is willing  to accept the evidence of one well  paid perjurer rather than indisputable  defense evidence.  (Between 1976 and 1979, the average  aquittal rate for contested jury  trials was 58 percent while the average aquittal rate for contested Dip-  lock trials was only 19 percent.)  Most remand prisoners are held for six  months before they come to trial, and  many are held for two years. As remand  prisoners must make weekly court  appearances, they are strip searched  when they leave the prison and when  they return to it.  For the duration of their court appearance and in transport to and from the  prison, they are constantly under the  scrutiny of the guards, and at no time  come in contact with the public. There  are clearly no security reasons for  this kind of harassment.  While it must be obvious that the strip  searches are detrimental to the  prisoner's physical and mental health,  the procedure is best described by the  prisoners themselves:  We are. told to go into the cubicles  and strip. A curtain is fastened across  the cubicle at about waist height to  the floor.  You are always in view of  the prison staff who sometimes number  as many as ten.  When you are naked,  your body from the ■  waist up is visible to all the prison  staff in the room. You are told to  hand over your clothes. These are taken  away and searched.  While you are naked, you are asked if  you have your peiod. If you have, you  are forced to remove your sanitary  protection. A paper bag is provided  for your tampon or towel.  The bag is  opened and the contents are examined.  Your body is inspected.  You are told  to turn completely round so as no part  of your body is left unseen...  Anyone with long hair is ordered to  gather her hair up in her hands and hold  it on top of her head. This makes- the  whole sordid affair seem like a slave  trade market.  When the strip searching  is finished,  clothes are returned and  we are allowed to dress.  In spite of claims by prison officials  and the British government that strip  searching is necessary as a security  procedure; nothing but a small phial  of perfume and a five pound note have  been found since the practice was  started four years ago.  These items hardly constitute a risk  to national security.  Skin searching serves only as an attempt  to demoralize and humiliate the prisoners. Women endure verbal abuse as well;  one prisoner experienced the degradation of the screws counting the stretch  marks on her body during the search.  .The prisoners' are particularly enraged  by being strip searched while menstruating. One woman explained:  When I got back to the reception area,  I was told to remove all my clothing.  I had my period and I had to remove the  sanitary towel and all of my clothes  were searched.  Then I was bodily  searched although I was naked and anyone  could see I was not hiding anything.  I  was told to lift my feet one at a time.  My hands were turned over so the screw  could see the palms.  After the screw had finished searching  my clothes and me,  she then started to  search the cubicle.  I was left there  standing naked.  When I did get my clothes back,  blood  had begun running down the inside of my  leg.  I got dressed as quickly as I could  as I just wanted to get back up to the  wing to get a shower although I had  taken- one that morning before going to  court.  I felt really dirty.  Refusal to comply with the order to strip  is certain to bring about severe punishment, including loss of privileges,  remission and visits, and also periods  of solitary confinement. Describing the  kind of treatment resistande to the  searches brings about, POWs in Armagh  jail said,  One young girl had a towel thrown around  her head to act as a blindfold while  approximately ten to twelve wardresses  threw her onto the floor and proceeded  to remove all her clothing, while she  was pinned down in a spread eagled  ■ fashion.  Prisoners are strip searched after returning from the exercise 'yard', the  hospital or doctor, and particularly  after a visit or trip to court, although  the prisoners are under heavy guard at  all times.  Regardless of the age or the condition  of the woman's health, all prisoners are  forced to undergo this torture.  Remand prisoner Patricia Moore is awaiting trial on the sole evidence of 'super-  . grass' Angela Whorisky. Before her arrest  last year, she was under treatment for  an illness that prison doctors were May 1986 Kinesis   11  INTERNATIONAL  informed about. Once imprisoned her  treatment was stopped, she was unable to  keep down food, lost weight and was in  much pain. After her health deteriorated  due to this neglect, she was transferred  to Musgrave Military Hospital in Belfast  for 'treatment', and was returned to  Armagh no better. Within two weeks (early  March 1986) the state of her health was  so bad, prison officials returned her to  Musgrave for an operation. She was taken  back to Armagh on the same day  as her  sugery, and was immediately strip-searched.  Jacqueline Moore, a remand prisoner at  Armagh was strip searched after the birth  of her daughter. Because prison rules  allow babies to remain with their imprisoned mothers for up to a year,  Jacqueline's baby was with her in Armagh.  Jacqueline explained,  Despite my medical condition,  I was  strip searched.  Once naked I attempted  to cover my breasts with my arms as I  was embarrassed with my breasts leaking  milk. I was ordered to remove them to  facilitate the warder's inspection of  my naked body.  Even Jacqueline's baby was not exempt  from the harassment of strip searches.  The baby was body searched-an average  of 26 times each week when she was taken  from the cell blocks for fresh air in the  yard, to mass or a visit to the prison  doctor.  also endure an average of 115 body  searches each month, and face psychological torture in the form of solitary  confinement up to eighteen hours each  day, their sleep being disturbed  every fifteen minutes and by frequent  cell searches.  Like all remand prisoners, Martina  Anderson and Ella O'Dwyer are unconvicted of any crimes, yet are-being  punished as if they were already  condemned.  In the last few months and on International Woman's Day, pickets have  been held at Brixton prison to support Martina and Ella in their struggle against the British 'justice'  system and in their isolation from  their nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  Many groups have taken up the campaign  to abolish strip searching.  This year's International Woman's Day  marked the seventh year that women '  from all over Britain and Ireland have  travelled to Armagh to express their  solidarity and support for the women  held there as a result of their determination to free Ireland from British  imperialism.  A March 8th picket outside Armagh drew  more than 500 supporters, including  members of the Republican community  Strip searches in Armagh  The following statement was written by a prisoner at Armagh, and first appeared in Strip  Searches in Armagh Jail, published by the London Armagh Group.  heard one word of kindness since leaving the house,, dragged out, shoeless  and coatless, by a mixed force of Brit-  Your guilt is not established at your  trial. Mine was established at birth..  I was Catholic, and worse, I was republican. I refused to make any statements, I refused to speak one word  from my arrest. Four days later, I became another victim of the Paid Perjurer System — a man identified me  as being a Republican activist. They  told me they knew I was innocent of-  the charges, but were delighted at  this opportunity to 'stitch me up'.  I maintained my silence, knowing that  within the week I would join those  women whose very existence denies  every atrocity inflicted by their oppressors. I was charged, and taken from  the court to Armagh.  I remember a tremendous feeling of  unreality about my arrival in Armagh.  Detached, I entered the prison, thinking  wryly of my next forthcoming encounter  with British rule. Photographed, weighed,  I was brought into the 'reception room'.  Eight screws were present, standing  silently, waiting, hoping to see another  one 'break'.  Then the dreaded words: 'RIGHT -  STRIP'. I was hustled into a small cubicle and slowly began to undo the buttons  of my shirt. 'This can't be happening to  me, it can't'. But, of course, it could.  Item by item, I removed my clothes,  each article taken from me and scrutinised. I knew there was no need to search  me. I had been in custody for over a  week,! hadn't  seen  one   friendly  face,  ish troops and R.U.C. As I stood there  naked, I grasped my ideals to my heart.  They weren't going to succeed. I would  NOT break. I thought of the women  waiting for me on the wing. They'd  gone through this. I thought of the  Blanket Men of Long Kesh - they'd  been forced to remain naked for five  YEARS. I thought of my sister, sixteen, and dreaded this ever happening  to her. I thought of my mother's face  the morning of my arrest, trying so hard  not to cry, and her shouts of support:  'Don't let them break you, love'. 'Be  strong'. And of her face that  morning in the court - ashen, aged,  prepared to run to Armagh for the next  decade - just as she's run to various jails  to visit my father and brother.  And I thought of all the women,  striving everywhere to achieve their  freedom. Aye, I thought of a lot of  things. Anything to block out what  was happening to me. I was stripped  naked to confront me with their control, to enforce on me my own vulnerability, to degrade me. But they were  not going to succeed. I saw my nakedness as an indictment against them.  They thought my womanhood would  Serve to help defeat me. They didn't  understand that the strength of ideals  cannot  he stripped from one's   mind.  It is not only women held in Northern  Ireland who face strip searching as a  form of political repression. A strong  support movement is under way for Irish  Republican prisoners, Martina Anderson  and Ella O'Dwyer, currently held on  remand  in Brixton Jail,  London.  Since their arrest  last  July,  Martina  and  Ella have been awaiting their  trial which is  scheduled for May.   These  women have been subjected to 800 strip  searches in that time,  no less than  fifteen searches each per month,  and  sometimes as many as forty seven.  They  prisoners relatives,  and  150 women  from Britain:   Irish solidarity  groups,   the SWAPO solidarity campaign,  Latin American,   anti-apartheid and  miner's support groups and many others.  During the picket,  protestors shouted  messages to the women inside.  The  prisoners managed to break through a  barricade erected by the prison screws  in one of the cells to wave to the  demonstrators and also succeeded in  rattling the cages loudly enough to be  heard by people outside the prison.  These small gestures of solidarity  would undoubtedly be rewarded by solitary confinement for all the Republican prisoners.  The following day,  a protest of 5000  people in support of the Armagh women  was held through the Falls Road,  a  Nationalist district of Belfast.  The  demonstrators marched under the close  scrutiny of scores of RUC   (Royal Ulster  Constabulatory police force)  and soldiers of the British army. Heavily  armed RUC lined the length of the  march;  helicopters and saracens   (armed  and armoured cars) patrolled the Falls,  flexing their military muscles.  It was a peaceful march.  Unable to defeat the Irish Republican  people in their struggle against the  British occupation of Ireland, Margaret Thatcher's government has turned  the prisons of Northern.'Ireland into  one of the most vicious and deadly  fronts of the war.  The women of Armagh have recently  undergone a new phase of British  prison torture.  In mid-March,   the  women were moved to Maghaberry Jail,  the empire's newest high tech,  high  security prison.  They will be joined  there by male prisoners from a number  of prisons throughout Northern Ireland.  This new institution boasts a range of  surveillance systems which will undoubtedly escalate the degree of repression  already faced by Republican prisoners  of war.  The British prison authorities are now  threatening to step up the levels of  harassment involved in the strip searches.  They say at any time,  random searches  will be introduced and internal searches  will become part of the strip search  procedure.  But in the face of such repressive measures,  the prisoners remain strong:  We live within the reality of the situation here,  and all at some time will  endure the practice. We will be forced  to strip naked,  to suffer the humiliation of parading our naked bodies before  our gaolers—and we struggle to maintain our self respect and dignity when  the deed has been carried out.  And while the British occupying forces  attempt to crush the will of individual  Republican prisoners, it is that spirit  of resistance in the Nationalist people  which is unbroken.

Falls Road, Belfast 12   Kinesis May 1986  We have been governed by Social Credit  governments for the past 11 years. During  this time every issue and sector has been exploited to gain an ideological edge and advance  a political perspective. That ideology has brought  us the.highest unemployment and the lowest  welfare and minimum wage rates in Canada, cutbacks in health, education and social services  attacks on labour which have been internationally  condemned, absolute inaction on native land  claims and mega debts.  While British Columbia lurches from one  manufactured confrontation to another our government keeps busy setting up new targets. When  it is not sowing division and fear it seeks to distract  with the ultimate corporate carnival, Expo, a six  month side show which will leave us with a $550  million debt.  Social Credit policies and inaction have cost  almost every British Columbian something and  have cost some virtually everything. Eleven years  ago life wasn't like this in British Columbia?  Do you remember?   The photo-graphic essay which borders this month's  provincial supplement seeks to illustrate that poverty  defies neat categorization. In the short term poverty  means you spend your time in food bank line-ups but  in the long term poverty means you have no choices,  no expectation and almost always no hope for a change  in the future. Poverty is the single most devastating  effect of the Social Credit's restraint policy. In British  Columbia poverty has increased by 73 percent since  j Food Bank Bags per Month  I MHR Grocery Vouchers per Month  1982  1983  1984  1985  237,000 British Columbians (including 83,000 children) on  welfare are living below the poverty line. Single women on  welfare live, on average, 66 percent below the poverty line.  In 1984-85 B.C. cut income assistance by approximately  $100 million.  Expo 86's  astronomical  bottom line  by June Patterson  Expo '86 opens its doors this month.  B.C. Premier Bill Bennett expects the  17 million turnstile ticks at the gate  will put B.O; on the map. of the world,  so that business can pull its economic'  socks up. But this mega-project has a  mega price tag that will impact oh all  of us. The $1.4 billion expenditure  from provincial and federal governments,  corporate sector and foreign governments directly for the site is only  part of the picture.  •It is ironic that with the world's  fair theme as transportation, we can  expect traffic chaos. Vancouver city  officials project rush hour traffic  from 8 am to 8 pm daily. Peak projections per day are between 100,000 to  150,000 visitors to the site. And the  skytrain has the capacity of moving only  8,000 people per hour. Expo organizers  are still short an estimated 3,000 parking spots of their projected need. Demand will of course push the price of  parking up. After 9 am you can park at  the Sandman.Inn for $10 per day, and  you can expect to pay as much as $14  per day in other locations.  •The Advanced Light Rapid Transit (ALRT)  system was brought on line in time for  Expo, to help with the tourist crunch  and as part of the transportation theme.  An argument can be made that an urban  area of this size needs a mass transit  system, but it wasn't the cheapest system possible.  In a letter to Burnaby Mayor Bill Lewarne,  in April of '85, then B.C. transit minister Grace McCarthy explained that Sky-  train would cost $1,037 billion. $275  million of that is paid in the form of a  grant from the province, and $155 million  is paid through a lease back scheme  with companies and banks for the actual  vehicles. That leaves $607 million that  we're paying for now through a graduated mortgage.  A graduated mortgage balloons out over  the years so that it doesn't have to be  paid for all at once. The ALRT mortgage  has a 30 year term. The payment in the  first year is $49 million, and payments  go up 4 percent each year, so that in  the 30th year, the payment is $159 million.  If you add it all up, it totals over $4  billion.  •You pay for Skytrain at the fare box. The  ticket price for one zone just went up  at the beginning of April from $1 to $1.15.  Transit plans call for gradual fare  increase to cover costs. The transit levy  on you hydro bill also went up in April  from $1.60 per month to $5.30 per month—  that's over 400 percent. Grace McCarthy  says that 231 percent increase is directly needed for Skytrain. So you pay $63.60  per year now for transit through the hydro  levy, and that brings in $28.5 million.  There is a transit tax on gas in the lower  mainland which is 95 cents per litre, and  this collects $14 million. There's also  a transit tax on non-residential property  which is going up from $8 million to $28.5  million, this year.  •B.C. Transit has hired 120 more drivers  for the Expo period. They plan to have  every working bus on the road during peak  periods at an unspecified cost. They are  adding new urban and suburban routes, park  & ride destinations near Skytrain, and  plan to run the Seabus more often on Sundays and holidays.  The Vancouver city finance director says  $2.1 million of city spending is directly  attributed to Expo and the Centennial.  $1.3 million of that went to more wheelchair ramps, side walks, tree planting,  pole painting; $100,000 for increased  garbage collection; $50,000 for new neighbourhood parking regulations and $150,000  to enforce them. More health inspectors  were needed for food on site.  There are also indirect civic costs in areas  where the dates were moved up so that  some projects could be done in time for  Expo. We're looking at up to $6 million in  road improvements, including more left turn  bays and road surfacing. It also includes  $3.2 million for widening Cambie Street  which involved property acquisition. The  new Cambie Street bridge cost $52.7 million; $10.5 million of that was paid for  through tax increases.  The Parks board wanted an extra $120,000  for Expo, and they got $60,000 from the  city, and that will pay for things like  more garbage cans and extra planting in  the parks. The Finance Director estimates  that an extra $200,000 in Expo-related  staff time isn't accounted for.  •Police estimate crime and calls to  the police will increase by 33 percent  because of the worlds fair. Forty-  eight new police have been trained  and hired; 15 of them will be on  site and 33 off-site, but the off-  site police will also be responsible  for VTP duty. That leaves very little  left for extra neighbourhood policing.  Approximately 150 extra civilian  police have been trained for traffic  duty. The province has paid for training and Expo has given the city a  million and a half dollar grant for  additional police. There is already  an influx of hookers from the U.S.,  and community"workers fear there  could be gang wars over street  corner territory. There is also a  projected increase in the number  of transients on the streets, and  the drug trafficking is expected  to go up.  •The 20 percent increase in the lower  mainland population during Expo  means there will be an increased demand on health services. Expo has  three clinics on site and they expect  to deal with 45,000 people with  everything from sprained toes to  cardiac arrests. They have only emergency nurses and ambulance attendants  on site. Fifty private doctors locally are going to take referrals and  St. Pauls and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) expect to see 15 percent  of the Expo on site patients which is  6,750 people. St. Pauls expects to  have a 20.percent increase in emergency admissions and VGH projects a  12"percent increase. Only one staff  increase will result from this: St.  Pauls is hiring one more emergency  physician. Hospital budgets have  not been increased. The director of  Public Relations at VGH, Peter Waltoi  says they have not calculated an increase in health services that happen off-site, only on-site; but they  figure they can handle an emergency  influx.  •There have been an estimated 700  evictions of low income residents  from downtown hotels and rooming  houses, according to the Downtown  Eastside Residents Association.  So far five evicted people have died.  Two who were evicted from the.  Ambassador; one who jumped from the  from the Lotus and jumped under a truck;  and one who starved himself to death  after being evicted from the Patricia.  You cannot say anyone was killed by an  eviction, but the city's medical health  officer Dr. John Blatherwick says the  stress of forcefully moving the elderly  can contribute to despondency and even  death. The City has paid $40,000 so  far to relocate tenants.  •Expo needs 15,000 employees. Most of  these will be for minimum wage jobs  and they've only been able to hire  9,000 at the time of printing. Internal Expo sources say fair organizers  fear as many as 50 percent of the  minimum wage employees will quit  within two weeks of the fair's  opening because no amount of train-  continued next page May 1986 Kinesis    13  Pictured above is a sterling example of corporate interest in  Expo 86 and in the other photo the refuse from a newly  renovated downtown eastside hotel. Over. 700 people have  been evicted from downtown hotels as a result of Expo. In  July 1983 under Bill 19 the Socreds dropped protection for  tenants living in hotels and rooming houses. The provincial  government currently provides no funding for non-profit and  co-op housing. In 1978 the Socreds took responsibility for  seniors' housing.

'Expo organizers want to match the  number of employees with volunteers.  They want 15,000 volunteers and  have 9,000 signed up so far.  •Actual spending from Expo '86 Corporation has been revised at $698  million. They project $373 million  N in revenue, leaving a $325 million  deficit. The B.C. government has  promised that all provincial revenues  from lotteries until 1989 are committed  to paying for Expo. Even though Expo is  a crown corporation, they have not yet  provided disclosure on their finances.  Expo president Jim Pattison has ignored  an order from tourism minister Claude  Richmond to disclose the finances. It  is impossible to tell whether Expo  Corporation or the B.C. tourism budget  has paid for expenses such as advertis^  ing.  •Even though the number of Expo visits is  30 percent over target, Expo sold more  early discount tickets than they expected.  So it is estimated that ticket revenue is  only up 3 percent from their 1985 projections. Since Expo hasn't released their  ticket revenue, this cannot be verified.  •The B.C. Economic Policy Institute has  done an economic analysis of the impact  of Expo. They estimate a direct cost to  the province of $1,037 billion. Revenue  to the province, including tourist spending, they estimate at $484 million. So  they figure that the bottom line for  Expo is a $550 million loss.  •What's the real cost of Expo to you?

Megaprojects  or  megawaste?  by Adrienne Peacock  The Social Credit government continues  to construct castles in the air, at  the expense of social and economic construction. What to them are castles  to beguile the voting public are, in  reality, megaprojects, built at the  expense of jobs and funds for social^  programs.  The common denominator in all of these  megaprojects is huge government expenditures for very little economic return.  The lowest common denominator? Megawaste. The money has come from general  revenues, reducing what's available  for underpaid workers and single parent familids—women make up a large  percentage of these groups and they, .  in particular, are .hurting from this •  diversion of provincial monies.  Many of these projects make little  financial sense and even the business  community has to search hard for semblance of sense. But the fact is,  megaprojects and their lead time fit  very tidily into a four to five year  election strategy, and people respond.  Bill Bennett has honed the art of  election-by-megaproject to an art.  He knows it has the shimmer of the  spectacular.  Recent megaproject developments outside the Lower Mainland include the  Revelstoke Dam, the Cheekeye-Dunsmuir  high voltage transmission line, the  Northeast Coal project, and the Coqui-  halla highway. And now Bennett is promoting the $3.2 billion Site C Dam on  the Peace River. If built, Site C  will be the most expensive dam ever  constructed in B.C.  Past megaproject developments in B.C.  have been shameful disasters. The  Revelstoke Dam, for instance, provides  hydro-electric energy which is entirely surplus to B.C. needs, yet the interest alone amounts to at'least $250  million every year. Luck, rather than  planning, allowed B.C. Hydro to market much of this surplus energy because of one of the driest years on  record in the Pacific Northwest states.  Apparently B.C. Hydro has been selling  this energy below cost, hamstrung by  the fact that it has small returns or"  no returns. B.C. Hydro Chairperson  Chester Johnson claims that sales to  the U.S. are profitable but remains  silent on just how profitable they  are. (A recent CBC special stated  that B.C. Hydro receives about 2.5  cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) while  the cost of building the dam amounted  to at least 3.0 cents per kwh.) With  this kind of track record, the prospects of building yet another dam  strictly on speculation seems a fairy  tale indeed.  Here's more on track records. The  Cheekeye-Dunsmuir transmission project was supposedly undertaken to  . meet growing electricity needs on  Vancouver Island. Two 500 kV transmission lines from Squamish to the  Dunsmuir station near Qualicum were  constructed in the face of fierce  opposition over its high costs, both  financial and environmental. The  project, in retrospect, is just another  variation on the mega-waste "theme.  The net loss to the province is estimated at nearly $300 million, a loss  borne by the people of B.C.  Another case in point — about $700  million of taxpayer dollars were  .spent to develop Northeast coal. Political expediency urged the project  onstream at a time of declining Japanese demand for coal. Again, mega-waste.  H.N. Ha'lvorson, ai respected mining consultant, had warned that development  of the heavily subsidized Northeast  coal project would jeopardize existing  coal towns in the East Kootenays. And  as it stands now, Northeast coal is in  direct competition with this region,  where about 800 jobs have been lost since  1981.  The hidden agenda for the Northeast coal  development appears to have been entirely  political. Government documents leaked to  the NDP caucus in 1981 showed that senior  civil servants in the Ministry of Industry and Small Business,, and private consultants advised the government to delay,  rather than expedite. Their advice went  unheeded. And here's the Social Credit  boondoggle served up in cold economic  terms: each job created in the Northeast  coal development was' at a cost of one  million dollars.  On another deflating note, plans for non-  traditional jobs for women at the new  northeast coal town of Tumbler Ridge seem  to have bit the northeast coal dust. A  check of the Union of Opera'ting Engineers  membership shows only 84 women out of  1,150 members in the bargaining unit—a  mere.seven per cent. And even that seven  continued next page 14   Kinesis May 1986  When Premier Bill Bennett took office in 1975, the provincial debt stood at $4 million.

As for the Coquihalla highway project,  the tab is in at over $500 million and  what's this? The government intends to  make it a toll highway—a first for  Canada., No environmental impact assessments were done and biologists predict  it will have a devastating effect on  wildlife. Again the rationale was a  political need rather than any sensible  examiniation of alternatives.  But these expensive political manoeuvrc-  ings pale beside proposals for the Site  C Dam. The $3.2 billion project will rer-  suit, in job losses and the destruction  of an area 18 times the size of Stanley  Park, consisting of some of the most  productive farmland in B.C. There is  every likelihood that the California  utilities are setting up long-term  electricity contracts in similar manner  to the Japanese with Northeast coal.  California may be encouraging the  development of several energy alternatives  so they can get the power at a fire-  sale price.  For British Columbians, Site C will, for  starters, mean much higher Hydro rates.  And while the U.S. economy may benefit,  we will be paying one million dollars  for every job created at Site C—these  jobs will be temporary. At the end of  construction, Site C will provide only  25 permanent jobs while hundreds of  permanent jobs in agriculture, recreation,  and forestry will be lost forever.  As much as it lacks election appeal,  there's a good case to be made for energy conservation as an alternative to  mega-building. A recent study by Bonneville Power Authority in the Pacific .  U.S. comparing the economics of conservation and nuclear power plants showed  that a conservation program in Washington State would generate two jobs per  million kwh of energy conserved". By  contrast, a nuclear construction program, when repaid by ratepayers, would  reduce regional employment by 30 jobs.  In the same study, a comparison of conservation and large coal-fired power  plants showed a similar economic pattern. There is every reason to believe  the relationship would hold for hydroelectric megaprojects.  B.C. has a legacy of making regrettable  power deals with the U.S. In 1961, the  Social Credit government sold 30 years  of power from the Columbia River to  the U.S. for a paltry lump sum payment  of $273 million. Although touted as a  bonanza at the time, it turned out to  be anything but. The money didn't  even cover the cost of building the  three dams required to provide the  power as agreed under the Columbia  River Treaty. The Pacific Northwest  states, however, received about  $500 million worth of new capital  investment and one estimate suggests,  $300 million annually in new  production and foreign exchange benefits thanks to cheap B.C. power.  If Site C is built, it will mean  jobs for Californian workers, but  high interest payments on Hydro debts  for us. Comparing current prices paid  by U.S. utilities for hydro exports  to B.C. Hydro's estimates for power  production at Site C, we will lose  about $109. million a year—and this  doesn't include lost job opportunities and agricultural land.  Sad to say, reasoned alternatives  are given little shrift by this  government. If and when B.C. needs  energy, there are low-cost alternatives to Site C. First and foremost,  and not to be fobbed off as naive,  there's energy conservation. The  Northwest Power Planning Council, a  U.S. federal agency, found the  equivalent output of ten Site C  dams could be gained through conservation programs at an average cost  of 2.3 cents per kwh. The lowest  cost estimate for Site C power, putting aside environmental costs, is  about 4 cents per kwh. In addition,  conservation programs would create  six times more jobs than Site C for  each dollar invested. And these jobs  are more likely accessible to women.  Further, there are 54 sites in B.C.  where small hydro dams can generate  power at less cost than Site C and  eight sites where small hydro projects are urgently needed to replace  high-cost diesel plants. Developing  these sites would promote an independent and innovative community-oriented approach to power development.  As well, they would be much more  labour intensive than mega-projects,  creating an estimated 2,500 construction jobs.  And there are other alternatives. But  in power development, as in other  areas of development, the Social  Credit government is manic for mega.  But when it comes to social programs,  their scope is mini. Welfare benefits—  reduced for single mothers and persons  under 25. Public assistance rates for  foster care, the disabled and unemployed—frozen since 1982.  It's time for.some perspective and some  decency. What this suffering province  needs now is a government with a mega-  heart.  Uniting the  People of the  Squamish Nation  by Debra Jacobs  The Indian Act legislation was drafted in the late 1800's by the fathers  of Confederation. Bill C-31—"An Act  to Amend the Indian Act", was the  first attempt since 1951 to make any  significant changes to the Indian  Act. The major principles of C-31  sought to eliminate discriminatory  provisions on the basis of sex. In  June 1985, Bill C-31 was given Royal  Assent and became law.  When Section 15(1) of the Constitution Act came into force on April  17th, 1985, sexual discrimination in  the Indian Act was made potentially  unconstitutional. The intent of Bill  C-31 was to strike a balance between  collective and individual rights and  afford recognition of Indian First  Nations' control over membership.  Aboriginal leaders and chiefs across  Canada have repeatedly said that only  First Nations have the authority and  jurisdiction to determine citizenship  in their respective Nations.  There are 26,000 people who had their  •rights restored by the Indian Act  amendment. A further 60,000 first generation descendants have also been  affected. Many thousands of others  lived under this discriminatory legislation, throughout their lives.  The,intent of this article is not to  provide an analysis of the amendments  or to discuss the political implications, but to share from a personal  perspective the implementation of  the C-31 principles at the grass  roots level of the Squamish Nation.  I am a community-based woman with  strong ties — Ta nayap en Skwxut mesh  stel mexw  — to my dear friends, my  people and the land.  My work on citizenship issues focuses on keeping Aboriginal communities  together by healing and uniting. This  is as a natural part of my growth  and fulfillment as an Aboriginal woman.

In 1820 before the  white man came, the population of my  tribe was over 20,000. Today, our  population is around 1,600 with an  average of 30 births per year.  In 1880—"the power over Indians"—  went from the province to the federal government under Section 91.24 of  the British North America Act. Indian  band membership and status became subject to the Registrar's Office in  Ottawa. As well the definition of "Indian"  was laid out in the Indian Act.  By the early 1900's the economic land  base of our people was being taken or  "cut off" by the the Crown, with the Queen  of England's permission. In 1921,  after 11 years of deliberations by  our Elders and Chiefs, the Squamish  tribes recognized they had to reach  beyond reflection to a recognition  that problems existed; the 16  Squamish tribes, and their resources,  amalgamated.  In July, 1985 (following the Indian Act  amendment) the Squamish Nation formed a  Citizenship Committee and gave it a  specific mandate to provide a course of  action and develop through consensus  the "Squamish Nation Membership Laws".  To the Squamish Nation, and other First  Nations, membership is the reason for  their existence. Membership preserves  the cultural and political integrity  of the people and determines who shares  in the responsibilities and privileges  of the Nation.  We have always been free in our hearts  to feel and be Aboriginal. I have always felt that I am Squamish. With the  General Membership's decision in July  1985, we decided to make way for the  expression of that freedom. No legislation or constitution can pass onto us  the heritage that is ours by birthright.  We can recognize that which has always  existed and in the process right that  which has been wronged.  To the individual, membership means the  right to belong to and share in the  way of life, the resources, the future  and to participate in the collective  decisions of the Nation.  From the onset of the Squamish Citizenship Committee, it has been the aim to  go through a natural community process  of designing and implementing our membership system. Membership is generally  based on custom, inter-tribal considerations and practicality. Much of our  customs and traditions are oral and not  written.  The Committee opted to work with an  educational three phase citizenship program. The ultimate goal of the Committe'e  is to have the membership laws adopted by  all People of Squamish Nation. The laws  will be finalized only after lengthy  community deliberations.  The job of developing written laws is  not an easy one and it has meant that  many Members of the Nation have had to  shed paternalistic assumptions and assim-  ilationist ideas adopted through the  Indian Act membership system.  During phase One of the program a series  of workshops Were held on: The Indian  Act Changes to Membership—an Analysis;  Band Membership Rights; Status Rights;  Nations Administrative Structure; and A  History and the Current Nations Governing Structure.  The intent of the series was to bring  together the current membership and most  importantly the returning members. Squamish people who had been away for years  and even decades attended the sessions.  During the first phase, the Committee also  held weekly sessions to give information  on the federal government's re-instatement  scheme and its criteria for eligibility.  Currently the Committee is implementing  phase two. Four community members were  chosen and now have the task of conducting  interviews with the general membership  and administering a survey questionaire.  The results of the survey, interviews and  historical research will form only the  basis for a discussion paper. The paper  will be circulated to our membership  prior to the community forums where  we will discuss all concerns and  issues, regarding membership.  The committee members have been  through a training period which included sessions on traditional forms  of communications by our Elders and  language teachers and what membership laws really are and optional  systems or methods. The four members  are each responsible for specific  territory and it is anticipated  that we will gather a large cross-  section sample from our membership.  Concurrently, a team of researchers  are compiling historical documentation on our Nation.  Phase three is the finalization of  the membership laws, their implementation and administration. The final enactment or adoption of the  codes will be done by a majority  of our Nation's population.  I have given you a brief overview  of the Squamish Nation's Citizenship  program. Other Nations, are approaching their membership concerns and  responsibilities in various fashions.  The bottom line has to be that  Nations are looking forward to the  future of the unborn seventh generation.  Conversations  on labour  by Patty Gibson and Esther Shannon  Kinesis invited representatives of four,  unions which have a large number of  women members to discuss the status of  women in the trade union movement in  B.C..  Our panel was comprised of:  Jane   Woverton, British Columbia Government Employees Union (BCGEU); Mary La  Plant, Hospital Employees Union (HEU);  Marlene: Hill,  International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU); Susan Croll,  Telecommunications Workers Union (TWU).  The discussion was moderated by Susan  O'Donnell, who presently works with the  B.C.  Human Rights Coalition and who has  also been active for many years as an  educator for many B.C. trade unions.  There have been a number of provincial  government moves to reduce trade union  powers and freedoms since 1982; chief  among these are the following:  Compensation Stabilization Act and Programme (CSP): Introduced in 1982 and  since extended indefinitely,  CSP has vir-  tkully eliminated   meaningful collective  bargaining in the public sector. Both the  BCGEU and HEU, among others, bargain  under the provisions of the -CSP.  Labour Code of British Columbia: First  introduced in 1973,  the Labour Code governs trade union certification,  collective bargaining and the rights of all B.C.  unions.  The Code has undergone a number  of amendments since its introduction, all  of which have made trade union  organizing more difficult and increased employer power.  Susan:  Women are generally poorer than we  were a few years ago. We're not able to  get the wage increases we were able to  get a few years ago for the majority of  women because there is massive unemployment. There is also less interest in  work for two reasons. One is technological change. More and more jobs for  women are various kinds of computer-  work—entering data, pulling print  sheets, work that is really mundane and  boring. The other thing is that B.C.  is a resource based economy and a lot  of women have never worked in so-called  non-traditional jobs. There's even less  continued next page Unemployment across Canada  " oct''*^^^M  SEPT'85  NFLD  17.7% V/^;4*  17:1%  P.E.I.  sill   118%  9.4% ,  1  N£.  12.2%  P!§N2.2%  3  N.B.  •8i?$it~13,4%" ,Mi:TM-l  ^^^fe-^2.1%  gi  QUE,  ^fe^^^^^^^s  J|||P%I.O% '"  ■al  ONT.  7.1%  7.4%  §  SASK.  6.9%  6.8%  <s  continued from previous page  opportunity to do that now. Before,  more women were trying to get into some  of the trades, and now you just don't  think about that mostly because of unemployment .  In terms of economic issues and how they  have affected the women in our union,  first of all, in the last TWU contracts  we've settled for very low wage increases.,  On top of that women in the TWU have  been trying to win across the board increases and still haven't been able to  get that. We win it at convention as a  policy but when it's time to negotiate  with the employer, it's out the window.  All the old cliches we've heard about.  When it's tough times, women's issues are  the first to go — you think 'well, that  can't be true'. But we're still trying  to win this one.  I think the main problem is that there's  not enough education with the members  about the importance of across the board  increases. Also, there aren't enough  women in the union leadership and there's  not enough women wh6 are really strong  on this issue and women's issues in general to really make a good fight. The  men have a vested interest in a certain  way, they're making quite a bit more  money than us, and so they can think,  'what the hell, I'm happy if I get four  percent.' Four percent, $130 a day,  their base rate, isi.'t bad, they're not  getting four percent on $80, an operator's  wage.  Jane:  BCGEU has had one across the board  increase in all the time I have been  in the union which is many years now.  That time the increase was so small that  it really didn't make much of a difference. Other than that it's always been a  percentage increase although, like TWU,  the policy of GEU is to go for an across  the board increase.  Since our 1983 strike a lot of things  have happened in the BCGEU. In my own  local, the membership has dropped from  2200 to 1600 which is primarily as a  result of resignations and contracting  out. Another phenomenon is to take work  which was previously contracted out and  bring it in house but  with no additional  staff.  What it's meant is a great change in the  environment; it's meant isolating one  person for a good part of the day, doing  data entry and that previously wasn't  their job. A lot of people at MHR have  been hired for their skills in dealing  with people, and that includes the clerical staff. Initially people were interested in this change. But after about a  week they were just going crazy and bored  out of their minds with data entry.  After 1983 the BCGEU membership was  very demoralized, our meetings dropped from having 300 people out to a  meeting, to six. People who were  very active in Solidarity either took  severance and left or just put their  energies elsewhere. There are also a  lot of strong women in our local who  just are no longer active.  We're in the midst of bargaining now  and it doesn't look as though we'll  end up with very much that will benefit women. It doesn't look like we'll  end up with" much of anything in the  way of an increase. We've been held  down quite a lot in the last three  years.  About the only thing in our 1983 contract that I think has benefited  women is that our auxiliary staff, if  they are working regularly, can be  converted into regular staff. Previously, people would have just been  left at a temporary status for a  long time. The government, however, is  allocating less and less money to hire  auxiliaries so there are fewer and  fewer people who get that experience  and get into the system that way.  Mary:  I guess our biggest complaint over the  last couple of years is the Compensation Stabilization Program (CSP). The  CSP has totally destroyed collective  bargaining. It has reduced the right  to negotiate a contract in good faith.  If a contract is negotiated the employer will agree to it but he knows  full well that when it comes in front  of Mr. Ed Peck, the CSP Commissioner,  it's going to be rolled back.  We have people in the long term care  facilities now that are making $6  and $7 an hour and we can't bring those  wages up any higher because CSP says  they're in excess of the guidelines.  CSP does not help the B.C. economy.  Jobs have been reduced; we've had  people laid off, we've had a lot of  beds closed in B.C.. We've had a number of new wings being constructed  in different hospitals but they've  never been staffed. We've got people  on waiting lists—patients that are  waiting for surgery or waiting for  admission to a hospital and they  cannot get in because of bed restrictions .  Funding cutbacks also means less staff  to care for patients and that means  more injuries on the job. We've had  so many appeals on both WCB and long  term disability over the last three  or four years that it's just absolutely astonishing. A lot of these injuries could have been reduced had  there been more staff. For instance,  if you have only one person trying  to move a patient, you have more work  related injuries.  Our contract was up at the end of  March arid we've just gone through  an extremely long, 56 month contract.  Our contract has been, greatly reduced  over the last few years and we want  our members to catch up with cost of  living. We've got to take a stand  for our members, and try to get a contract that provides a satisfactory  standard of living.  The concessions employers are asking  are astronomical. They're trying to  make us take a ten year step backwards. Our vacation package is being  reduced. They are trying to take  away our sick time. We've got 15 percent of our members unclassified since  1980 and what they're trying to do is  say anyone who's not classified from  1980 will get no retroactivity.  They're also trying to make our members  pay for 50 percent of benefits such  as medical, dental, long-term disability.  Another concession demand is to try  to take away our right to binding tribunal. And they're not even offering  any increase in wages. They want us to  strike. Thait seems to be the bottom line.  The concession demands amount to about  a.20 percent cutback in our members  benefits.  Marlene:  There's another piece of proposed legislation that affects the garment industry  which just needs a little more work put  into it, and that calls for legalizing  homework. It doesn't just affect the  garment industry, it's also for all the  computer terminals that they're looking  forward to putting into everybody's home.  Leading from this takes me to the  amount of part-time work that people  are forced into which basically lowers  everybody's standard of living and  women are affected by this more than  anybody else.  With reference to the technological  change, the other aspect of that is  piecework. Nobody wants to call it  that. Nobody wants to call repetitive  motion or data processing or keypunching piecework—but that's what it is.  We're all monitored. They know how  many pieces we can put in that machine.  They know when we go to the bathroom.  They know how many times we blow our  noses every day and  it's a whole new  area of stress. And it seems that  unions don't want to call it for what  it is, it's piecework.  Coming from the garment industry, I si  the ills of piecework.  Garment workers are 99 percent women,  predominantely first generation May 1986 Kinesis   17  f JjmrtSw*TM  J  Between 1980-85 in B.C. full time employment declined by  19,000 jobs, Part time positions grew by 34,000 jobs. Only  17 percent of part time jobs were involuntary in 1980: by  1985 38 percent of part time workers wanted to work full  time, but were unable to find full time jobs.  Between 198385 MHR income assistance and child protection cases increased by more than 50 percent. In. 1984 the  B.C. Association of Social Workers identified disturbing  increases in the number of:  • children coming into care  • reported cases of child abuse and family violence  • common assaults, including domestic assaults, some lead- m  ing to murder/suicides  • attempted suicides  • incidences of emotional and mental illness t  • requests for home makers  • requests for child care workers  • children and pregnant women who have not eaten for up  to three days.  «children attending school without having breakfast or lunch.  continued from previous page  Canadians and the majority don't speak  English. Talk about monotony, they work  on the same seam for all of their  lives. If they start out sewing a cuff  that's what they're going to sew for the  rest of their days. The only difference  between the piecework system in the  garment industry, compared to the other  industries, is that it's measured and  there are allowances for people to go to  the bathroom and there are incentives  built in.  Whereas with tech change in the other  industries, such as people working on  computer terminals, its not there yet.  The boss who's overseeing them makes no  allowances for the fact that they're a  human being and not a machine. Not that  the garment manufacturers recognize the  operators as operators but in the union  factories we have been successful in  bringing the standard of living up and  getting add-ons to accomodate for a  better wage, a much better wage than it  was six years ago. Six years ago people  were making no more than $4 an hour in  a union shop. Now the operator is getting $11 an hour.  The garment industry has tripled in size  in the past three years and we are trying to organize in an industry that is  extremely difficult to organize. The  changes in the labour code aren't so  devastating as the changes in the attitudes and interpretations of the labour  code by the Labour Relations Board.  Today unfair labour practices are not  unfair labour practices as we used to  know them. Now, if you have an employer  that fires a worker prior to filing for  certification, you don't have a hope in  hell of getting that person's job back.  Prior to certification the only unfair labour practice that can be won is  is a firing. Intimidation, threats, you  you name it, they can do it.  Our experience of organizing is nuts.  We win a decision, they appeal it,  we win the second appeal, they appeal  that. One day we were at the Board  for our hearing on our organizing at  Marjorie Hamilton and the employer  maintained that he didn't know it was  a hearing, but we got him to agree that  it was a hearing and to be there the next  morning at 10 o'clock. Well, the next  morning his partner was there with a  letter of appeal of the decision from the  night before. Appeals and appeals and  appeals. Their aim to just to make us run  out of money. To bust us.  Quite frankly, it's a real dilemma,  whether or not to take anything  to the Board but we don't have any  choice when it comes to certification.  Susan O'Donnell:  In listening to what you're saying,  it's clear that management knows that  this is their government. They are on  a roll. Management also has all these  new issues they're coming up with to  save dollars right across the province.  For instance, sick leave abuse.  Management calls the people in and  they say 'well, you're sick. I hope  it won't happen again.' This is a  form of discipline against a right  that is grievable. And they're doing  this with every single benefit. Ten  years ago when I started teaching—  out of 100 grievances, 90 were  grievances over the intent of the  collective agreement. You'd say to  management 'We think this clause  means X, and management would say 'no,  we think it means Y' and that would  be your grievance. Now, 80 percent  of grievances are direct contract violations by management. Stewards go in  and say 'The collective agreement says  this, you blew it,' and management  says, 'so what?'  Susan Croll:  We grieve and (grieve and grieve in  our local, which is the operators  local, over discipline in terms of  sick leave. We've had people disciplined left, right and centre for  what management considers to be 'too  much absenteeism'.  This does not unify people, it splits  people up. What management is able  to do is pit worker against worker.  In certain areas where people are  working on speed-ups, if you're absent, then the person who usually  sits beside you begins to feel rer  sentful that they're carrying your  share.  I agree with you that the employers  are on a roll. They know they've  got a supportive government and they're  going as far as they can with it. The  telephone company is just amazing  right now with its internal propoganda,  which is a subtle form of union-  busting. They use scientific management programs, desk programs and quality circles and what they are trying  to do is change their image. They're  trying not to be so confrontational  with business agents, union offices  and shop stewards. But, they also  try to isolate shop stewards from  the membership and sneak in through  the back door.  Marlene:  One of the things we missed is the  Employment Standards Act. Just look at  the Employment Standards Board where  the officers are now human rights  officers, employment standards officers,  labour relations board officers. They  wear three hats. Those people are not  human rights officers. They may have been  good employment standards officers but,  because of all the loads they're carrying, they're not good at anything anymore. And who gets screwed but the  worker.  Another issue is when an employer violates the Employment Standards Act. In  order to win that case at Employment  Standards, each and every employee whose  rights were violated must sign a complaint. Before, one person in the shop  could sign a complaint and everybody  would get what Was due them.  Now, you  have to have everyone sign it. It's outrageous. That is really- relevant for  organizing and what's taken place since  1983.  Mary:  We just finished going through a grievance, it almost went to arbitration,  over a worker having a cup of hot water  without paying for it in one of the  hospitals. And this was going to be  taken to arbitration. Arbitrations are  very costly. The employers know it and  they figure that, 'we're gonna get you.'  They might admit in the end that they're  wrong but they're going to fight it the  best way they can.  One other thing I meant to say is about  job-sharing and part-time work. I don't  agree with part-time work and I don't  agree with job-sharing. Part-time workers  don't get an equitable wage and don't  have a "good standard of living. Same with  job-sharing. You're taking one full-time  job, that somebody could, possibly, live  on and you're reducing it.

That's one  of their take-  a-ways. The other thing the government  is trying to do is exclude a lot of  employees and I think their main  aim is  to exclude about 2,000 employees from the  bargaining unit. BCGEU is in better  shape than it has been in years; there's  been quite a change in the union leadership and in the paid staff. I'm a lot  more optimistic about the union at the  moment.

Native Land Claims - History  of an ongoing siege  by Pat Feindel  Spikes in cedar trees, Haida leaders  blocking loggers, protesters hiking  into the Stein Valley...When non-Indian  people like me think of native land  claims in B.C., the images that spring  to mind are those from recent conflicts  on Meares and Lyell Islands, or in the  Stein Valley. The last few years have  seen native land claims make headlines  on a regular basis, linked with environmental concerns in a battle  against an unrelenting provincial  government.  Recently I found myself musing over  the latest high profile struggles  and wondering—why do non-Indian  people hear about land claims only  when trees are involved? I suspected  there was more to the question of  aboriginal title and rights than saving trees br petroglyphs, and set  out to find out what. Easier said  than done.  If you don't know exactly what aboriginal title or aboriginal rights  mean, you are not alone. It isn't just  because you haven't kept up with the  news stories. If there is one thing  I learned it is that hardly anybody  agrees on what the phrases mean.  Bill Wilson of the Musgamagw Tribal  Council describes them this way: "The  term aboriginal title is an expression,  a non-Indian expression, a legal  expression of how we feel about our  land...it is on the basis of title  that all-the other rights flow." Yet  the courts and governments of Canada  have been hard-pressed to clarify  what aboriginal title means or who has  it, and various governing bodies have  been debating the question on this continent for over two hundred years.  Historical Origins  Native people's history began long before the arrival of white settlers in  North America. But the conflict over  aboriginal title as we know it traces  its roots to early white settlers'  assumption that .lands on this continent were theirs for the taking.  Native people gradually found themselves displaced and dispossessed;  their traditions and economy disrupted.  They were to learn that the white invasion would demand a vigilant defense  of their land and culture for a long  time to come.  In year 1763, upon hearing of Indian  uprisings and resistance in the New  World, the British Crown (King Charles  III) issued a royal proclamation which  recognized the aboriginal rights of  Indians to "occupy and use their tribal territory". It forbade colonialists  from further settling or purchasing  land considered to be governed by  aboriginal rights, and defined where  those areas were—mostly in the west,  outside existing colonial territories.  Purchases of such lands was to be  carried out exclusively by the Crown  and explicitly required the consent of  the native occupiers of the land.  From that time, colonial traders and  settlers were to acquire Indian—occupied land only through purchase or  agreement by treaty, negotiated by a  representative of the Crown.  When a British colony was established  in 1849 on Vancouver Island, Governor  James Douglas served as both governor  of the colony and "chief factor" of  the Hudson's Bay Company. Douglas  negotiated several treaties on Southern  Vancouver Island, in which native  people gave up title to large areas of  land they had used in exchange for  compensation payments and exclusive  rights to smaller portions of land.  Some retained rights to fish and hunt  on lands surrounding their "reserved  land".  However, as white settlement in B.C.  increased, and the race was on for  access to the valuable resources—  among them gold, timber, coal and other  minerals—treaties became an expensive,  legally complex and politically unpopular way for the British to continue  securing land for settlers and profiteers. Concurrent with this racism  against Indians gained wide social  . acceptance, and the policy began of  establishing reserves with no compensation and no signed treaties. While  Indians had some say in determining  the boundaries of their reserve areas  in the mid-1800's, later many of these  boundaries were arbitrarily changed  and reduced.  From 1866 the B.C. government took the  position that Indians had no legal  title to ^their lands and that there was  no legal need for treaties—a convenient  position which has remained relatively  consistent up to the present. Except  for some parts of Vancouver Island and  the northeastern corner of B.C., no  B.C. land is governed by treaties  between Indians and government. The •  basis of most current native claims  in B.C. is that the tribal groups never  relinquished the lands they occupied  (as was required by the Proclamation  of 1763), and so the claim of ownership  by the Crown or those occupying the  land is illegitimate.  In 1971 B.C. joined confederation. Federal policy towards Indians then was to  recognize aboriginal title and to negotiate treaties which would terminate or  extinguish native title (ie. ownership)  through purchase and define land-use  rights. The British North America Act  j also gave the federal government legislative responsibility over "Indians and  land reserved for the Indians". However,  negotiating treaties for lands already  in dispute would have been difficult  without cooperation from the province,  and B.C. refused to recognize aboriginal title or rights. In addition, one  of the terms of B.C.'s joining confederation was that the federal government  would undertake responsibility for any  debts and liabilities of the province  at the time of Union. One can begin to  imagine the legal and political tangles  these provisions and conflicting policies might engender.  From confederation right up until now,  federal, provincial and native governments have continued to disagree over  aboriginal title and rights.  Federal/Provincial  The province of B.C. has consistently  maintained its refusal to recognize  native land title or negotiate with  native groups. It has recently emphasized that, even if the courts decided  that legitimate claims to land do  exist in B.C., B.C. is not responsible  for the costs of granting such claims,  since they would have been liabilities  existing in 1871, which the federal  government took over. The costs to B.C.  of admitting aboriginal title could  be enormous, involving loss of Crown  land, loss of controlled access to  resources, and compensation required to  resource industries for loss of licenses, not to mention compensation to  native people for lost use of the land  and its resources.  Federal policies have varied over the  years, but largely due to pressure  from native groups, the federal government has recently grown more sympathetic  to the liklihood of legitimate claims  that must be seriously addressed. How  they should be dealt with, however, has  been a question of some debate, and  positions have often changed with the  political direction of the wind.  An amendment to the Constitution Act  in 1983 asserted protection of aboriginal and treaty rights including  "rights that now exist by way of land  claims agreements or (those that) may  be so acquired". Minister of Indian  Affairs, David Crombie, recently stated  he thinks that "aboriginal title  likely exists in various areas ef B.C."  but the federal government does not  accept automatic responsibility for  the costs to the province of conceding  titles. Consequently, Crombie has urged  B.C. to revise its hard line position  and participate in a three-way negotiating process with native groups.  With this kind of foot shuffling going  on, one might guess that the terms of  any negotiations between native groups  and government bodies might be unclear.  Indeed they are, and Crombie recently  released the Coolican report which  addresses issues involved in aboriginal title and proposes government guidelines for negotiations. (Living Treat-  extensive negotiations over land boundaries, land uses, resources, and self-  government. Knowing this, many tribal  groups with pending land claims have  taken action to protect lands which fall  within the areas they claim. The  Socreds recently ended a moratorium on  logging of disputed areas by issuing  new licenses to log, so conflicts have  flared up particularly where logging  and development have threatened to permanently damage the environmental,  historical and cultural value of the  land—Meares and Lyell Islands, and the  Stein Valley.  In the case of Meares Island, members  of the Nuu Chah Nulth tribal council  succeeeded in securing an injunction  against further logging until the  issue of title over the land has been  determined by the courts.

The report deals specifically with  . "comprehensive land claims"—those  which come from aborginal groups who  "have never signed a treaty with Canada and whose rights have never been  extinguished in legislation or 'superseded by law'." Most claims from B.C.  fall into this category.  Native  While federal and provincial governments continued their debates, this  century has seen Indians organizing  inter-tribally in B.C., across the  country and internationally to fight  for recognition of land title, self-  determination and social justice. As  early as 1888, the Nishga spoke on  aboriginal title before a Royal Com-  What we don't like about the Government is their saying this:   'We will  give you this much land. ' How can  they give it when it is our own?  (David MacKay)  How did the Queen get the land from our  forefathers to set it apart for, us?  It is ours to give to the Queen,  and  we don't understand how she could have  it to give to us.  (Charles Russ)  The Nishga pressed their assertion of  title again and again...in 1913, 1915,  1916, until in 1973, the Supreme Court  of Canada finally made a landmark  judgement for non-treaty Indians. In  the case referred to as the Calder  decision, three of seven judges ruled  that aboriginal title to Nass River  Valley lands still existed for the  Nishga. (Three other judges ruled if  any title had ever existed it had been  extinguished in the colonial period.)  Though this did not resolve the issue,  the recognition of title by three  judges of the highest court was seen as  a significant and hopeful development  for native people. No B.C. claims have  been settled since that judgement,  though the Nishga have continued negotiations.  Completing land claim negotiations will  clearly be a long and complex business.  It will involve years of court ruling  to establish title and to determine who  is responsible financially, as well as  fought for the same protection in the  South Moresby area, and while failing  at the court level, succeeded on a  political level in forcing the issue  between the federal and provincial  governments. They have embarassed the  Socreds, stalled the logging, and  brought their concerns to International  attention.  Other resources, too, have been the  subject of conflict.  In the Kamloops area, thirty-six  Indian bands (representing three  different nations) have filed suit  against CN Rail to prevent construction  of double tracking along parts of the  Thompson and Fraser Rivers, where it  would interfere with fishing areas  traditionally used by the bands. An  injunction has been granted to prevent  any construction before the case comes  to trial.  Meanwhile, one of the most important  and far-reaching comprehensive claims  for aboriginal rights in B.C. will  come before the courts later this year.  Forty-eight hereditary chiefs (among  them eight women) of the Gitskan and Wet'  suwet'en tribes have filed suit against  the B.C. government for over 20,000  square mile6 of Crown and privately  owned land in the Hazelton area. They  assert sovereignty over the land and  control over all its resources. They say  they have lived in and used the territory "since time immemorial" and have  continued to the present to own and  exercise jurisdiction over the territory  and its resources in accordance with  their own laws and practises. In the  interim, they have filed a "lis pendens"  which functions as a notice to all  property owners that the true ownership  of the land is under question.  Preparations for this claim (as for  most others) have gone on for many years.  Tribe members have undertaken to map  all the trapping and hunting routes used  by their ancestors, to record the laws  they live by. They have held meetings  with non-Indian people living in the  area to reassure them that the natives'  intention is not to evict people but  to live in harmony enjoying their true  rights, sharing and using the land for  the benefit of all those who live on it.  This will be a precedent-setting case  and is sure to include fascinating courtroom testimony. It will be heard in conjunction with the case of the Nuu Chah  Nulth regarding Meares Island.  These time-consuming and expensive battles are mere skirmishes in the larger  protracted struggle for a clear resolution of the position of native people  on "Canadian" soil. Nevertheless, they  are all founded on the same questions of  original ownership and control over the  use of the land and will inevitably  affect the long-term resolution of aboriginal rights.  Because of the province's refusal to negotiate, much of the contest between those  with conflicting interests has occured on  the land itself or in the courtrooms.  The pressure is on...on the province to  come to the negotiating table, on the  federal government to bear the costs. It  is on non-Indian people as well, to  become informed and support the struggle  of native people with as much understanding of its origins and meaning as we can  gain.  Native .people in B.C., on the whole, are  not interested in selling off title or  rights for compensation, but in securing  a land base from which to build a strong  future for themselves in whatever ways  they choose. The outcome of these struggles stands to determine not only the  future of native people, but future  relations between all Canadians and  native people.  The astonishing thing is that the drive  to assimilate native people, whether by  draoonian or liberal measures, has never  succeeded.  The native people have clung  to their own beliefs, their own ideas  of themselves, of who they are and where  they came from...their refusal to be  assimilated is a triumph of the human  spirit; it is to be celebrated not  deplored.

That worries  me. I don't see women coming more into  the forefront within unions and it's  been a long time since this issue was  brought up. It didn't start with the  affirmative action changes in the constitution at the B.C. Fed or the CLC.  Women have been talking about this for  a long time. We haven't socked those  guys out of their chairs yet and when  is that going to happen?  Mary:  At HEU, the last three people we have  hired as staff representatives-, have  all been women. When we were looking  at the applications, their qualifications happened to be the best.  Susan O'Donnell:  I think HEU is unique. They've made  conscious decisions on affirmative  action, without calling it that,  and worked very hard, education-wise,  with women in the union.  Jane:  I think in my union, the aftermath  of solidarity was so devastating  that people still haven't returned  to the same level of commitment, or  even interest, in our union. So many  of our staff were given notice,  about 600 in the Lower Mainland.  That was such a destructive move—  people being given notice that  wasn't based on anything, not seniority, nothing. And although that was  withdrawn, the damage was done.  Mary:  We've just taken seven straight  strike votes around the province and  we've had the highest turnout and  highout percentage of strike votes  ever. The turnout was just really  fantastic. To me, that's almost a  sign of the times too. The CSP and  collective bargaining is the critical  factor for HEU right now. The CSP is  impossible.  facing your  deal with  What are the critical  union and how can your  these issues?  Susan:  The critical issue for us is definitely technological change. A few  years ago they started to bring in  the tech change at a rapid rate in  terms of operator services — now they  are just putting on the final touches.  Centralization is also where its  affected a lot of operators, who are  women. There's an office in Cranbrook  slated to close. The office in Nelson  went, an office in Williams Lake is  gone. A lot of times women just aren't  in a position of saying, 'okay, I'll  move to Vancouver', or wherever so  they are out of a job.  The way the tech change is going right  now a lot of the men who used to be  fairly skilled workers, are seeing  their jobs are changing. A lot of the  work they do now is very similar to  what a clerical worker does. Sitting  in front of the terminal and entering  data and pulling something out of the  printer and so on. If men don't support operators in terms of equalizing  the base rate when the telephone company does say, 'okay, 5,000 people  are being laid off and we're going  to negotiate a collective agreement.'  And then they say, 'Now, let's do  some job evaluation here' and they  are going to evaluate them according  to clerical jobs. Not according to  their past jobs.  One of the things I would like to see  my union do is to develop an alternative telecommunications policy. A  union is only as strong as its members  and I see a lot of division and apathy  going on with unions. This would accomplish two things. It would create a way  for members to be involved in the union  and with each other.  If we mounted a campaign and went out  and talked to members about the  actual work they do and about how to  change what they do to give better  telecommunications service people  would actually be in touch with each  other. Secondly, we need such a  telecommunication policy. Everyone  knows about what telephone deregulation has done in the States. Well  deregulation is coming soon to  Canada. All of us should be asking  a lot of questions about that process. I mean, why do we have to pay  an arm and a leg to talk to i  on the telephone whether it be «  the street or across the country.  After all, it's the telephone company  that says talk is not cheap.  Marlene:  For instance, in the garment industry  women will work 7 days a week, 12 hours  a day. They punch in from 8 to 4,  punch another card from 4 to 8. There  are employers who will only pay the  white workers' overtime and the Chinese  people get paid no overtime.  The critical issue facing women is tech  change. And the other critical issue  facing workers is that we have to rec  ognize we're going to have to help ourselves. We cannot wait for any government to change or wait to  vote one out to make the changes  we need in the workplace. We're going  to have to do that by ourselves and for  ourselves. We cannot expect anybody  else to do it, whether it's a Social  Credit government or an NDP government.  We have to be able to stand on our feet  as labour.  Mary:  I guess my final comments would be that  our members are concerned about work  jurisdiction like the practical nurses  jobs that are displaced to a lower-rated  position. There's concern over job security—whether or not they're going to  have a job. I didn't touch on that before. The other thing is it has been  said that there's going to be 300 or  500 more layoffs in the industry. Where  is that going to go for the people of  B.C. In our negotiations campaign we've  got a button and a slogan 'I'm Standing  My Ground'. If every union member wears  that and says 'I'm stariding my ground  against concessions' that is the union  saying 'Look, we're here for a fight,  dig your heels in, boys, because here  Marlene:  I don't have all the answers but one  thing is the employers have become  smart. They've got together. The  unions have to do the same.  A few years ago unions in B.C. had a  totally idfferent view of themselves.  We were number one in Canada, we had  the highest rate of pay for a long  time.  Unions have traditionally worked on  their own. You know, 'I don't need  you, you don't need me. I'm a big  boy. I don't have to talk to that  other big union'. We have got to stop  this. We're not such big unions anymore.  The employers have got one over on  us. We have lost the unity that we all  speak about. We've just become lazy.  There's nothing to stop us from standing up and saying, 'Goddamn it, we're  the same worker, we have rights and  we want you to listen to us.' May 1986 Kinesis   21  • Between 1981-86 tuition fees for B.C. universities increased more than  100 percent.  • Provincial government allocations for student aid were reduced from  33 million in 1982/83 to 2.8 in 1984. B.C.'s student assistance program is •  the worst in Canada.  • By Feb. /85—8.5 percent fewer teachers were working in the public school  system; 2,458 teaching positions were cut.  • By 1984 40 percent of elementary and 20 percent of secondary classes  were oversized.  • As a result of cutbacks the number of B.C. school districts which offered  adult basic education courses dropped from 27 in 1983 to 20 in 1984.  • According to The Politics of Canadian Public Schools a child on welfare is  67 times more likely to be a slow learner.  Growing  support for  education  by Tami Roberts  The Social Credit government appears  to be bending slightly to public  pressure in recent funding allocations  for education. It is not, however,  nearly what is needed to begin to restore the system after years of devastating cuts. There are few dollars  trickling slowly into the system.  The Socred fund for excellence, amounting to 110 million dollars, is to be  allocated in the 1986/87 year. It is  only a third of the over 330 million  dollars the government has cut from  education budgets since 1982/83.  School boards, colleges and universities must make application for money  from the fund. It is not going to be  given directly to boards or institutions as increases in budgets, instead  funds will be allocated by the provincial cabinet on the basis of 'merit'.  The government has provided little  information on what criteria will be  used when evaluating the worth of the  applications. Their merit criteria has  come under fire from almost all education groups. Because the money is  directly allocated by the cabinet,  there are obvious fears that partisan  factors will influence the funding  awards.  "It means that school boards and institutions are bowing and scraping,  beholden to the government to obtain  the scarce dollars." said John Waters  of B.C.'s College-Institute Educators  Association (CIEA). "Allocation of  education dollars by the provincial  cabinet completely undermines elected  local school boards and the ministry's  own staff," said Chris Taulu, parent  coordinator for the Defend Education  Services Coalition (DESC).  Proper and long-term planning for the  system cannot be done under this system of funding, as there is no assurance of money in the following years  to continue new programmes.'  When the fund was first announced in  February, Premier Bill Bennett stated  that the fund was intended to be used  for what he termed "new and creative  initiatives in education". As it turns  out, most of the 42.35 million dollars  already allocated will be used to cover  inflation, teacher salary increments  and the increasing interest payments  on loans made to college and university  students.  "It's absurd to talk about excellence  in education, when the very core essentials, of education are in a state of  extreme deterioration." says John Waters  of CIEA.  One of the most interesting allocations  from the fund for excellence has been  the March announcement of 6.15 million  dollars to buy new school textbooks. In  the 1985/86 provincial budget, 22 million dollars was allocated for textbooks. When it was only half spent, the  cabinet froze the fund. Now the allocation announced from the fund is being  called "new and additional" money.  "They had to allocate some money for  new textbooks, said Chris Taulu. "The  new curriculum, made mandatory by the  governmenty came to the teachers without the needed textbooks. They had to  pay for the books, or withdraw the  curriculum."  Other allocation's were dollars needed  to follow through on previous government decisions. $1.5 million will be spent  on the merger of BCIT and PVI, a supposed  "cost saving measure" announced last  spring. Most of the additional allocation made to student aid will pay for  the government costs of an all loan  programme announced last spring-  Where does a 'restraint' minded government find the 110 million dollars it  allocated to the fund for excellence?  According to John Waters, "The fund is  nothing more than a repackaging of  dollars that existed somewhere else, and  were cut. This gives the government the  opportunity to issue multiple press releases and make several announcements to  make it look like they're spending a lot  more money than they actually are. There  is no opportunity to develop 'excellence'  in the system.as it is funded now, it is  just another example of how the government thinks that if they repeat a word  or phrase enough, it will become a reality."  The weakening of the government's policy  of slashing education budgets may be  an election ploy but it is also giving  organizations incentive to continue  the battle with renewed optimism.  "The members of CIEA," said Waters, "will  be finalizing plans to consolidate some  of their resources to form a provincial  union. This will enable us to bargain  on a more equal footing with the employers." (colleges and institutions).  The Capilano Faculty Association last  year agreed to an increased workload to  avoid layoffs. According to a recent  survey done for the association by  community organizer Margaret Birell,  the increased teaching load has drastically affected the quality of education  students receive.  "It's been a disaster, said Birrell,  The increased load has definitely  affected the quality of education, as  the instructors have more grading to  do, they are turning to quizzes and  yes/no exams. They have less time to  spend with their students on a one-to-  one basis, and are frustrated. It will  definately be an issue in this year's  negotiations." V^PSJw  Bargaining between school boards and  teachers is becoming increasingly heated,  as boards find that they don't have the  money to even pay negotiated salary  increases, and are demanding more and  more work from teachers.  "Parents are not complacent, "says  Chris Taulu. "As I meet with them, I'm •  finding that the cuts are affecting a lot  more children." She said that, more and  more parents are getting involved and  attending board meetings.  Post secondary students, through the Canadian Federation of Students, are focussing  efforts on the upcoming provincial election. "We are doing everything that we  can to make sure as many of our 65,000  members as possible are on the provincial  voters list," said Marg Fartaczek of the  Canadian Federation of Students.  "We will be outlining the record of the  current government to our members, and encouraging them to vote for candidates  who support education. We are going to  the community as well, to ensure that  everyone knows that this government does  not support education, and that education  spending benefits the whdile community."  The Defend Education Services Coalition,  made up of teachers, students and support  staff from all sectors of education, is  also preparing for the next provincial  election. The group is coordinating  briefing information for candidates,  will sponsor candidate's workshops,  and will coordinate community events  to highlight education issues.  Whether or not the Social Credit  government will respond to public  sentiment and increase education dollars is not certain. What is certain  is that public support for education  is continuing to grow, and that there  are organizations that will continue  to make education an issue for the  B.C. government. 22   Kinesis May 1986  The B.C. housing record  Health  system  in crisis  by Esther Shannon  •Vancouver's Reach Clinic, a neighbourhood  health centre, has its budget reduced by  27 percent, Sept. 1983  •Health care user fees/hospital user fees  increase from $7.50 a day to $8.50 a day,  acute care charges go from $11.50 to  $12.75, a visit to the emergency wards  increased from $4 to $10, Sept. 1983  •provincial government increases hospital  budgets by two percent when inflation is  running at five percent.

The battle about adequate funding for  health care services has been going on in  .British Columbia for many years. The Socred 's have been increasingly reluctant  to meet what they see as the dangerously  cost of health care services. The principle of universality of health care  services in B.C. has been undermined by  premiums, user fees, extra billing and  disparities between health services in  different regions of the province. As well,  many health care system cutbacks have  been borne by those at the low end of  the medical system's totem pole, the nonprofessional health care workers whose  wages and benefits haven't increased in  over four years.  All of the available evidence points to  the fact that health care is not taking  an inordinate share of our financial resources either provincially or nationally.  In B.C. twice as much of our available  wealth (gross national product) is spent  on transportation as is spent on health  Total public and private expenditures on  health care is still a smaller percentage  portion of the gross national expenditure  in Canada than it is in the United  States with its totally privatized health  care system.  It is important to realize that while  health care has been a victim of  Socred restraint, the health system compared to other ministries such as social  services and education, has gotten off  relatively lightly. In the February, 1984  provincial budget when other ministries  were reduced on average seven percent,  health received a two percent increase  largely because health services are such  an important issue to British Columbians.  So what is going on in B.C.'s health care  system? -Ir^^rls  According to David Robert Evans in Hiding  Behind Medicare, Health Care Funding in the  Budget,  a paper produced for the B.C. Economic Policy Institue, medicare costs  and the federal government are being used  as scapegoats to justify tax increases.  Evans says higher taxes are made necessary by any one or all of a number of  factors including:  ill advised and money losing investments  by the provincial government, a compulsion  to squirrel away funds under.cover of  pseudo budgets.and the process of crying  wolf and maintaining public support for  ideologically motivated attacks on public  services by creating the illusion of serious revenue shortfalls.  Evans believes the Health Care Maintenance  Tax, an eight percent surcharge on our  provincial tax which will collect approximately 97 million dollars from BX. taxpayers annually, will actually be directed  to B.C. Rail, North East Coal, or any  of the other government mega projects that  are in financial trouble.  Evans says that "Despite claims of 'cost  explosions' by various political figures,  Canada's medicare programs have achieved a  high degree of stability in health costs.  Evans says that Canada's health care costs  have been in the range of 7 percent to 7 h  percent since the beginning of the 1970's.  The Socreds consistently, Evans's says,  seek to make the federal government the  scapegoat for health care underfunding.  The Health Care Maintenance Tax was proposed to deal with supposed underfunding  by the federal government which the Socreds  say should be fifty percent of B.C.'s  health costs.  Prior to the 1977 revisions of the federal-  provincial government's cost sharing  agreements, when the federal government  transferred funds to the provinces based  on the provinces health spending, it was  common to refer to provincial health  spending as "50 cent dbllars",  Since then however, a new federal-  provincial cost sharing formula, based  on provincial populations and economic  outputs, was initiated.  Under this formula, federal contributions  were more closely linked <6o economic cycles  and the recession of 1982 brought home the  risks the provinces took when they endorsed  the new cost sharing agreement.  Many groups have called for a royal commission on health care spending and planning in B.C. Health professionals,  are growing more and more concerned that  health care has become a political football between competing governments and that  people's health care needs are being ignored  in the process.  The Socred's willingness to blame the federal government, health care workers, people  who 'abuse' the health care system, anyone  available, In fact, permits them to dodge  the task of introducing rational planning  for British Columbians health care needs. ' May 1986 Kinesis   23  ,    I  Who says  we are  discouraged?  by Esther Shannon  The following is a partial list, of what  political movements have organized since  the dreaded November 1983 Solidarity  Sellout—you know the one that was the  death knell for political action and protest in British Columbia.  The death knell myth, that dreaded exit on  the road to political sophistication, has  the rare, and needless to say insidious,  ability to make people believe they are  doing nothing and, as importantly, that  they are doing it all by themselves. The  death knell myth is commonly used by you  guessed it,  the ruling class when they  are bored, or even frightened, by the  constant demand to respond to the people.  It is a simple device which, briefly  sketched, goes like this:  "The people have accomplished nothing and  so they all got tired and mad at each  other and called it quits. You cannot fight  city hall".  We are producing this list because we thought  it said some interesting things about perception and reality and the relative power  of both.  Background:  In July, 1983, the Social Credit government  decided to blow it all in one glorious shot  and so they introduced the now famous te-  straint budget. Prior to this, particularly  in 1982, they had begun to lay the groundwork for restraint. (Compensation Stabilization Program and the Education (Interim) Finance. Bill; both these pieces of legislation  were originally time limited but both have  since been, naturally, indefinitely extended  Following the introduction of the Budget, rep-  representatives from literally every sector  in B.C. mobilized a coalition and demanded  that the government step back. Within this  coalition, although it appeared otherwise,  there was limited unanimity on how far the  government was expected to back off. In  November, when push came to shove, to coin a  phrase, the governmtnt shoved and we all  pushed...in different directions. Still it  might have worked except that some of the  representatives you expected to be there  pushing were actually there shoving and it  took all the other representatives aback  a step or two. And really that was all  that was needed, just a step or two.  Shortly after this the death knell myth became popular. Since there was no longer  90,000 in the streets the people started  hearing that no one was doing anything that  made any difference. Soon after that we  began believing that no one was doing anything and also that nothing was going on.  And in a strange and a growingly perverse  way we are still telling each other that  nothing is going on, that there is no point  to it, that nothing works anyway, and that  the people are all burnt out, disgusted and  cynical.  So, as we said, the partial list, with explanatory notes where appropriate:  In terms of organizing probably the most inspiring actions over the past several years  has been the native people's efforts to  re-gain aboriginal title to their land. Native  organizing on both Lyell and Meares Islands  and in the Stein Valley against government  and corporate exploitation have gained international attention and support and put native  land claims at the head of the political agenda in B.C.. Native people have organized logging blockades, support demonstrations, cross  country caravans and overall have succeeded in  putting the white man's law on trial in provincial courts.  The education sector, under attack since 1982,  has never given up the fight to restore quality  education in. B.C.. Teachers, students, parents,  school boards and the university community have  kept up a steady pressure on the provincial  government and have exposed the Socred\s  education policies. The education community has  assured that the provincial government will  be called to account for its mismanagement  of education.  It would be impossible to complete the  list of new women's groups which have  formed or women's actions which have been  mounted since 1983. But just to give you  some idea: The Vancouver Lesbian Connection opens a new centre for lesbians; the  DisAbled Women's Network (DAWN) is established and hosts first B.C. conference for  disabled women; the Langara Women's Centre  joins the ranks of community college  women's centres; Budget University gets  national attention for its innovative  ) educational approach; Downtown Eastside  Women's Centre survives and opens a bakery. Lesbians Autonomous, a substance  abuse support group is established;  Women's Skills opens its doors, and the  Women's Economic agenda vows to make poverty a B.C. election issue.  The tenacity of Vancouver's prostitutes,  fighting against police power, draconian  anti-street soliciting laws, neighbourhood anti-prostitutes groups, city hall  and the provincial attorney general  deserves our admiration. Prostitutes provide an incredible example of what happens  when women decide they are not moving.  The occupation of Vancouver Transition  House, an eight month struggle, put the  Socreds on notice that feminists will  fight and win the struggle against .  privatization of women's services.  On the labour front new organizing at the  International Ladies Garment Workers  Union; the Hospital Employees Union, in  negotiations after a 58 month contract,  wins massive support for strike action  against the governments Compensation  Stabilization Program. The bus drivers  un-strike  wins public support and contract  demands, and the Women's Strike Support  Coalition is established to organize  support for women's labour struggles.  Action against poverty also makes headlines in B.C.. End legislated Poverty a  new anti-poverty group, if formed and  develops with the British Columbia Teacher 's Federation a curriculum guide on  poverty for B.C. schools. ELP also persuades one provincial politician, NDP-MLA  Emery Barnes, to examine poverty from the  vantage point of a welfare cheque, and  focussed public attention on inadequate welfare rates. The Downtown Eastside Residents  Association organizes housing co-ops in the  downtown core and directs national and  international attention on the Expo evict-  Space is always running out and there are  innumerable actions, groups, conferences  media and cultural events which haven't  been listed. Please forgive us for all  we haven't mentioned.  This partial list brings us back to perception and reality and the relative power of both. There are enormous numbers  of people in B.C. working every day on  organizing for political and social change.  People who have never given up and apparently have no intention of giving up. It's  time we started recognizing the strength  and endurance of these people and their  movements because, truly, what you see  is  what you get. 24   Kinesis May 1986  cartoon by Janette Lush  Wm W?

Walch  On Wednesday, May 28th at 8 pm at the  Vancouver East Cultural Center, the  Saskatchewan Theatre Ballet, a professional dance company will be presenting two dance pieces that are  part of a modern trilogy focusing on  Third World issues. The company,  founded in Regina in 1982, combines  the elegance of classical ballet with  the added energy of ethnic dance,  jazz and theatre to portray a story.  They have played to rave reviews  throughout Saskatchewan and Ontario  and have been supported by project  grants from CUSO and the Canadian  International Development Agency  (CIDA) because of their attempts to  help build a better understanding  of people in the Third World.  The two pieces being presented, They  Planted Money Seeds  and Breaking, the  Silence,  were both written and  choreographed by Robyn Allan. She was  one of the founding members of the  company and currently resides in  White Rock, B.C.  The first piece deals with the poverty, repression and murder of campesinos  working on the coffee plantations of  Central America. It depicts their  poignant and sometimes tragic struggle  for bread and dignity and their  eventual realization that through organization and perseverance, they can  build a brighter future for themselves  and their families. The subject of the  ballet suggested itself to Allan partly as a result of her work as an  economist concerned with global debt  and she was also very much influenced  by her reading of Salvadorean writer  Maritio Arquela's One Day of Life.  It is set to origninal music composed  and written by Carlos Grana, a  Chilean rdfugee persecuted by the  Pinochet regime for his songs of protest.  The second piece, Breaking the Silence,  celebrates the important struggles  that women in all parts of the world-  are involved in. It recognizes our  ability to rise to the many challenges  of everyday life and explores the  role that women from different regions  including Africa, Latin America, North  America and Asia are playing in  society's development.  Breaking the Silence  is made up of  five sections linked by a vigil representing the silent waiting role—  waiting for children to be born, sons  and husbands to come home from war,  etc., that women have traditionally  played. During each vigil, the number  of women standing vigil increases.  Symbolic of the strength generated  through commonality of purpose, and  growing numbers, these women ultimately  find a common voice. It is a dramatic  and moving performance and the strikingly symbolic finale, the title piece,  Quilters are the piecemakers  by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  "Quilting forever—housework whenever!"  Although it is intended as a witticism,  this slogan printed in the program of the  recent Red Cross sponsored Vancouver Centennial Quilt Show gives us an indication of the dedication of the quilters  to their work. Often leading very traditional lifestyles, many of these  women are extremely skilled and take  the time to produce work which has  power, elegance and humour. The coming  together in this exhibit of these  quilters and their works is as much a  gathering of women's energy as any event  within the feminist community.  Stitchery has long been the medium through  which women have spoken of their lives.  While some types of fabric art such as  weaving were frequently practiced by men,  and others such as embroidery were  restricted to women of leisure, quilts  were made by women for their families  and friends, and the art they put into  them did not make them any less utilitarian .  Quilts have always been beautiful to  look at, and rich with symbolism, full  of messages about religion, love, sexuality, death, as well as the imagery  of more everyday life. But despite their  artistic quality quilts have managed to  avoid the recognition and consequent control by a largely patriarchal art establishment. This anonymity has given  quilters a freedom which women working  in other media often lack.  Many of the quilters in the Vancouver  Centennial Quilt Show work in a traditional geometric format, which is not  to say their quilts lack meaningful and  contemporary content. Linda Dennison's  "Coventry Rebornlf consists of  glimmering silk rectangles which for  the artist replicate the glass windows of Coventry Cathedral in England, "itself a symbol of rebirth  and renewal, raised from the ashes  of its predecessor, a victim  of the inhuman violence of the Second  World War." On a different theme,  Bev Neilson, a marathon runner, has  made a quilt called "J-Jock", entirely out of squares cut from runners'  t-shirts, bearing slogans like  "Dairyland Fun Run"or "Lions Gate  Road Runners".  Other quilts offer a single scene  which fills the bed-size space.  Bettina Maylone's "Canoes at Deer  Lake" was inspired by a photograph  taken on a quiet walk in Burnaby  one evening. Jeanne Schotte Tagor's  "Nels is Dreaming" depicts her grandson Nels in applique in the centre  of the quilt gazing out with his  little telescope at batiked versions of outer space drawings he himself has done. Donna Pringle's  "Vancouver 1886-1986" presents a  panorama of the city full of popular  landmarks mingled with personal memories. Even the B.C. Stadium looks  friendly and homey.  On a more serious note, and speaking  to us more urgently is Wendy Lewing-  ton's anti-nuclear quilt, "Sheltered  Lives". Inside sixteen private  bombshelters constructed of fabric  screen printed with excerpts from  Canadian government literature on '  how to survive a nuclear war, human  mm  was written by Connie Kaldor. It's  theme is the realization of women's  potential through the metaphor of  birth. This "birth" is made possible  because, through working together,  recognizing common needs, problems  and is sues, s ilent though can become  a powerful, yet harmonious chorus of  voices.  This innovative production, dealing  with the fundamental issues of oppression and exploitation in the Third  World as well as here in our own backyard, is being brought to Vancouver  as part of a Western Canada tour sponsored by Salvaide. Salvaide is a  national network of committees dedicated  to funding projects in the civilian  government zones of El Salvador, projects in such diverse areas as education,  health care and agriculture. Locally,  our group has been known as "Seeds for  El Salvador" and, in our second year of  work as a collective, we are continuing to organize and sponsor social,  cultural and educational events in an  effort to help the people of El Salvador  build a new, more just society.

In many cases quilters are  indeed the peacemakers. Across North  America this year women have been  making quilts and patches, and in June  of this year the Women's Journey for  Peace will be taking quilts as gifts  to the women of the Soviet Union. But  whether quilts are made for exhibit,  for use at home, or for'political reasons, they remain a special women's  art and an expression of women's voices.

V6K KN4 26   Kinesis May 1986  ARTS  Taking a stand on censorship  by Jill Pollack  Hot.. Wet.  Don't burn yourself.  The tap is dripping.  Words and their meaning.  Context.  I am so tired of people telling me what  to do and what to think around the  question of censorship.  The party line.  The social chatter.  Context.  I may consider something to be an example of objectification and/or violent  toward women, someone else may not.  What to me may be pornographic may be  erotic to someone else.  Judge. Morals.  Options.  Intent.  Context.  What is the difference between pornography and erotica? What is the link  between pornography (fictionalized) and  violence (realized)? I can try to define pornography, not in opposition to  erotica but in relation to itself. I  can arbitrarily  decide to use that word  to mean a non-agreed upon, unequal  power dynamic depicted through the  denial of the individual-ness of a  person or group of people. While  pornography is a common reference to  depictions of certain acts of sex (acts  of power?), I take it to also denote  violence towards and the denial of  women as being individuals- with worth  beyond their usefulness as a commodity  for pleasure/revenge.  Pornography can be manifested through  images or text, with the cumulative  purpose of breaking down social discipline within the individual. This  results not only in psychic damage but  perhaps physical damage as Well. In the  broader sense of the term, I take pornography to mean denial and fictionalized violence in the arenas of economics, politics and.social organization.  Pornography is  subjective and the two  words, hot and wet, make, that clear.  They and other words have been appropriated to the extent that they define  two contexts at the same time. I do  not consider hot or wet to be pornographic terms in and of themselves.  But like other insidious aspects of  pornography, words have shifted  meaning to represent not degree of  temperature of degree of humidity  but states of sexual attractiveness/  excitation.  There is nothing wrong with appropriating words and altering their meaning  for descriptive purposes...at least on  the surface. 'Hot' and 'wet' can be'  considered erotic. Context seems to be  at the crux of the distinction between  what is deemed to be erotic (good) and  pornographic (bad). The whole issue of  distinction/context is so individualized and subjective that, for me, the  problems arise with questions of censorship; especially in the light of  context. The only solution that I can  find is a modified version of self-  censorship .  She moved towards the bed,  slowljy.  Her  breathing quickened in anticipation.

We as a society seem to be interested  in quick solutions and short term  answers. Self-censorship implies an ongoing process of education and (re)-  evaluation. It also entails taking a  stand and ensuring that your individual  opinions are made known, but it does  not deny someone else's rights. You  choose or you don't.  ■BBSS-  LEIGH THOMSON  251-6516  • DRYWALL REPAIR  Self-censorship does not have to be  passive, nor does it have to mean evading  issues. Rather it recognizes the nature  of context and subjectivity. It also  allows for individuals taking individual  responsibility for their thoughts and  actions.  Self-censorship is an imperfect solution  in the face of prevailing and perpetuating social/sexual attitudes, so I  believe that certain restrictions on our  personal freedom do have to be made.  The modification of self-censorship can  take the form of specific legislation  around specific aspects of violence where  there is existing broad social consensus  (some already are in place, such as  murder being illegal—but even here it  is only some  murders which are illegal).  Banning the use of children for pornographic purposes and outlawing snuff  movies are two concrete examples of how  the legal system can set limits without  encroaching upon my personal rights,  within the range of possible enforcement. But I still feel that any law  made around these issues has a double  edge to it. The very people/system that  has encouraged pornography (overtly  and covertly) is then being asked to  regulate restrictions on pornography.  To me, those kinds of laws are "state  of emergency" measures at best and  hopefully, will only be seen as preliminary superficial steps in a long and  complex process.  The sun was out so I was hot.

Edited by Tatyana  Mamanova with the assistance of Sarah  Matilsky. Foreward by Robin Morgan.  Translated by Rebecca Park and Catherine  A. Fitzpatrick. Beacon Press,  Boston,  1984.  In the foreward, Robin Morgan tells us  this book is "Russian women speaking  to us...from Leningrad and Moscow, from  Estonia and Lithuania."  Does she mean Russian immigrants to these  non-Russian countries or does she think  Ukranians, Estonians, Lithuanians,  Kazakhs and others are really Russians?  In her introduction, Mamanova says the  journal Woman and Russia  raised issues  of, among other things, "every nationality." Every nationality is not  Russian, no matter what the Russians  think. (In fact, Russians make up less  than half of the population of the Soviet  Union.) Mamonova goes on to say "...  for most people there is no essential  difference between the names America  and the United States or between the  names Russia and the Soviet Union;  the same difference as between any  other imperialist nation and its  colonies.  In the same way, it does not appear  that many of the stories and articles  were written by working class women.  The matter of class is referred to  only indirectly. For example, in the  middle of a terrible story about the  lack of adequate maternity care,  Kari Unskova tells about how she and  her husband hired a man to refinish  and repaint their living quarters.  He worked for about six months and  was paid thirty rubles plus his  food and vodka. He had nowhere to  sleep and bothered them by working  late into the night. He stole the  necessary materials.  Nadezhda Zotova writes: "In former  times, the governesses took care  of young ladies' education..."  Obviously this applied only to the  young ladies of the aristocracy.  So this book is about women of the  imperialist nation, not the colonies  where life is much worse. It is not  about the working class nor is there  any mention of peasants.  It is somewhat mind boggling then to  read about the difficult lives of  even these women. Some interesting  observations:  • In recent years, besides the 112  days of paid maternity leave, women  can get partial pay for another year  off. There is also a one time award  given of 50 to 100 rubles per child,  but this may only be to Russian  women.  • Single mothers receive an allowance  from the government of 20 rubles a  month. This is enough for one week.  • The food lineups are a constant fact  of life. "Patience, or the willingness to stand two hours in a line,  and preparedness (all Soviet women  carry a net bag to hold unexpected  purchases) are the key. Soviet men  predominate on only one kind of  shopping line—that for alcoholic  beverages."  • Everyone over 16 must carry the.  internal passport. There is also  a work booklet or reference card  from the employer needed to  change jobs or travel anywhere. This  card must contain the formula:  "Politically mature, morally stable",  otherwise the carrier is in trouble.  • A law passed in 1944 and still in  effect separates legitimate from  illegitimate children and frees  men from any responsibility towards  their illegitimate children.  • Motherhood is the only acceptable  role. An amusing example: "My parents  were obsessed with the idea that my  pregnancy and the birth of my child  should in no way alteY their egalitarian attitude toward me and my  sister. I am giving birth, but my  sister had dermatitis..." A different way of saying it: "People who  do not have children are egotists,  living only for themselves and not  for society, and they are, in general,  antisocial elements."  • The family is the primary economic  unit. This is in order to exploit  women more efficiently.  • The inadequacy of day cares is made  up for by the grandmothers who thereby play an essential role in the  economy. In day cares, there is one  nurse and one nanny for every 25-30  children.  • Male homosexuality was made punishable by up to 8 years imprisonment in  1934. Lesbianism is not illegal but  is apparently considered a mental illness.  • A person without an approved job and a  signed work booklet can be arrested  and jailed for he crime of "parasitism".  In the article about prisons, the  reasons given for imprisonment of women  are: parasitism, not having a place of  residence, refusal to receive medical  treatment and "There are also Soviet  gypsies who are in prison for swindling,  pickpocketing, and robbing apartments."  This latter sentence is confusing in  that it is unclear whether the crime  is being gypsies or stealing. The  conditions in prisons are described  as horrific, including poor food, overcrowding and showers only once a  week.  • Women constitute only 25% of the membership of the Communist Party of  the Soviet Union.  • Housework is nearly all done by women.  Wages for housework had been discussed  in previous decades but the idea was  treated with derision by men and the  government.  • Alcoholism is referred to. as a common  male characteristic. A partial ex  planation is given: "A lonely, despairing woman turns to the church,  while as man who has failed prefers  alcohol."  • The dissident movement is sexist,  with the exception of Andrei Sakharov.  • Apart from referring to prostitution  as widespread, there is no discussion  of it.  There is an interesting article on  peace which begins with a play on the  Russian word for peace, "mir", which  also means world. So when the Russian  ruling class says it wants peace, it  might also be saying it wants the  world. The author, Ekaterina Alexandrova,  maintains that an external threat is  necessary to prevent internal revolt.  "The harder life gets, the more often  it becomes a necessary to remind people  about external danger."  No wonder Reagan and Gorbachev seem to  get along so well. From this point of  view it can be argued that it is the  hard-line right-wingers in the U.S.  which help preserve communism.  The implication in the article that  there is no real external danger from  the Americans displays a certain naivity  about the United States. There are  other such oddities as well. Ekaterina  Mironova remarks on the muscular development of American women, whereas we  are trained here to think it's the  Russian women who develop biceps.  The editors write: "Conditions more  favourable to the transformation of  society arose, not in Russia, but in  Europe and the United States...".  Apparently the world is in worse shape  than even I think if they are looking  westward for hope.  There is more in this book that space  precludes mention of. I should say  though that there are some rather weird  stories which only irritated me but  people who are into spiritualism might  really like.  It is progressive that there are finally  a few books addressing the rights of  women in Russia. Unfortunately, without  the inclusion of any discussion of race,  class, serfdom, or imperialism, these  books can be dismissed as bordering  on elitism.  Mamanova writes that the existence of  the journal Woman and Russia  caused  the authorities to start raising  issues of women's rights in the  official press (as well as, of course,  persecuting the women involved in the  journal). She presumably means the  rights of middle-class Russian women.  It did not cause the authorities to  consider discussion of the rights of  peasant women. This is not to dismiss  Mamanova as unimportant but merely  to hope that she is the forerunner of  a more complete analysis of the situation of all women in the USSR.  KATHARINE P.

V6H 2H4 (604) 7344777 28 Kinesis May 1986  by Melanie Conn  This month I've got three very different books for you, although they all  have humour, sex and drama and are  almost completely concerned with women!  I,  Vampire  by Jody Scott, Ace Science Fiction,  N.Y.  1984,  206 pages,   $2.75  Usually I don't read books about vampires but the cover of this one intrigued me. On one level the plot is  an old science fiction standby: two  alien cultures—one Good, the other  Evil—have infiltrated Earth; the Ry-  semians want to save the human race  from self-destruction and the Sajorians  want to exploit and enslave us. But the  two wonderfully outrageous heroines  lift the story into another dimension  as they wisecrack their way through  as wild an adventure as I've ever read.  Stirling O'Blivion is the vampire of  the title. Born in the thirteenth  century, she's bold, brassy and a  little bored with her job as the manager of a ballroom dance studio in  Chicago. Into her life comes a Rysemian  revolutionary, irresistably disguised  as Virginia Woolf. Falling madly in  love, the two team up to concoct a hilarious arid complicated plan to l  the human race.  I loved this book while I was reading  it! Scott has a breezy, witty style  and her pokes and jabs at contemporary  attitudes and behaviour are accurate  and entertaining. In scene after scene,  the tables are neatly turned on 'normal'  customs and beliefs—sex roles, fast  food, consumerism—and Stirling and  her lover (the misfits) glow with sanity. Still, undaunted as they are by  the modern world (including cops on  night duty and a menacing motorcycle  gang) even the invincible alien can't  prevent Stirling from being fired from  the dance studio when she's been seen  kissing a woman! No great moral messages here but it was fun to read a feminist adventure.  Always Coming Home  by Ursula LeGuin,  Harper and Row, N.Y.  1985,   524 pages,   $37.95  This is LeGuin's first new book in  several years" and-to say T^S^^agef" _  to get my hands on it is an understatement. She is a writer who breathes so  much life into her characters and concepts that her work has become a measure for the genre. As it turned out,  and to my surprise, this book wasn't  quite the "good read" I'd been anticipating; instead of gobbling it up in a  few days, I found myself dipping into  it over a period of several weeks.  Not at all a traditional novel, Always  Coming Home  is a kind of anthropological account of the Kesh. They are a  peaceful people who live in a valley  in Northern California, but in a  future when nuclear war has greatly  altered the terrain and shortened the  lifespan of the inhabitants. The  lengthy book includes maps, drawings,  charts, peotry, songs, plays, descriptions of customs and concepts as well  as the back of the book where an  alphabet, glossary and additional  information is presented. There's also  a narrative, in several sections, by  Stone Telling, a Valley woman who  lived for several years with the Condors in a distant community. The Condors are a territorial, hierarchical and  war-like people whose civilized  politics and practices are as familiar  to us as they are incomprehensible to  Stone Telling.  With the assistance of Pandora, the  anthropologist-author, the many  facets of Valley culture, gradually  emerge. For example, although all the  information on every subject ever  known to the human race is accessible  to any Valley citizen through The  Exchange, the computer plays a minor  role as "a useful and necessary link  to such necessary and undesirable  elements of existence as earthquakes,  fires, foreigners, and freight schedules."  The people of the Valley "lacked  drive i' that great urge to get done  which powers us...to go fast, get  through, be done, done with everything." They give lovely, long names  to their homes, like Rain Falling  Straight Down House and Here With  Its Back To The Vineyards House;  and "as their.names tended to spread  out and take time to say and write,  so the houses themselves tended to  take up room and elaborate themselves,  a porch added on here a wing there..."  The picture of this laid-back culture is elaborated slowly, with lots  of complexity and many surprises.  By the time I'd finished the last  installment of the narrative, I no  longer needed to turn to the back of  the book for clarification—a sign,  I realized, of the effective, and  ultimately enthralling nature of this  demanding book. Writing it was  clearly a labour of love for LeGuin  and invloved collaboration with several others, especially in the production of the cassette of songs  which accompanies the book. If the  price is too high for you (it was for  me), it's available at several libraries in Vancouver.  The Godmothers  by Sandi Rail,   The Women's Press,  London,  1982,  183 pages,   $10.50  "Apart from the buildings of the city,  all around, as far as you can see, is  flat, ruler flat until the land stretches out to a thin line which is faintly stained according to the season."  This is Regina, in the post-nuclear  future and the location of the Conmet  Building, the world-wide communications  centre, totally controlled by the  World Feminist Network.  The author of this book is a collective  member^of Broadsheet,   a New Zealand  feminist magazine. In The Godmothers  she  takes familiar feminist themes and exper  iences and plays out some logical and  amazing scenarios. The book shifts  back and forth between the present and  the future. (I found this a little confusing until the different characters  and locations became familiar.)  Time Stream Two is 100 years in the  future, a world where creativity and  technology are united for peaceful education and production. The action centres on the Conmet Building and the lives  of the women working there; ultimately,  there is a dramatic struggle for control  of the Building.  Time Stream One is the present and the  action occurs in Toronto where a branch  of the Feminist Network is deeply involved in gathering information about  multinationals and their government  conriections, for use in local community  organizing. The lives of the women in  the community are vividly detailed—at  potluck dinners and collective meetings,  on lazy mornings in a communal household  and in intimate moments with lovers.  As the plot thickens, danger to Network  members increases. The action moves from  one Time Stream to the other as the violence against women in the present is  mirrored in the future. The tragedies in  the book are mainly perpetuated by men,  although there are a few women who are  hurtful and one is a major villain. Still,  the heart of The Godmothers  is the loving  and powerful link forged between women  across the ages and beyond.  The 'Godmothers  is available at the Women's  Bookstore, 315 Cambie St., 684-0523 and at  Ariel Books, 2766 West 4th Ave., 733-3511.  Both stores have a selection of women's"  speculative fiction.

May 1986 Kinesis   29  by Connie Smith  Sisterfirel Various. Artists,  Roadwork,  Inc./Redwood Records  (1985)  There is something about live recordings  of women's festivals that make me very  sad. It's probably the fact that I wasn't  there. The Sisterfire Festival began in  • 1982 in Washington D.C. as an off-shoot  of Roadwork, Inc. Both organizations are  committed to "multi-racial, multi-ethnic  cross cultural diversity". The 1985  Sisterfire Festival recorded here certainly fulfills these goals.  This album includes Sweet Honey in the  Rock, Argentinian poet and former  political prisoner Alcia Partnoy, Holly  Near, D.C. street singer (since the  1940's) Flora Molton, Cris Williamson,  Mexican singer Amparo Ochoa, Ronnie  Gilbert, Jane Sapp, and a singing  family from South Carolina, the  Moving Star Hall Singers.  Sisterfire'.   is a wonderful album  beginning with the uplifting "This  Little Light of Mine" performed by  all the artists, followed by Jane  Sapp's gospel version of "Go Tell It  On- The Mountain". However I found it a  a bit jarring to go from Jane Sapp  into the traditional folk music of  Cathy Fink. But when the artists are  so diverse, there's probably not much  choice.  The album ends with a woman remarking  from the stage, "Sisterfire is a  symbol of our future; let's hold on  to it."  Scrapebook,  Meg Christian  Olivia REcords  (1986)  As a public figure, Meg Christian is  a controversy and a delight. As a  "v"rof the ground-breaking  L^M.Jf.Jf.^^.JfJf.Jf  Olivia Records, we followed with interest her journey from lead singer of  lesbian music to follower of Guruyami  Chidvilasanda. As an artist she hid  nothing from us and her music is  truly memorable.  Meg left Olivia Records last year to  travel with her guru. This year,  Olivia released a compilation of some  of Meg's best work.  Scrapebook  really is Meg Christian's  greatest hits: "Face the Music",  "Valentine Song", "Ode to a Gym Teacher", "Southern Home", "Sweet Darlin'  Woman", "The Road I Took". They're all  there. It's a perfect tribute to Meg's  years at Olivia and her contributions  to women's music.  Then Came the Children  Rosalie Sorrels with Bruce Carver,  Live  Aural Tradition Records  (1986)  Aural Tradition Records is the recording arm of the Vancouver Folk Music  Festival. And this particular record  was recorded at the Vancouver East  Cultural Centre on February 26, 1984.  Then Came the Children  is slow moving,  deliberate and quiet, with Ms. Sorrells  introducing most of the songs. Her  stage conversation is very personal—  stories about being a teenager in  . Boise, dating, girls necking with the  future farmers of America in the back  seats of cars, early marriages, backroom abortions, homes for unwed  mothers, and her own five children.  The high point for me was Rosalie's  own "Mother's Day SongV, a humourous and realistic look at all the  things she would accomplish now that  her children had grown. On the other  end-lof the scale is Malvina Reynolds  "Rosie Jane", a song I've never been  able to appreciate,. It could be interpreted as having a pro-abortion  theme, but if this is the case, the  victim is a stupid girl who keeps  getting pregnant, and the last time  iS   *st"ec,f Qrreis  .*mive -v^  ■**•**"  she wasn't sure who the father wag"w  because she was drunk. There must be  something wrong with my interpretive  functions.  Then Came the Children  is an extremely sensitive portrayal of one woman's  life. As I mentioned before, it is  slow moving. It's also a bit depressing.  Folksinger  Phranc  Rhino  (USA 1985)  Stiff UK 1986)  After listening to Phranc's debut several times, this is what I can tell  you about her: she wants to live with  Martina Navratilova, -nobody is going  to ".make her shave her legs, she wants  to be "strong, strong, like an Amazon".  and she's "always been one of the dudes,  with my flat .top fair and my combat  boots". She doesn't think all female  hairdressers are dumb and she wouldn't  be a gym teacher because she doesn't  want to "waste her life away on the  sidelines or in the bleachers", although  she admits to having a crush on her  gym teacher because "no one has muscles  like you do".  Phranc also likes to throw stones, first  at Thomas Noguchi, the former chief  coroner of the county of Los Angeles,  (to which I ask why bother), and at  Janet Cook, the first black woman to  win a Pulitzer Prize. Ms. Cook had her  prize taken away from her after it was  discovered that the story she had written  about a young junkie was actually a composite of several children she had met.  Phranc sings "liar, liar, pants on fire".  Again I say, aren't there bigger and  better targets?  On a more positive note, she doesn't  like female mudwrestling, people who  park in handicapped parking who aren't  handicapped, arid people who kill themselves .  ■So far, Phranc has had an interview and  a positive album review in England's  New Music Express, (they called her an  jf average Jewish American lesbian), and  her photograph is featured in the April  issue of Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine.  Phranc has a sweet voice, but considering the simpleness of her material, this  sudden popularity amazes me, especially  when there is a preponderance of extrem-  ly talented^ lesbian singer-songwriters  who are actually saying something.  Recently Phranc performed at the Comedy  Store in Los Angeles on a line-up that  featured only comics. One wonders who  the joke was on.

As a lesbian  who has just spent six weeks in a psychiatric unit, I'd like to add my opinions,  to the discussion.  My experience is different than many. I  was locked up because I went off some  medication—neuroleptics—that I had been  on for eight years, and I experienced a  psychotic break as a result. I had two  such breaks previously, and the second  time, in 1978, I was placed on maintenance medication. Because I thought that  perhaps I could do without the drug, I  went off and then tried to work through  the resulting illness at home. It didn't  work.  My friends supported me through several  weeks of deteriorating functioning and  increasing fantasy, fantasy I had no  control over. Finally I broke and ran to  a safe place (though I believed I was  running for a ridiculous reason) and the  friends who were with me got me to the  University of British Columbia psychiatric unit. I am now back on the same  medication at the same dose as before,  and back in the community.  I believe my illness is hereditary, and  - organic in nature. It is schizophrenia,  -which is the result of too much dopamine  'in my brain. This illness is controlled  •by medication but cannot currently be  cured. It is not responsive to therapy.  I am sick of hearing how diabetics need  their insulin and I need my drug, but  Jthe analogy is accurate. In other words,  I believe what the system has taught me  about myself, a belief based on my own  experiences.  More to the point, I would like to describe how the UBC psychiatric unit responded to the news that I was a lesbian.  jAfter my admission, my lover phoned the  ..ward I was on and identified herself as  my partner. The psychiatric nurse who  "Answered the phone responded by giving  A'her all the information she had about  my condition and status, and advising her  to phone the doctor responsible for more  information, which she did. The doctor  was also informative, taking time to talk  to her. Her statement that she was my  partner and by inference that I was a  lesbian was not questioned, though I do not  recall what I was saying or if I was asked.  It is distincly possible that I was asked.  At this point I was heavily drugged, in my  pyjamas, undergoing suicide prevention  (this involved only being permitted plastic  knives and forks, and requiring permission  to use the locked bathroom), being called  Jill instead of Elf, and fading in and out  of reality. This may. sound tough, but it  was certainly better than the deteriorating state I had been in at home. I was  relieved to be back on medication, though  at this point I had no faith I was returning to reality.  My lover, Sue, began her daily visits. At  first I was distant, but as I calmed down  I was very happy to see her. I was very  childlike and demonstrative, giving her lots  of hugs and cuddles. There was no question  that this was acceptable to the ward staff,  whether it occured in the day room or in  my own room. We were generally not disturbed  in my room though once a nurse asked us to  close the door.  The other patients were also mostly accepting of our relationship. One older woman  used to say, "Jill, here's Sue, now you'll  be fine", more as a general announcement  to the rest than anything. One young man  made a point of saying, "I'm not prejudiced against you!" I was put in a two-  person room-at one-point, and the other  roomie moved this out the next day because  she was uncomfortable with my lesbianism. .  I preferred.a room to myself anyway, and  the staff made the change with no comment.  Once it fell to me to choose the video  movie to show in the evening. I chose  "La Cage Aux Folles". A man from the  other ward wandered in late and was very  angry when he realized at the end it was  -a gay movie. He asked, "Who got this  movie?" and nobody answered, including  myself. This was the most negative experience I can recall, and it had a  positive side, in that no one focused his  anger on me.  When I was first there, the ward seemed  to be half men, half women. By the end  of my stay, there were three women and  about twenty men. They were varying  degrees of friendly or obnoxious, as  usual. One young man came in and immediately began talking about strippers,  to which I responded with a comment about  objectifying women and I wished he would  not, which made him cry. He went to see  some strippers as soon as he got a day  pass, so my opinion, unfortunately, ended  up making little difference to him,  I think there should be a woman-  only space in the hospital.  It is true that I was much less comfortable in the day room by the end of my  stay. I was also there a lot less—I  was involved in several activities and  I was permitted to leave the hospital  alone as long as I stayed on campus. I  spent some time at the Women's Centre  in SUB. Especially for women who do not .  know the UBC campus, I think there should  be a women-only space in the hospital.  I held daily conversations with both a  nurse and a psychiatrist during the  length of my stay. The main nurse had  previously been a friend, so we got  along quite well. The psychiatrist was  patronizing, but only in that he was  very sure the medication would stabilize  me, when I didn't believe it. I was  given an hour a day of one-on-one counselling between them. There was no indication on anyone's part that my sexuality had anything to do with my breakdown, or that it was anything other than  acceptable.  I had a great deal of support from outside the hospital as well. My lover,  friends, family, and therapists from outside came to see me. Sue was my daily  support, only missing two or three visiting days even in the snow. We began, and  are still involved in, relationship counselling through UBC.  Nym Hughes says at one point in Still  Sane,   "Any lesbian who makes contact with  psychiatric professionals—at any age,  in any way—is just plain lucky if she  isn't abused." I don't think I was just  lucky. I had a hell of a lot of support  both within and without the hospital, and  my feeling at the end of my stay there  is, that not all such places, not all such  people can be tarred with the homophobic  brush. There is such a condition as mentally ill. There are women who need drugs.  Our community needs to make room for our  differences.      lll|lI-y~-: ■      i^2v>if^~ May 1986 Kinesis   31  UETTERS  Africans against  genital mutilation  In Africa today women's voices are being  raised against genital mutilations' still  practiced on babies, little girls and  women. These voices belong to a few  women who are prepared to call it in  question when traditional practices endangered their lives, and health. The  total number of women affected is in any  case unknown, but without doubt involves  tens of millions of women.  Female genital mutiliation varies, and in  Africa, there has been a tendency to  group all kinds of mutilations under the  misleading term "female circumcision".  Circumcision as we know it is the cutting off taf the hood of the clitoris.  This is the mildest type and affects  only a small proportion of the millions  of women concerned. Besides this there  is 'excision', which is the cutting of  the clitoris and of all or part of the  labia minora.  The worst of these kinds of mutilations  is 'infibulation', which is the cutting  of the clitoris, labia minora and at  least the anterior or two thirds and  often the whole of the medical part of  the labia minora. These last two mutilations (excision and infibulation) are  the worst of all. These operations are  done with special knives, razor blades  or pieces of glass.  Most frequently the operations are prepared by an old woman of the village  known as 'Gedda' in Somalia or traditional  birth attendants know as 'Daya' in Egypt  and Sudan, and in some parts of Nigeria  and Mali by village barbers or women of  the blacksmith's caste with knowledge  of the occult.  More recently however, mutilations are  also being carried out in hospitals in  urban areas like Mali. Except in hospitals,  anaesthetics are never used. The age at  which the mutilations are carried out  varies from region to region. It varies  from a few days old by the Jewish Tal-  ashas in Ethiopia to about seven years  old in Egypt and many countries of  Central Africa, to adolescence among the  Ibo of Nigeria.  The little girl, entirely nude, is immo-.  bilized in a sitting position on a low  stool by at least three women. One of them  has her arms tightly around the little  girl's chest;, two others hold the child's  thighs apart by force, in order to open  the vulva wide. Men are rarely present at  operations. The child's arms are tied behind her back by two other women guests.  The operator cuts with her razor from top  to bottom of the small lip and then scrapes  the flesh from the inside of the large  lip. This nymphectomy and scraping aire  repeated on the other side of the vulva.  The little girl howls and writhes in pain,  although she is strongly held down. The  operator wipes.' the blood from the wound  and the mother, as well as the guests,  verify her work, sometimes by putting  their fingers in. The amount of scraping  of the large lips depends upon the technical ability of the operator. Herb mixtures, earth or ashes are rubbed on the  wound to stop bleeding. Exhausted, the  little girl is then dressed and put to  bed. The operation lasts from fifteen to  twenty minutes according to the ability  of .the old woman and the resistance put  up by the child.  Health risks and complications depend  upon the gravity of the mutilation,  hygienic conditions, the skill and  eyesight of the operator and the struggles  of the child. Whether immediate or long  term, the consequences are grave. Hemmor-  aging from the section of the internal  pudental artery may result in death.  Bad eyesight of the operator or resistance  of the child causes cuts in other organs  and may cause infection. Since the instu-  ments used have rarely been sterilized,  tetanus often results.      S'^SS  In all types of mutilations, a part of  a woman's body containing nerves of vital  importance to sexual enjoyment is amputated. There are psychological consequences as well: anxiety prior to the operation, terror at the moment of being  seized by the village matron, unbearable  pain, a sense of humiliation and betrayal  by parents, especially the mother. Long  term complications include infections of  the uterus. Sometimes a large foreign,  body forms in the interior of the vagina  as a result of the accumulation of mucous  secretions. The vagina may also be ruptured and painful menstruation is certain.  The forces which motivate a mother to  subject her daughters to such drastic  operations are different and bewildering.  The reasons given are often sexual, religious and sociological. Some African  societies believe that the operations may  diminish a woman's desire for sex and  thus erase prostitution. Some religions  including Christianity are of the opinion  that circumcision was one of the commands  delivered when the Lord made trial of  Abraham and that there was no clear indication in the case of female circumcision.  Muslim theologians also advocate mild  clitoridectomy. In some parts of Nigeria  it is a mark of honour and distinction  for both the girl and her family. In  Egypt, for instance, the uncircumcised  girl is called "nigsa" (unclean). Western  efforts, on the part of missionaries or  colonial masters to eliminate the practice  have simply served to confirm in peoples'  minds that colonial destruction of traditional customs weakens their societies  and exposes them to the ill effects of  western influence.  We, of the Christian Assembly of Nigeria,  Women's Centre, a Christian feminist  organization strongly condemn this outrageous act and have frequently been  appealing to many African Governments to  legislate against this dehumanizing tradition. Only one country has legislation  against female genital mutilation and  that is Sudan. But legislation  alone is not the only weapon, for it may  simply drive the operator underground and  have little effect in achieving any  measure of eradication. We are therefore  planning a massive campaign by radio,  television, film shows, a well-equipped  team of field workers, literatures, seminars, workshops and conferences against  these mutilations. Only a broad and sustained campaign of education will show  traditionalists the undesirable consequences of the practices which they are tempted  to follow. But what matters most here is  the fund for launching the campaign as we  have no fund. We therefore appeal to all  our womensfolk, women's network and organizations to donate to this worthy cause.  We need your support; the project needs  funding. With your support we shall win.

Protect tenants  from Expo 86  Kinesis:  We need your support and your physical  presence to show the residents of the  downtown eastside that not all British  Columbians are profit-motivated. Over  600 long term residents have been  evicted from their rooming houses and  hotels in Vancouver to make room for  Expo tourists.  Hotel owners have been given the green  light to capitalize on this mega-project  at the expense of their long term  clientelle. More than twenty hotels are  now preparing to evict the next batch  of residents.  Our provincial leaders state there is no  problem. "All is under control." The  Province advises theje is an Eviction  Registry for residents to check in with  and the City has hired an employee to  assist relocating anyone newly evicted.  That employee advises there are no rooms  left for women, for handicapped and after  the next 20 referrals there will be no  rooms left in this area.  The provincial leaders state some residents have been relocated to finer  lodgings and there is no crisis situation.  Some residents have found places on their  own only to be evicted again; others have  been relocated thorugh the Downtown East-  side Resident's Association and contracts  are being drawn up with new landlords  guaranteeing no fe-evictions of these  tenants. Some residents are simply refusing to move. Hotel contractors are bulldozing thier way through their rooms and  renovating around people:  •one 83 year old at the Marble Arch refuses to move. Why should she move after  so many years in her hornet  We cannot  force her to move but Expo guests with  $100 in their pockets per night will  motivate the hotel owner to move her  quickly;  •Four downtown residents have died;  •two have been hospitalized;  •one has been admitted to Riverview.  No one can prove eviction and re-location  are the causes but one has to admit they  are serious contributing factors.  The problem is not just affecting the  downtown community. They are the most ■  vulnerable and fragile group being affected. There is no more social housing  available. The Social Housing Inquiry  Commission is unable to handle any current  emergencies. Their report will be filed  with the other exhaustive Housing report  done in January, 1986. Our government's  reaction to a problem is to study it to  death. How can you help?  We urge you to help us in our demand for  legislation to freeze all evictions and  rent increases and roll back previous  evictions for those residents unable to  be re-located. Write your local MP and  tell him the truth about this issue.  Join us in our public protests April 22,  25 and May 2. Call DERA, 682-9031 for  details.

LETTERS  Writer regrets  occupation article  Kinesis: f%sf-^<  I am writing to correct mistakes I  made in submitting an article to the  local paper, Out of Line,  which they  entitled "A Feminist Looks at the  NDP". I also want to respond to Lisa  Price's criticisms of this in the  last issue of Kinesis.  I am regretful for submitting the  article, and particularly for referring to the transition house occupation in it. It was not a useful,  nor respectful, contribution to the  serious debate which this action,  and the women who participated, de- ■ •  I, and the women in my collective,  were among those who participated in  the fight to save VPH and supported  the occupation as a tactic in that  fight. I am sorry I did not consult  my own collective on whether to submit the article, although I implicated them by reference.  Lisa calls on me to debate differences on strategy up front, in the feminist press. I.agree the left press  is not the place to open up the debate. I should be speaking to those  I know share a unified opposition to  violence against women and are actively combatting it—even if we  disagree a lot on the strategy and  tactics of doing that.  I will contribue to the debate, taking into account who my gender and  olass allies are, and with more care  to principles of collectivity and  democracy in the process. I have also  written a letter to Out of Line  clarifying some of these points.  Sincerely,  Drena McCormack  Rape Relief  on funding  Kinesis:  I am responding to a letter in the  April '86 issue of Kinesis  written by  Lisa'Price. I am in agreement with  Drena McCormick's self-criticism  appearing in this issue.  The women of Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter are certainly among  those who "provided support to the  occupation and want to see the government take responsibility for paying  for services to women." At the same time,  we want women-operated, women-controlled  services and organizations. In the last  ten years in Vancouver, there hasn't  been a feminist, struggle against the  state in which Rape Relief women haven't  taken an active, and often leadership,  role. Our excitment and support for the  occupation of Vancouver Transition House  was in the spirit, of wanting to stop  those who "govern" over us from redefining '  the feminist-created word and work of  "transiton houses". Also to stop the  attacks on what feminists have built in  B.C. which this particular government  has conducted unceasingly for four years  or more.  We attended public meetings and rally,  signed letters and press releases and  sent weekly hot meals to the women in  the occupied shelter for these reasons.  We also did it because we knew it was  useful to women in need of that shelter  particularly during the summer months  when Rape Relief and Women's Shelter was  the only transition house operating in  Vancouver.  Lisa re-raises three specific points  •about Rape Relief and Women's Shelter's  political decisions about organizing a  feminist service. It is on these points  that I think we take a different view—  have a different practise from other  transition houses at least in the Lower  Mainland of B.C. These debates, particularly about unionizing feminist services and how to fund-raise are international debates within the women's  liberation movement not just in Vancouver. We support the plurality of experimentation that characterizes the  movement and we have made our own  choices for our own work thus far.  All of us are unpaid workers at the  house and centre—volunteer labour.  No paycheque but no requirement to keep  logs on the women and kids who use the  house. No blackmail to report to social  worker supervisors on the "parenting  skills" of a new mother. No extra power  over the women and the kids living in  the house. No pay cheque but we are  still able to offer 24 hour staffing of  house and crisis line. Although we have  a history of supporting union struggles  for the rights of workers, and women  workers in particular, we choose not to  unionize ourselves as workers. We don't  have an employer to defend ourselves  against. Although we don't have the  wage and other fringe benefits that  unionized workers have fought for, we  do have a jlarge degree of control over  the work we do and the decisions that  affect our working lives. Democratic  decision-making is easier because of  our numbers and collective structure.  We do apply for a small amount of municipal government money and raise the  remainder of the money necessary ourselves. This takes about the same  amount of time and energy as it took  when we were applying for, maintaining  and accounting for provincial funds.  We are not among the shelters in the  lower mainland who receive a per diem  rate (an amount of money per woman per  day) from the province.  Many shelters choose to take the per  diem deal rather than close their  doors. The per diem arrangement gives  the province a great deal of power in  several areas inside the shelter—the  length of a woman's stay and the amount  of cash in her hands are two such areas.  When a woman arrives at a shelter that  receives a per diem rate, MHR considers that her rent, food and utility  cost have already been covered. They  will provide her with a "comfort  allowance" of between five and one  hundred dollars per month depending  on the size of her family. She must  buy everything else she needs for  the month including clothing, transportation, baby food and diapers.  When a woman arrives at our shelter  without a per diem deal, MHR will  issue a full welfare cheque in her  own name with which she pays for  rent and food just as she would in  her own rented place. But, unlike  in her own place, the rent, food and  utilities for a woman with two kids  could amount here to just over $500  and her welfare cheque to $770. Here'  she actually has more cash in her  own control—not much, but more—  than were she to get even the maximum,  comfort allowance from MHR. So,  while the per diem arrangement actually  costs MHR more, the money goes more  to the grocer, the utility corporation  and mortgage companies and less to  the women in need. Women who are  ineligible for welfare are welcome  at our shelter and are able to be  accommodated because of our other  fund-raising .activities.  The money we raise to keep our operation afloat, just like other nonprofit societies, comes from a variety  of sources and ways. Lisa calls this  practise "double taxation". This  term may also be applied to the activities of other feminist organizations  all over the continent, government  funded or not. Both income tax and  sales tax are compulsory, at least  for poor and middle income people,  and donating to Rape Relief and  Women's Shelter and other feminist  organizations is not compulsory and  also can be tax deductible. We ask  some unions to donate money and some  progressives to pledge monthly cash  on the basis of their politic and  willingness to support women's  struggles.  We ask corporations to donate on  the basis of their responsibility  to the people of the city where they  make their profits. We ask individual men who say they are supportive  to the women's liberation movement  to make a financial donation to our  project or any other women's  organization. Individuals donate to  us on the basis of their concern for  women who are victims of male violence.  Once the money is donated, the women  in this organization decide its expenditure. At the same time, we loudly  object to government tax expenditures  being re-directed from services to .  corporations such as North East Coal  without consultations of those being  taxed.  We are a non-profit society with a  board, an annual general meeting,  financial statements registered in  Victoria and a tax number. We are  also an anti-rape centre, and emergency shelter for women and their  children—both a feminist service  and an organizing centre. We are  . vulnerable to funding cutbacks, as  Lisa points out, as are other feminist  organizations. The provincially owned  and operated Vancouver .Transition  House was also vulnerable not only in  1984. It is within all of our very  recent experience in B.C. that even a  government owned and operated transition house is not a guarantee of funding security. There simply doesn't seem  to be a guarantee these days.  The debates in the women's liberation  movement about strategies and tactics  for ending violence against women which  began in Vancouver in the late sixties  are still important to have among us.  I hope these clarifications and contributions will continue to move this  debate forward.  Bonnie Agnew, for Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter Collective May 1986. Kinesis   33  LETTERS  Letters about India tour article  Received April 6th  Kinesis:  We note with distress that an enclosure we meant to make with our mail  out protesting the "Status of Women  in India and Nepal" tour organized by  Fran Hosken of WIN News  was never included in our hurry. Therefore, we  request that this preface, which should  have been included with the article  by Madhu Kishwar and Ruth Vanita that  Kinesis  reprinted in the Feb. 1986  issue, be published. Our apologies for  the confusion our error must have generated. The preface reads as follows:  This year,   like past years,  a status of  women tour is being organized to visit  India. This year it is titled "Status  of Women: India and Nepal: Focus on  'Health'and Economic Projects." It is  escorted by Fran Hosken,  editor of  Women's International Network News and  takes place from March 3-22,   1986.  What  follows below is an edited version of an  article originally published in  Indian j  Express, March 4,   1984 by Madhu Kishwar  and Ruth Vanita, who are both editors  of Manushi, a feminist magazine on  women and society published in New  Delhi.  Their article was a response  to an earlier' tour (in 1984) but  many of its critical comments are   -  relevant to this current one as well.  Sincerely,  Lesbians of Colour  of Toronto  Received April 12  Kinesis:  We request that you send us a copy of  the Feb.'86 article you printed so we  can discuss it with our lawyers.  We request that you print a front page  retraction in the next issue and that  you write a letter of apology to us  and publish it alongside. We shall then  decide—based on your statement—if  we shall sue. We shall also bring this  matter to the attention of other parties of Canada—including the national  Status of Women Committee with whom  we have been in contact for years.  In fact we have sent you (free) WIN  News  since 1976 when I was in Vancouver and was invited by your organization to speak at one of your meetings  at the HABITAT Conference of the  United Nations. Since then I have  been sending you free copies of WIN  News.  I am of course stopping this  at once and shall remove your label/  exchange. We shall publish your  letter of apology in the next issue  of Win News.  Unless your actions are satisfactory—  which we shall let our lawyers decide,  we shall have to sue for damages,  defamation of character and deliberate  misinformation of your readers with  slanderous accusations that you knew  were untrue from the start (as the  dates were all wrong) hence your intent was to damage us regardless of  the true facrs.  Sincerely,  Fran P. Hosken  WIN News  P.S. We shall also discuss with our  lawyers if criminal action should be  taken, based on. your reply.  Re: Status of Women Tour to India and  Nepal, March 3-22, 1986.  In December 1985, we mailed you a > L^jm  letter and article concerning a tour  to India and Nepal. We wish to clarify  details in both, which have since  caused confusion, and raised issues  of misrepresentation.  In our letter, we mistakenly implied,  due to an editorial error, that the  article written by Madhu Kishwar and  Ruth Vanita, was critiquing the  "Status of Women Tour to India and  Nepal, March 3-22, 1986, escorted by  Fran Hosken."  In clarification, Kishwar's and Vanita's  article was written in response to an  earlier "Status of Women Tour to India  and Nepal, Feb. 24-March 16, 1984".  We have no information to confirm that  Fran Hosken had anything to do with  that 1984 tour, as we have previously  implied. She did, however, lead the 1986  tour to India and Nepal.  In our December 1985 mailout, we intended to critique' Hosken's'leading of the  1986 tour, and also Odyssey Tour's organizing of the 1984 and 1986 tour, because of it's cultural voyeuristic content.  Based on the details in the brochure  advertising the "Status of Women Tour to  India and Nepal, March 3-22, 1986", we  felt and continue to feel that Kishwar's  and Vanita*s 1984 article raised criticisms which remain applicable to the 1986  tour.  We have written to Kishwar and Vanita,  clarifying why we used their article  to address the 1986 tour.  Lesbians of Colour,  Toronto  Housing from page 5  If a woman cannot handle hotels, smith-  wrights or "boyfriends" she can find  housing, temporarily, at emergency  shelters. Operated by private social  service agencies, often with religious  affiliations, the shelters are clearly  not a solution to anyone's housing problems.  The real long term solution, government  subsidies, public or co-op housing, is  in short supply.  Subsidized housing units with self-contained private bathrooms and cooking  facilities are in such demand that long  waiting lists are taken for granted.  The first United Church's Jennie Pent-  land Place has twice as many applicants as units. DERA's co-ops have  3 applicants for every unit available. Recent criticism of subsidized  social housing, lead by the provincial government, has raised fears  that social housing funding will be  the next target of the Socred  government.  ■I just heard about one place behind   ■  the bar here and I went to see about  it and he said  'we gotta waiting  list so long here you could wait  months and months. ' I know one  place. It's beautiful. But they go  real quick...if there's a vacancy. ,  Downtown eastside woman...

Since the Provincial government cut off all  our funding in 1983, we have relied on short term federal grants and  donations from supporters to keep us going. Now, as federal grants  get scarcer, we need your help more than ever.  The Health Collective was founded on the principle of self help and  thus promotes women's active participation in, and control of, our  health care. Our resources give women both an understanding of the  ways in whicfi the conditions of our lives create ill health, and  comprehensive information on prevention and treatment options.  With this information, we are better able to make informed decisions  about our health care.  YOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS:  ■ Health information for women: our information centre gives  women access to clear understandable information on hundreds  of health-related topics.  ■ Counselling: we provide informational, supportive and referral  counselling.  ■ Public speaking and workshops: we are frequently asked by  community groups to give talks and workshops on a wide number  of health topics such as birth control, PMS, menopause, patients'  rights.  ■ Access: information is available to women across Canada through  our mail order service; many of our publications (e.g. A Feminist  Approach to Pap Tests, AIternatiy^pproaches to Health &  Healing, and Breast Health) were researched ariawritten by the  Health Collective.  ■ Political action: the Health Collective organizes and supports  actions aroundspecific issues such as abortion, D.E.S., Depo  Provera, the Dalkon Shield and the Copper 7 IUD.  ■ A women-controlled organization: over the years, women have built  the Health Collective into an organization with a national  reputation for consistent and excellent work.  Your donation will help keep this essential service going.  All donations are tax-deductible.  $&  VANCOUVER WOMEN'S HEALTH COLLECTIVE  Ml 888 BURRARD STREET  Vancouver, B.C. V6Z 1X9 682-1633  ft
