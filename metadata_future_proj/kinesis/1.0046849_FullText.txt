Telephone: (604) 255-5499  Counting Our Victories As Kinesis goes to press, voters in BC  have just returned from the polls...re-elect-  ing the New Democratic Party by a slim  majority. This month, Kinesis could only  hold off going to press long enough to bring  our readers a short story on the election  outcome. But we do have in this issue, an  article on the successful organizing work  by women during the campaign to ensure  women's equality issues and women's voting power were taken very seriously by all  political parties and the media {see stories  opposite page.]  Weil have more on the BC election in  our July /August issue after women in the  province have had some time to reflect on  what it all means and what we need to do  next to ensure that women cannot be taken  for granted by any of the political parties.  On the subject of lesbian and gay  rights...when \as\Kinesis went to press, we  reported that the House of Commons was  getting set to vote on the amendment to the  Canadian Human Rights Act. In the end,  the passing of the legislation was somewhat  anti-climatic, given that it came after a huge  uproar by members of the Reform party  and the lengthy debate about giving Liberal caucus members a free vote [see page  14 for an analysis of the legislation.]  Reformers Bob Ringma and David  Chatters did Prime Minister Jean Chretien  a big favour by ensuring that the label of  "homophobic" remained permanently  stamped on the Reform Party, and not on  any of the anti-lesbian and gay Liberal caucus members.  Chretien caved in and let his caucus  vote as they choose, lest he have to toss  another member of his party out for voting  against him anyway (a few weeks earlier,  Chretien kicked long-time Liberal John  Nunziata out of his caucus for voting  against the government's budget.) The free  vote opened the doors for 23 Liberals to  vote against the legislation, including  Roseanne Skoke and Tom Wappel, who  have been very public about their opinions  on "homosexuality and the homosexual  lifestyle."  Back in the Reform camp, eventually,  Reform leader Preston Manning had to step  in and remove Ringma and Chatters from  his caucus—at least temporarily. But one  Reformer who didn't get tossed out of his  party's caucus for blatant homophobic  comments was Grant Hill, or should we say,  Dr. Grant Hill. Dr. Hill decided to use his  medical credentials and diagnose lesbians  and gay men as being "spreaders of disease." He even came up with something  called "gay bowel disease," which lesbians  and gay men apparently are prone to getting. (We actually would have thought having "happy bowels" was a good thing.)  The Canadian Medical Association is  currently looking into Hill's public statements. Perhaps Hill should re-focus his  medical practice on looking into the high  incidence of foot-in-mouth disease among  Reform party members.  More on the subject of disaffected Reformers. Poor, poor Jan Brown.

Preston Manning didn't appreciate Brown's comments  about intolerance and extremism in the  Reform Party.  After she was dumped from caucus  (along with Ringma and Chatters), Brown  quit the Reform Party. She says she left Reform because of its refusal to acknowledge  women's issues as a legitimate political  concept.  But lest we thought, even momentarily, that Brown had come over toour side...a  few weeks later she was back to her old  right-wing self when she was asked (why  wasshe asked) to comment on the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women  (NAC). Brown responded that she thought  NAC had "become a very special interest  lobby with a much narrower focus..." and  that "NAC had outgrown its relevance as  women have made gains in society." Guess  Brown has "reformed."  Here's something that seems to have  passed us by at Kinesis. Last February, as  one of his last gasps as Immigration Minister, Sergio Marchi agreed to back down on  his proposal to bring in a $10,000 bond for  Canadians wanting to sponsor family  members for immigration. However,  Marchi refused to take it a step further and  rescind the $975 Head Tax [landing fee.]  As well, the feds got sneaky and increased the level of income necessary to be  eligible to sponsor another family member,  still making it difficult for many people to  sponsor family members to Canada.  Rescinding the head tax is just one of  the demands of the National Women's  March Against Poverty, which will soon be  descending on Ottawa.  The culmination of the march coincides with NAC's AGM and its annual  lobby of federal political parties. Definitely  high on the agenda when the NAC lobby  meets the Liberal government will be  what's going to be discussed at the first  ministers meeting June 21-22 in Ottawa.  The fate of such things as social programs,  national standards and public pensions  continue to be the critical issues women are  taking to the feds.  The Liberals showed their slash and  burn stripes again recently, when they  pulled the funding plug for another set of  critical social services—support programs  for people with disabilities.  Kinesis will keep you posted on the  success of women's mobilizing and lobbying in this country.  Until next time, take care.  The clouds are hanging low overhead  as we are coming to the end of another Kinesis production and to the end of a provincial election campaign in BC.  We held off going to press one day—  to the day after the election—so we could  give our readers a short reaction piece on  the outcome. Weil have a longer analysis  article next issue.  As you may have noticed this issue  Kinesis is a few pages shorter than it usually is—four pages shorter. Life is still hectic here at Kinesis and Vancouver Status of  Women and this has added to the work and  stress of getting Kinesis to press on time and  in good shape. We've also been busy, busy,  busy organizing with women and women's  groups in the Lower Mainland around the  provincial election.  But we'll be back on track soon, we  promise,...and in our next issue—our July/  August summer issue—we'll be bringing  you 28 pages of news about women that's  not in the dailies. So stay tuned.  As well as organizing around the BC  election, women at Kinesis were taking to  the road with the National Women's March  Against Poverty. Fatima Jaffer and her crew,  car and colourful banners joined the caravan as it sped off out of Vancouver and  toured across the province and into Alberta  (not too far in, though—just to Calgary).  For a glimpse of the cross-province trekking excitement, check out Fatima's photo  essay starting on page 12.  Speaking of trips away, Agnes Huang  will be off in Ottawa in June for a violence  against women consultation and NAC's  annual general meeting. She'll be reporting back on the consultation, NAC's AGM  and its annual lobby of federal political  parties, as well as bringing back lots of stories and photos from women at Tent City—  where the National Women's March will  wind up. Agnes will be gone for over a  week so Kinesis could use some extra help  getting those story ideas together, writing  articles, finding out what's going on in the  women's movement across Canada,  putting the paper together...all kinds of  things. So if you're interested and able to  help out, please give us call at 255-5499.  We're off in July—for a much needed  rest—but August will be rolling in soon,  and it will be another busy month here at  Kinesis. As well as preparing for our September issue, we will be holding our annual Kinesis Benefit and Raffle in late August. The exact date—and all the fun raffle  prizes you could win—will be announced  soon.  We're still looking for volunteers to  help out in organizing the Benefit, so if  you're interested in working with some  groovy women, call us: 255-5499.  A few changes in Kinesis' appearance  we would like to bring to your attention:  First, we've gone back to using PMTs on  our cover rather a scanned image. We're  still working out the complexities of scanning and our computers. Also, as someone  pointed out to us...Kinesis hasn't yet  switched the type of newsprint we use...as  we had announced we would two issues  ago. We expect it will be happening soon,  but we thought we'd let you know, in case  you were wondering.  Thanks to everyone who helped make  this issue make it to the presses...and also  big welcome to new Kinesis writers: J.C.  Starr and Joyce Jones; and to our new production volunteers: Leanne Keltie, Paula  Wellings, J.C Starr, Michelle Sylliboy and  Karen Joseph. It's always great (and much  more fun) to have such wonderful volunteers around!/ nd abig thanks also to Paula  for showing "K-values" in Photoshop  to us, which helped us make the quality of  our scanning of photos better.  If you are interested in helping to create Kinesis, come by during our next production, June 19-26, or drop by to one of  our next story meetings Mon, June 3 and  Tues, Aug 6 at 7pm.  Well until July, bye for now, happy  reading!  JUNE 1996  J, News  BC election 1996:  NDP wins tight race  Women in British Columbia heaved a  few sighs of relief as the New Democratic  Party was re-elected as the provincial government, defeating Gordon Campbell and  the Liberal Party.  But it was close, way too close for  women's comfort. Throughout election  night, the tallies seesawed back and forth  between the NDP and the Liberals. It took  three hours for the ballots to be counted and  when it was finally over, the NDP had triumphed with 39 seats to the Liberals 33.  The Reform Party trailed with two seats  and Gordon Wilson won the only seat for  his Progressive Democratic Alliance Party.  Among the prominent NDP women  who held onto their seats were Penny  Priddy, the former minister of women's  equality, and Sue Hammell, who took over  the ministry from Priddy.  Joan Smallwood, who is popular with  women because of her progressive stances  especially around issues of women's  poverty, was also re-elected.  Joy MacPhail, who replaced  Smallwood as the social services minister and brought in the NDP's regressive BC Benefits social assistance program, will also return to the legislature.  Perhaps one of the highlights of  election night for women, and especially women of colour, was the landslide victory by Jenny Kwan, the first  Chinese Canadian woman ever  elected to a (provincial or federal) legislature in Canada.  Kwan [see photo] is a long-time  community activist in Vancouver who  will now have to step down as the  lone member of COPE (the Coalition  of Progressive Electors) in Vancouver's city  council.  There was some bad news for women  as long-time feminist Margaret Birrell was  Jenny Kwan, at right, with her mother and  Raminder Dosanjh.

Birrell has been extremely  supportive of feminist organizations in BC  and is a founding member of the Vancou  ver Status of Women, among other organizations.  Another prominent NDP woman candidate who lost to a Liberal was the NDP's  finance minister Elizabeth Cull.  By the end of the night, one thing was  clear: BC had re-elected a government with  the least regressive policies, and one that  women believe is more open to challenge  by women and other socially progressive  groups.  As Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter's Lee Lakeman says, women  across the province have to stay vigilant in  reminding politicians, whatever their  stripe, that women's equality issues cannot  be ignored.  "We as a women's movement have to  keep up our mobilizing in order to be a  force for progressive change. We need to  inform the NDP and the elected MLAs just  how intense the solidarity within the women's movement is," she says.  Women's Election Agenda coalition:  Putting women in the picture  by Andrea Imada  Less than one week into the provincial  election campaign in British Columbia, it had  become clear that politicians of all parties and  stripes were treating women's issues as expendable.  No mention had been made of women,  nor of the impact on women of the economic  and social policy promises flying fast and furious from politicians' tongues.  Talk of "downsizing" the government to  a smaller number of ministries also didn't  address the demise of the Ministry of Women's Equality nor how that would affect programs and services provided by and for  women.  That's when women in the Lower Mainland mobilized for action. The Vancouver Status of Women (VSW) got the ball rolling, contacting over 50 women activists and groups  in the Lower Mainland with a view to discussing an election strategy.  "It became clear the parties were going  to ignore women's equality issues," said  VSW's Audrey Johnson. "Women were being  marginalized and we felt it was absolutely  critical to get organized. The situation wasn't  going to change unless we pushed the  agenda."  Soon women were gathered at VSW's  offices for a meeting. Within a couple of hours,  making phone calls, writing press releases,  The Women's Election Agenda questionnaire quizzed the party leaders on 26 issues and  policies which have significantly impacts for  women in BC. As a result, women have a powerful lobbying tool in their hands-election promises to which we can hold the government accountable and information on areas where we  need to put pressure on them.  Now that the NDP have been re-elected, we  print below a small sample of the NDP's responses. Both questions and answers are very  much shorter versions of the original (some NDP  answers span several pages). A full copy of  desktopping and other jobs were being  divvied up. The Women's Election Agenda  was on a roll.  The centrepiece of the campaign was an  extensive questionnaire on 26 different issues,  compiled with the input from numerous  women in the Lower Mainland area of BC.  The document raised questions specific  to provincial policies and jurisdiction and  covered a range of issues, including job creation, free-standing abortion clinics, Aboriginal women and the treaty process, lesbian  rights, health care, pensions, women-controlled rape crisis centres, HIV-positive women,  economic policies, welfare and workfare, and  childcare.  The Coalition earmarked the continued  existence of the Ministry of Women's Equality as the litmus test of the parties' commitment to addressing women's concerns. The  Ministry, established by the NDP government  in 1991, is the only source of dedicated funding to women's organizations which provide  advocacy and services for and by women.  The questionnaire was sent to the five  major party leaders (NDP, Liberals, Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA, party of the  ex-Liberal leader Gordon Wilson), Reform,  and the Green Party) with a one-week deadline to reply. It was also faxed out to media  outlets, women activists, and women's centres in B.C.  As well, it was widely distributed to the  hundreds of women who attended the kick-  off rally for the National Women's March  Against Poverty in Vancouver, and to women  who attended rallies for the marchers in about  ten BC communities.  The media started taking some notice.  Women issues were on the news and on  the agenda at the much-hyped televised leadership debate. The NDP spent money on political advertising that focused on women.  Women called into talk-radio shows and  asked questions at all-candidates meetings.  The Coalition received calls and feedback  from women in other parts of the province  about activities in their communities.  The goal of the Women's Election Agenda  was being realized: Women's equality had  catapulted onto the election platform—and  the focus of news reports, radio programs and  the leaders' debates clearly showed the questionnaire were instrumental in shaping the  debate on women's issues.  By the week's end, the NDP, Liberals,  PDA and the Green Party had responded to  the questionnaire in varying degrees of detail. It was somehow not surprising that the  right wing Social Credit and Reform Parties  did not respond at all.  From the Women's Questionnaire:  ing a self-addressed, stamped, 9"x 12'envelope  to Women's Election Agenda, c/o VSW, Suite301-  1720 Grant Street, Vancouver, BC, V5L2Y6.  Question 1: If your party is elected, will you commit to maintaining a stand-alone Ministry of Women's Equality at the same or greater level of funding?  Answer Yes. Our New Democrat government created Canada's first free-standing ministry dedicated  to women...We are committed to ensuring that the  Ministry's budget is not cut despite increasing fiscal pressures caused by federal offloading.  Question 15: Due to changes in the recent income  assistance regulations, people coming to BC have  been disqualified from receiving income assistance  for the first three months after their arrival. This  has had a particularly devastating effect on refugees and women coming to BC to leave abusive  male ex-partners in other provinces. Will you party,  if elected, reinstitute immediate income assistance,  removing the three-month residency requirement?  Answer In the face of continued federal offloading,  there are no plans to alter the residency requirement at this time.  The NDP response was the most elaborate, with 15 written pages chronicling their  last five years in power, along with a commitment to maintaining a women's equality  ministry.  The Green Party was comprehensive in  promising progressive changes to many existing policies and programs, including up-  ping the funding of the Ministry of Women's  Equality, rescinding BC Benefits social assistance legislation and the 3-month residency  requirement, and restoring funding to legal  aid.  The Liberal and PDA responses were  models of brevity. In many cases, they answered simply "yes" with no elaboration or  details. In other cases, they offered vague  statements without concrete commitment to  action. Both said they had no intention of continuing to support a stand-alone Ministry of  Women's Equality.  But the Women's Election Agenda had  done its work and let the politicians know  women were watching, listening, questioning, and voting...and would continue to do  so even after the winner has been declared.  Please see box for more details on the Women's Election Agenda questionnaire.  Andrea Imada was a member of the BC Women's Election Agenda.  Question 16: Under the new BC Benefits program,  with the elimination of the $200 earnings exemption, single mothers on income assistance who  work part-time can only keep 25 percent of what  they earn, and the program only lasts for one  year...Will your government, if elected, rescind  this provision of BC Benefits so single mothers  can benefit from part-time work?  Answer The 25 percent earning exemption-  which people on Income Assistance may continue to claim for a maximum of 12 months in  any 36-month period-encourages people to  move toward full employment. The more they  earn, the more they are allowed to keep. News  British Columbia's Ac/option Act:  Recognizing our families  by J.C. Starr  A recent change to British Columbia's  Adoption Act was hailed as a major victory by lesbian and gay rights activists.  In mid-April, the BC provincial government introduced a triad of changes to  the Adoption Act. One of those amendments makes it possible for lesbian and gay  couples to legally adopt children, making  BC the first jurisdiction in the world to recognize lesbian and gay partnerships in legislation.  The new adoption legislation means  that a common law couple— straight, lesbian or gay—can adopt children. Previously, the Adoption Act only permitted single adults and married couples to adopt.  Lesbians and gay men could only adopt  children as individuals but not as a same-  sex couple. The new amendment removes  that restriction.  The significance for lesbian and gay  couples is that the new Act will allow them  to adopt non-biological children and biological children. This means the partner of  the biological parent will be legally recognized as a parent. Under the old law, if a  biological lesbian mother allowed lesbian  Graphic by J.C. Starr.  partner to adopt her child, she would herself lose parental rights.  Now, the biological mother can assign  legal custody of the children to her partner if anything tragic should occur. On a  day-to-day basis, the amendment means  the non-biological parent is legally in a position to speak to medical and educational  authorities and to make decisions concerning the situation and welfare of the children.  "This is nothing short of a revolution  for lesbian and gay rights," says lawyer  barbara findlay. She adds that she already  has two dozen lesbian co-parents as clients  who are ready to adopt their partners' biological children.

It's  also in the best interest of our children that  we are able to make decisions about their  daycare, schooling and health care without facing discrimination," says Tamara,  who is about to become a mother when her  partner Miekel gives birth in August.  Tamara and Miekel have already prepared co-habitation and custody agreements for their first child, who won't have  to wait long before she has two legal mothers to watch over her—the new Adoption  Act will become law on November 4,1996.  Last fall, when the amendments to the  Adoption Act were debated in the legislature, voices of opposition rang in the legislature and the public because of the section dealing with adoption by lesbian and  gay couples. The new new legislation was  enacted but not proclaimed.  On April 18, the new Adoption Act  was quietly proclaimed in by the New  Democratic government through an Order-  in -Council meaning there was not debate  in the legislature on the issue.  The amendment to allow lesbian and  gay couples to adopt children was fought  for alongside with other amendments that  affect the placement of Aboriginal children  and disclosure of information concerning  biological parents and adopted children.  The amendments came about through  the organizing and lobbying work of a  group of adoptees, adoptive and biologi  cal parents, lesbian and gay couples, and  their advocates who formed committees to  discuss various proposed changes to the  Adoption Act that would work for them.  barbara findlay says the provision affecting lesbian and gay couples was supported by all the members of the committees reviewing the Adoption Act. "Even  though some of the people on the committees are quite right-wing, they have all  agreed that they will support everybody's  rights," says findlay.  The changes affecting Aboriginal children mean that priority will be given to  placing children with applicants of Aboriginal ancestry.  In the 1960s, a large number of Aboriginal children were taken from their reservations and placed in non-Native families throughout Canada and the United  States. With the new amendment, Aboriginal children will be kept closer to home in  the lives of adoptive Aboriginal parents.  The third change to theAdoptionAct  gives adopted children and biological parents the right to access information on each  other, but only if both parties want that information made available. Either party  would still have the right to seal their  records if they did not want information  about them to be released.  /.C. Starr is an artist and a first time writer  with Kinesis.  Gay & Lesbian Centre,  1170 Bute St.  327-4437 News  Custody and access:  Mothers' mobility  rights curtailed  by Lissa Geller  Feminist organizations, including the  Women's Legal Education and Action Fund  (LEAF), are reacting with concern to a recent decision by the Supreme Court of  Canada (SCC) which will have a substantial impact on the rights of custodial par-  ents-77 percent of whom are women.  The case being dealt with by the SCC  centered around a custodial parent, Janet  Gordon, who moved to Australia with her  seven-year-old daughter. A family court  judge had granted her custody of her  daughter. The child's father, Robin Goertz,  appealed the lower court ruling and argued  that Gordon should not be allowed to move  since it would limit his access to his daughter. He demanded either he obtain full custody or that his ex-wife and child be forced  to return to Canada.  LEAF says it intervened in the case to  argue that what was really at stake was the  extent to which mothers are permitted to  make decisions relating to their children  after a relationship breaks down. LEAF argued that what is in the best interests of the  child is "inextricably linked to what is in  the best interests of the custodial mother,"  who is the most competent to decide what  is in the child's best interest.  In its decision, the Supreme Court of  Canada unanimously rejected Goertz' appeal and held that Gordon could keep her  daughter in Australia. However, the court  then went a step further and outlined the  principles which should guide lower courts  when making decisions of this kind.  In the majority decision, on these principles, the court was split 6-3, written by  Madam Justice Beverly McLachlin, the  court ruled that in many cases, a move by  the custodial parent of a minor child  amounts to "a material change in circumstance" and requires the re-examination of  custody by the courts. In re-examining the  custody agreement, the courts should only  consider the best interests of the child and  no other considerations should be apparent.  barbara findlay  B.A. M.A. LIB.  is delighted to announce  that she is now practicing law  with the law firm of  Smith and Hughes  321-1525 Robson Street  Vancouver  Tel: (604) 683-4176  Smith and Hughes offer a full range of legal  services to the lesbian, gay and bisexual  communities of Vancouver.

McLachlin wrote that, "All too often,  such applications [for custody] have descended into inquiries into the custodial  parent's reasons or motive for moving. Parental conduct-however meritorious or  however reprehensible-does not enter into  the analysis unless it relates to the ability  of the parent to meet the needs of the child."  She further added that "Every child is entitled to the judge's decision on what is in  their best interests."  As well, the majority of the court found  there was no onus on the non-custodial  parent to prove the undesirability of the  move but, rather, that both parents bear  equal responsibility to show the impact on  the children of a move.  "LEAF is concerned that this decision  will impact negatively on women's ability  to make choices once they have been  awarded custody," says Jennifer Scott,  LEAF'S Director of Litigation.  LEAF'S Carole Curtis also expressed  concern that "the risk of losing custody will  effectively deter women from even raising  the issue of moving," making it difficult for  women to make informed choices about  their future and the futures of their children.  She adds that the judgment will make it  more attractive for a man to take his former  wife to court if she decides to relocate with  their child.  In its majority decision, the SCC also  explicitly registered its approval for settling  custodial issues through litigation. This  emphasis on court-centred decision-making has also raised concerns for women.  "This decision speaks loudly that the  court, not the custodial parent, should be  making the decisions," says Curtis. "That  is not the direction in which family law has  been going for the past twenty years."  As well, the emphasis on court litigation severely disadvantages women since  they are often not financially able to bear  the expense of lengthy court cases. "It ignores the reality that most people, and certainly most women, cannot afford the expense of continuing court cases," says  Curtis.  Jennifer Scott says while LEAF is disappointed with the majority decision, LEAF  is pleased that many of its arguments did  receive explicit approval by three Supreme  Court j udges. A concurring judgment, written by Madame Justice Claire L'Heureux-  Dube and for the most part supported by  two other justices, appears to substantially  agree with LEAF'S position, says Scott.  L'Heureux-Dube emphasized that deciding where to live is an integral part of  the custodial mother's overall responsibilities.  Scott says LEAF hopes lower court  judges will seriously consider the concurring opinion "since in our view it more accurately reflects the realities involved in the  issue of relocation."

New Mural at Everywomen's Health Centre  On May 23, women gathered in front of the Everywoman's Health  Centre, the oldest free-standing abortion clinic in Vancouver, for a ribbon  cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of the hollyhock mural on an  outside wall of the Centre's building.  The mural was sponsored by MayWorks Festival of Working People  and the Arts and designed by Vancouver artist Cheryl Hamilton [pictured  above in front of the mural.]  Jackie Foley, a nurse, says the building used to be all white and uninteresting; now it's colourful, distinctive and different from neighbouring  buildings. "It's a warmer place for clients and workers to come to, and the  many coloured flowers on the mural reflect the multicultural diversity of the  neighbourhood and the clients of the clinic."  Adds Everywoman's board member Kim Zander: "[The clinic] is a  health service that treats women with respect in a dignified environment.  This mural will reinforce the pride with which women fought for and won  the right to choose and now provide this service to women."  Hamilton says she chose to paint many-coloured hollyhocks for the mural  because hollyhocks, which originate from China, are a symbol of women's  ambition.  "I hope the mural will empower the clinic and make it more welcoming  to those who use it. Giving the building a sense of pride and identity can  only strengthen the struggle for women's right to choose what happens  with our bodies," says Hamilton.  Donations in support of the mural can be made at any VanCity Savings  and Credit Union branch to the Vancouver MayWorks Society,  Everywoman's Mural Project, Account #2-44877-9.

(604) 737-1824 email:barb.l@deepcove.c< News  Social programs in Canada:  Public pensions under  review  by Joyce Jones  When Finance Minister Paul Martin released the 1996 federal budget in February, he  continued with his government's plan of dismantling the social safety net in this country.  Last year, it was social programs such as education, healthcare and welfare, and national  standards that were being were being sacrificed. This time around, he announced a proposal for a massive overhaul of the public pension system in Canada.  In his budget speech, Martin outlined the Liberal government's plan to phase out  Old-Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) by the year 2001,  merging them into something called a "Seniors Benefit." (The OAS is universally available to seniors without other public or private pension plans, and the GIS is intended to  top up low-income seniors'pensions so they have at least $900 a month to live on. They are  funded from the general revenues of the federal government.) Likely, in 2001, along with  the merging of the programs will be cuts to funding available to seniors.  The other pension-related announcement Paul Martin presented in his budget was  the establishment of a Commission to review the Canada Pension Plan—a pension plan  funded by employee-employer contributions [see box.] Martin and his government claims  the CPP coffers will soon run dry and the only thing that will "save" it is a massive  overhaul.  Below, Joyce Jones presents some of her critical thoughts about the possible demise of  the public pension system in Canada. Jones recently retired as the executive director of the  Vancouver Second Miles Society, the oldest seniors organization in Vancouver which works  with seniors in the urban core. She is also a volunteer with the 411 Seniors Society.  Canada Pension Plan under attack  The Liberal government was pretty  smooth. By choosing the year 2001 to start  these cuts and to promise that today's pensioners would not be affected was a deliberate effort to bribe us, to neutralize us, so we  would not oppose cuts in pensions for future generations. Apparently, Martin and his  cabinet colleagues believed we would say,  "As long as it does not affect us today, we  don't care what happens to pensioners tomorrow." But today's pensioners will not  adopt such an uncaring attitude.  We fought hard for many years for the  pensions we have today. We sought them not  only for ourselves but for all generations. We  want our children and our grandchildren to  be assured of at least a modicum of the security we enjoy today.  The new "Seniors Benefit" pension will  be based on the combined income of a couple, and then divided by two. Then our pensions will be determined by a "means test."  In many cases it will reduce the incomes of  seniors who will have no way of making up  the lost income.  Drastic changes to pensions may be ten  years away, but before the end of 1996, the  federal government may introduce new legislation regarding the CPP. There is a review  of the CPP going on now and some suggestions are that pensions should be based on a  combined income. This would mean that  women, in a two-income situation, would no  longer receive CPP in their own right, with  the result being that many senior women  would lose their only source of independent  income.  Critics of the CPP believe that persons  should take more responsibility for providing for their own retirement. Their proposals are based on a right-wing ideology that  favour private markets rather than government involvement.  The Reform Party is suggesting a Super RRSP which would be a mandatory  savings scheme and which is based on the  Chilean model that began in 1981. Workers would be required to contribute a percentage of their earnings to a privatized  system, generally with no matching em-  ployer contribution.  Critics of this proposal say that it would  increase contribution rates even higher than  they are now, and as these contributions are  tax-deductible there would be a huge loss of  tax revenue.  The CPP presently has a low administrative cost but in a privatized plan the individual would absorb the cost. Imagine the  competition among the private financial institutions for these funds and the cost of  that marketing being passed on to you, the  purchaser.  The World Bank Policy Research Report  tells us that the marketing costs of these privatized schemes are a particularly sore point,  and that "investment advisors" take a percentage of the retirement fund to help inexperienced investors decide what to do with  it.  Low income workers and women are  particularly disadvantaged by mandatory  private savings schemes simply because they  cannot afford to contribute the expected percentage of their earnings. Although women  have come a long way, generally speaking  we still earn less, take time out of the paid  work force to bear and raise children, and  often retire early to care for elderly or disabled family members.  And to assume younger women will automatically be able to save up for their retirement years and be able to continue to live  in the way to which they have been accustomed, is a real fallacy. Raising children,  putting them through school, low-waged  jobs, and so on, leaves many women with  little or no money left to put into a private  retirement savings plan.  It's been a part of our history to fight  for social security programs for many, many  years. The government seems to have a goal  of wiping out these programs entirely. The  cutbacks will keep coming until, eventually,  there is nothing left to cut.  Radical changes to the existing retirement income system should not be undertaken without informed public debate. The  challenge will be to understand how the  public pension system works and how important it is to your financial security in retirement.  by Wei Yuen Fong and  wendy lee kenward  In mid-April, a panel of federal and  provincial politicians began holding public hearings in about 17 cities across  Canada to solicit Canadian's views on the  Canada Pension Plan.  The Commission is soliciting opinions  on proposed solutions to the funding crisis of the CPP, suggested in a federal-provincial discussion paper released in February. The paper proposed four ways of  "fixing" the CPP: raising employee/employer contributions to CPP; reducing the  benefits given to seniors by increasing the  eligibility rate from 65 to 67 years of age,  and removing the inflation protection;  adopting a more aggressive investment  plan for the CPP reserve fund; or scaling  back benefits to disabled workers.  As Kinesis goes to press, all the  cross-country consultations have been  completed. However, It remains to be seen  whether or not public hearings will be held  in British Columbia. Initially planned to  take place in May, the BC consultations  were put off until the.proyincial election  campaign was completed. Now that the  election is over, it is up to the BC provincial government to request a public hearing, and for the review commission to  agree to hold one, given their time-frame  for completing their report.  However, senior and activist Joyce  Jones challenges the federal governmenf s  approach that would see massive restructuring of the program.Jones says the CPP  is being depleted because of poor management of the program by the federal  government. "The federal government has  used money from the CPP to extend loans  to provinces with no interest returns, and  it has placed many people with disabilities on full CPP, instead of developing  other social programs and income support schemes to support people with disabilities."  Forum planned to counter the attack  In response to the federal and provincial governments' review of the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP), the Trade Union Research Bureau (TURB) and The  Social Planning and Research Council  (SPARC) of BC are organizing a public  forum in Vancouver in mid June, entitled  "Public Pensions Under Review and Under Attack."  The organizers say they are planning  the public education forum because the  general public is being told that CPP must  be radically changed, which may mean: reducing and eliminating benefits, increasing premiums, and privatizing the administration and funding management of CPP.  They add that the coverage in the media  continues to foster myths and distortions  about the public pension system.  The forum is intended to provide people with a space to participate in discussions on the issue of a public pension system, and to work to create community  strategies to respond to the proposed  changes. Round table discussions and plenary sessions will also allow participants  to have oppportunities ta discuss the merits and problems of proposed changes to  the CPP, and actions that can be taken in  response to proposed changes to the CPP.  The keynote speaker will be Monica  Townson, an advocate for CPP and a member of the CPP Advisory Board. Townson  will explain the crucial issues, debunk the  myths, and respond to the political rhetoric in the CPP review debate. Townson is  ' also the author of "Reforming the Canada  Pension Plan: The Implications for  Women," an important document in which  Townson explores the importance of the  CPP to women, analyzes the changes being proposed, and presents alternative  suggestions for improving the CPP for  women.  The forum will also include panel presentations by federal politicians, Svend  Robinson of the New Democratic Party,  Ted McWhinney of the Liberal Party, and  Herb Grubel of the Reform Party on their  political parties' positions on the future of  CPP.  The public forum is being supported  by a number of community and labour  groups. Among them are End Legislated  Poverty, the Greater Vancouver Seniors  Coalition and the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (BC Region).  The one-day conference will be held  on Saturday, June 15 at the Maritime Labour Centre, 1880 Triumph St. in Vancouver. Advanced registration is required, and  the cost is $15 for employed and $5 for  seniors and students. There will be spaces  pie.

JUNE 1996 What's News  by Kinesis writers  Students take  Ottawa by storm  Almost a thousand students and their  supporters marched on Parliament Hill last  month from all over the country to protest  government social spending cuts and the  federal Liberal's Canadian Health and Social Transfer (CHST) which came into effect April 1st.  The rally was the culmination of ten  days of actions and demonstrations organized by the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). Among events over the ten  days were presentations by Linda  McQuaig, debunking the hysteria around  debt and deficit reduction, and Lancefield  Morgan of the CFS on the impact of cuts to  post secondary education.  Protesters came to Ottawa for the final  rally on May 11th by bus and car, repeating a strategy used in the 1930s' " On to  Ottawa Trek," when hundreds of unemployed men tried to ride freight trains to  the capital to demand jobs and establishment of a social safety net.  The protesters of the 90s spoke about  the need to preserve that social safety net  and commemorate the struggle to establish  it in the first place.  Speakers at the rally included Assembly of First Nations Chief Ovide Mercredi  and the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women president Sunera Thobani.  Protesters also reviewed demands  listed in the Alternative Federal Budget  produced by Choices and the Canadian  Centre for Policy Alternatives. In particular, they challenged the federal government  to respond to three demands specific to post  secondary education:  •Bill C-76 be scrapped and funding to  social programs be restored;  •A federal post-secondary-education  act be legislated which would include commitment to an accessible, high quality, publicly funded education system, abolishment  of tuition and user fees and implementation of a national system of grants;  •A progressive taxation system that  targets wealthy Canadians, financial transactions and corporations.  A number of women's groups participated in the trek, said national coordinator  Lucy Watson. First Nations and labour  groups were also present.  The CFS campaign strategy for 1996-  97 continues, and a national day of action  and a number of symposiums are being  planned.  Edmonton Institution  for Women on hold  The new federal jail for women in Edmonton continues to be a nightmare for  prisoners. Since the facility opened in November, seven women attempted escapes  a guard was attacked, and a prisoner has  been charged with second-degree murder  in the hanging death of inmate Denise  Fayant. And now, the federal government  has called for the prisoners to be transferred  out of the facility until new security features can be added.  The facility in Edmonton, like the other  regional facilities, built to replace Kingston's Prison for Women (P4W) houses a  mixture of minimum, medium, and maximum-security prisoners, both provincial  and federal, in a series of cottage-like barracks. Solicitor General Herb Gray says the  escapes are an indication of the need to  heighten security in the prison, even though  the Edmonton facility was originally intended to be less "prison-like" and more  humane than P4W from where the prisoners were transferred.  But a police investigation into the  death of a prisoner has shed new light on  the reason for the escapes. All seven escapes  occurred after the body of Denise Fayant  was found hanging in her cell a day after  her arrival at the new regional prison.  Originally ruled a suicide, the verdict has  been changed to murder and a prisoner  charged.  Kim Pate of Elizabeth Fry Society says  the escapes could have been a result of simple fear rather than loose security.  If the woman charged with Fayant's  murder is convicted, it would be the second recorded in the history of Canadian  women's prisons.  BC's anti-stalking law  extended  A BC supreme court judge has ruled  that the anti-stalking law should apply to  behaviour that creates psychological fear  as well as fear of physical violence. The anti-  stalking legislation, which received mixed  reviews from women's groups when it was  enacted in August 1993, makes it an offense  for someone to harass another person to the  extent that they fear for their safety.  Justice Jack Edwards reversed a provincial court decision that had acquitted  Jackson Chak Hau of stalking Lana Tse. The  provincial court judge had ruled that Hau  did not put Tse in fear of physical violence.  In overturning that decision, Jackson said  the legislation was intended to protect peoples' safety and "there is no limitation restricting that phrase to physical safety, and  clearly a great number of situations which  the section is designed to prevent would  go unpunished should the phrase be interpreted restrictively."  Hau will be retried in a lower court.  Meanwhile, Lee Lakeman of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter and  co-chair of the Male Violence Against  Women Committee of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women says she  doesn't think the broader reading of the  legislation will really help women much.  She points out that police are unwilling to apply the law, especially when it  comes to prosecuting ex-husbands. Positive  change will come if police are ordered to  carry out the law "and reprimanded if they  don't do so," says Lakeman.  She adds that women in BC have been  arguing for an independent review of police for several years now, as well as a federal review of the anti-stalking legislation.  Vernon murder Update  Ajudge has been appointed to review  the role of the RCMP in two Vernon murder cases of women stalked by ex-partners.  While the RCMP is conducting internal investigations of their own into police handling of the cases, the inquiry will be more  in-depth.  Retired BC Court of Appeal Judge  Josiah Wood will conduct the independent  review of events leading up to the murder  of Rajwar Gakhal and her family as well  as the shooting of Sharon Velisek, of  Vernon, BC [see Kinesis, May 1996]. He will  be permitted to interview any persons involved, as well as review all files and documents pertaining to the cases.  Mark Chahal shot himself after killing  his ex-wife Rajwar and eight people in her  family in April. The Gakhals had complained three times about Chahal to Vernon  police and once to Abbotsford police, yet  he managed to obtain restricted weapons  permits from the Burnaby RCMP and later  purchased two handguns for the murders.  Police said the family didn't want charges  laid against Chahal or an investigation,  even though police are required to do so  despite the wishes of the woman.  Velisek says police responded inefficiently to reports of harassment, phone calls  and vandalism she made about her ex-boyfriend Larry Scott, who finally shot her last  November. Scott was never arrested. The  RCMP claim Velisek had not wanted them  to take action against Scott, while Velisek  said she wanted them to.  After his investigation, Judge Wood is  expected to suggest changes to police protocol regarding domestic abuse cases. His  report will go to the RCMP's commanding  officer in BC, deputy commissioner Larry  Proke, who can decide whether or not to  release it to the public. The report is expected to be completed by late summer.  Ul bill passes  Canadians will get lower employment  insurance (UI) rates, will have to work  longer hours in order to be eligible for UI,  and get to draw UI for a shorter time following a House of Commons vote that saw  123 in favour of the Liberal government's  legislation on UI. Eighty MPs voted against  the legislation, largely from the Bloc  Quebecois and Reform Party.  The bill, which must clear Senate before it comes into effect July 1st, has met  with strong opposition from women's, labour and other socially progressive groups  since 1995. Groups in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, where many employees  work seasonally and rely on UI for subsistence, were particularly vocal in their opposition.  The legislation is expected to result in  less than one out of three unemployed  workers being eligible for UI benefits, a rate  of 55 per cent of one's previous salary, and  numerous limits to accessibility and duration.  The change to the legislation, which  will radically alter Canada's social safety  net, is being justified because it is expected  to cut $2 billion from Canada's budget for  social programs.  Public inquiry on  actions of police officer  A Delta police officer who conducted  license plate checks on vehicles belonging to the staff and clients of  Everywoman's Health Clinic denies he is  part of an anti-choice campaign to intimidate and harass abortion service providers. Everywoman's is a free-standing  clinic which provides abortion services to  women in Vancouver.  Constable Steve Parker received a  four-day suspension from the Delta Police after he admitted using RCMP computers to trace names and addresses of  employees of the clinic by looking up  their license plate numbers. The public  inquiry last month has been called to determine whether Parker received adequate discipline for his actions.  At the time Parker used the Canadian  Police Information Centre computer to  look up license plates, Parker was treas  urer of the fundamentalist anti-choice  group, Campaign Life Coalition. The  practice of recording license plate numbers to access names of abortion providers is also a popular tactic among the anti  choice, as advocated in a book by US anti  abortionist Joseph Scheidler, who has spoken at BC Campaign Life meetings.  At the inquest, Parker denied reading Campaign Life literature that recommends looking up license plates for the  names and addresses of people who work  in or use abortion service clinics.  Parker's lawyer argued the four-day  suspension is punishment enough because there is not enough evidence to  demonstrate Parker had passed on the information he gathered on clinic staff and  clients to anyone. Parker says he did nothing with the information which he gathered at the request of his mother, Anita  Parker, Secretary of Campaign Life.  At the inquiry, Anita Parker said  Parker did not pass on any information  to her regarding the identities of the plate  holders. She said she recorded the license  plate numbers of people who were photographing the anti-choicers campaigning  outside Everywoman's Clinic.  The inquest, however, has revealed  that one plate belonged to a woman who  had not parked her car outside the clinic  during the period Parker's mother had recorded plate numbers.  It was the staff members and volunteers at Everywoman's Clinic who had  initially uncovered Parker's abuse of  RCMP computers for anti-choice ends.  They knew anti-choicers had been recording plate numbers, but didn't know what  they were doing with them.  Everywoman's Kim Zander says they  reported the matter to the police, but "The  RCMP and the Delta police did little to  investigate Parker's activities."  Everywoman's put in a Freedom of Information application to get information on  whether their plates had been searched.  Zander believes there could be further information Parker accessed that is  not recorded on the material the clinic  received.  "We think it's only the tip of the iceberg. Given the poor investigation [the  police] did, he could have checked plates  other than the ones he has admitted to  checking," she says.  The inquiry is still in the process of  considering all the evidence. Zander says  the general feeling is a decision will likely  come in early June.

Diverse City Poster Project is launched!  A poster campaign focusing on raising awareness in Asian communities about the discrimination of lesbians, gays and bisexuals was launched  at the Vancouver Art Gallery on May 15th. An initiative of the Asian Society  for the Intervention of AIDS (ASIA), the Diverse City Poster is an important  first project for opening up discussions on homophobia in the East and  South East Asian communities.  On the poster is a group portrait (as shown above) and insets which  includes author Joy Kogawa, Vancouver City Councillors Jenny Wai Ching  Kwan and Maggie Ip, Little Sister's Bookstore's Janine Fuller, Liberal MP  Hedy Fry, West Coast Domestic Workers' Chrisanta Sampang, environmental  activist Dr. David Suzuki, and many others, mixing higher profile politicians,  artists, writers with community activists both straight and queer. Over 110  participants came out in support of tolerance and awareness against  homophobia.  Hopefully this project will start to break down barriers faced by  lesbians, gays and bisexuals in some of the more conservative pockets of  East and South East Asian communities.The poster calls for the elimination  of homophobia in Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese and Korean.  The Diverse City Project is also an attempt to make visible issues surrounding sexuality which often in both Asian communities and families can be  seen as a private issue and something not to be talked about. As coordinator of Diverse City, Henry Koo notes: "[t]he family is most important  for strength and comfort, especially for recent immigrants. But for lesbians,  gays and bisexuals, the family can also be our [place of] least support."  Diverse City was funded by Health Canada and supported by  grassroot groups like Bamboo Triangle (a support group for lesbians, gays,  bisexuals and transgendered persons of Japanese descent); the Battered  Women's Support Services; Gay Asians of Vancouver Area (GAVA); the  human rights group of the Vancouver Association of Chinese Canadians;  the Human Rights Committee of the Japanese Canadian Citizen's Association; and the Gay and Lesbian Centre.The Planning Committee hopes that  another portrait for Diverse City can be taken in five or more years to reflect  the need for this form of education as an ongoing process.  The poster, designed by Lotus Miyashita, is being distributed through  the ASIA/ASAP (Asian Support Aids Program) office at 507-1033 Davie  Street, Vancouver V6E 1M7; telephone (604) 669-5567 or fax (604) 669-7756.

Since the 1992 OutRights Conference in  Vancouver, there hasn't been an opportunity to dialogue with each other on a grassroots level, when issues which affect members of all four communities can be presented and discussed.  To facilitate this dialogue, Joyce Grigg,  a Toronto lesbian community activist, proposed a three-day national conference and  celebration to be held in conjunction with  Toronto's Pride Week in 1997 (tentatively  scheduled for the week of June 23-28) as  almost a quarter of a million people converge in the city for the Pride celebrations  and march. The theme of the LGBT 1997  conference is Forward to Freedom, in recognition of the need to pay respect to how far  we have come "while not being there yet."  The proposed objectives for the conference are: 1) To provide a forum for dialogue on: a) issues including amendments  to the Canadian Human Rights Act, same-  sex relationship recognition, immigration  and health; and b) grassroots issues including homophobia and heterosexism from  elected officials, the police and the justice  systems, in education and in the delivery  of social programs. 2) To continue to build  networks for LGBT groups and facilitate the  sharing of resources and expertise, crosscountry alliance-building and increased  participation in LGBT organizations. 3) To  develop a voice for LGBT issues directed  to federal politicians.  The draft proposal for the conference  suggests the formation of a steering team  which would represent all regions of  Canada as well as the diversity within the  communities, while ensuring gender parity. The organizers are also looking to set  up a consulting group, and various committees to work on conference planning,  logistics, marketing and communications  outreach, fundraising, and entertainment.  The draft proposal was prepared by an acting steering team comprised of members  of the Canadian Human Rights Campaign,  the Coalition for Lesbian & Gay Rights in  Ontario, Equality for Gays & Lesbians Everywhere (EGALE,) KHUSH (gay South  Asians), Parents and Friends of Lesbians &  Gays National Organization (P-FLAG,) and  the Canadian Labour Congress.

New research on  traffic in women  The trafficking of women within, and  through Thailand, as well as the effectiveness of interventions to stop it, has been  the focus of a three-year intensive investigation by researchers at the Thailand-  based Foundation for Women (FFW.)  Their conclusion is that traffic in women  is a growing business and attempts to  control it have largely failed.  From the outset, the research team  drew a distinction between trafficking  and ordinary labour migration. Trafficking was clearly defined by its use of force  or deceit, as well as transportation from  one region to another. They also established that in Thailand, the predominant  purpose for trafficking of women and  children is for prostitution, though domestic labour, factory work and the mailorder bride business also play significant  roles in the growth of this criminal industry.  Recruiting women and girls for prostitution is fiercely competitive. In the rural regions investigated, trafficking agents  were usually local people or relatives and  friends of the villagers, and they recruited  directly from the villages. This is a change  from the 1960s and 1970s, when women  moved to urban areas to find work and  were forced into the sex industry once  there. In the past decade the shadow of  the AIDS virus has resulted in a greater  demand for women who are perceived to  be free of infection. Women from remote  areas and younger women have become  prime targets for traffickers.  A second recent development reported by FFW was that women were  being moved directly to other countries,  instead of first serving a period of time in  the nightclubs and brothels of Bangkok  and Pattaya. The predominant routes of  trafficking to foreign countries tend to  follow the channels of sex tourists. The  greatest number of sex tourists to Thailand come from Japan, Germany and Taiwan, and these countries have become the  predominant destinations for most  women moved out of Thailand.  Typically, governments have responded to the crime of cross-border trafficking by clamping down on illegal immigrants. However, researchers found  that this has had little or no effect on the  trafficking process itself as new ways continue to be found to get women and girls  across borders and into "work." Furthermore, industry operators use the threat of  arrest to restrict the free movement of the  women and to control their working conditions in their new locations.  In discussing the findings, the research team pointed to a number of contributing factors, including: that part of  the Thailand tourism industry makes  money from sex tours; that there are labour export and import policies which  encourage the exchange of cheaper labour  between countries in order to keep production costs low, and that the gender  division of labour closes off other occupations to women.  Central to the recommendations arising from the research is a call for the establishment of a national office to ensure  that action against trafficking is well coordinated, and which would make a concerted effort to implement policies in immigration, social welfare, labour, tourism  and the justice system to bring an end to  this crime against women. Cooperation  between governments and NGOs is also  essential to ensure that procurers, agents  and other beneficiaries of this trade are  prosecuted, and that women who have  been trafficked are given assistance.  The recommendations have been released in a publication of the Foundation  for Women titled Recommendations to Combat International Traffic in Women.

Ash  Women's health activists have long sought  to look at impacts of the broader social environment in women's health, looking beyond  the individualized approach often taken by the  mainstream, of examining individual women's  lifestyle "choices".  Activism around breast cancer has been  growing in the 1990s, and concerned women  are now looking at evidence of a connection  between some common chemicals in the environment and the increasing incidence of breast  cancer.  This conjunction of women's health and  environmental concerns was seen at a public  forum held in Vancouver this past March. The  forum was organized by the Vancouver Women's Health Collective and the Georgia Strait  Alliance (GSA), an environmental group which  has a "No Toxics" campaign.  The forum was titled, "An Ounce of Prevention: Women's Health and the Environment." GSA toxics campaigner Miranda  Holmes, one of the forum organizers, said the  title "sprang immediately to mind, because an  ounce or a gram of prevention really is worth  more than continuing to throw trillions of dollars at a cure which may never be found."  The organizers say the event was intended  to be a public education forum about the impact of toxic chemicals on women health, and  in particular on how chemicals affect us, how  we can reduce our exposure, and how we can  work for their elimination from our environment.  The forum featured three panelists: Devra  Lee Davis and Ana Soto, two American scientists researching the relationship between  breast cancer and toxins, and Sharon Batt, a  breast cancer survivor and activist.  The scientific  evidence  Dr. Devra Lee Davis and Dr. Ana Soto both  spoke on the evidence linking hormone-mimicking chemicals, called xenoestrogens, with  breast cancer.  Davis, a Senior Fellow in Health and Environment at the World Resources Institute in  Washington, DC, gave an introduction to the  issue of the increasing incidence of breast cancer. Davis noted the incidence rate today is  given as a chance of one in eight women (or  one in nine in Canada). Twenty years ago, it  was one in 20. Only some of the increase can  be attributed to women living longer and only  10 percent of breast cancer can be attributed to  inheritance, according to Davis.  Davis said the causes of fifty percent of  breast cancers are still unknown, but of the  known risk factors, almost all are related to  estrogen. Estrogen, produced in the ovaries, is  the primary hormone of the female reproductive system. Women have estrogen receptors  in the breasts, uterus, and vagina. Estrogen  causes breast cells to grow, but the accumulation of too much estrogen—or a chemical that  mimics estrogen—can lead to cell proliferation  and possibly tumour formation.  Davis explained that there are different  kinds of estrogen and that not all xenoestrogens  are bad. Natural ones, such as those found in  certain vegetables, have positive effects, while  synthetic xenoestrogens, for example those  found in pesticides, are likely to be harmful.  Ana Soto, a scientist in the Department of  Anatomy and Cellular Biology at Tufts University in Boston, took the subject further by describing how, during the course of some research she was conducting in 1987, she made a  surprise finding. She discovered that breast  cells she was studying were growing even  though there was no addition of estrogen—or  so she thought.  On investigation, Soto says she determined that estrogen-mimicking chemicals  were leaking from plastic tubes and were supplying blood product to the cells, making them  grow. The test tube supplying company told  Soto it had recently changed its formula for the  plastic used in the tubes to make it more flexible, but would not reveal the composition of  two plastics saying it was a "trade secret."  Soto and her co-workers eventually identified the xenoestrogen as nonylphenol, a  chemical found not only in plastics but in detergents, pesticides, and spermicides. In her research, published in 1991, Soto demonstrated  that human breast tissue grows in the presence  of nonylphenol./7f is interesting to note that Soto's  research gained prominence when she was featured  in a 1995 documentary on CBC-TV, "Sex Under  Siege," which focused on the relationship between  environmental toxins and declining sperm count  and deformities of male genitals, and not on the implications of xenoestrogens on women's health.]  These "xenoestrogenic" chemicals, some  of which are organochlorines (carbon and chlorine-based) such as DDT [dichloro-diphenyl-  trichloro-ethane] and other pesticides, have  been introduced in the last 50 years. DDT has  been banned in NorthAmerica since the 1970s,  but is still used in many countries, particularly  in southern countries.  Soto said that only a small number of these  chemicals have been screened for hormonal  links, and that there is no data on exposure, so  it isn't known what is a safe level of exposure  to xenoestrogens.  Devra Lee Davis also noted that it is hard  to get scientific data on people; for example,  pesticide chemicals are everywhere but it is  hard to measure exposure. Much data comes  from studies of wildlife, which have been experiencing defects in their reproductive systems. Examples of alligators with peruses too  small for reproduction were cited by both scientists.  In her talk, Davis argued that the question, "How much evidence do you need before you take action?" is not a scientific question, but one of policy. Establishing incontrovertible scientific proof that a chemical is harmful is a lengthy and sometimes unsuccessful  process—scientists would always like more  evidence. Davis said that whether a chemical  should be restricted if there is any risk shown,  and whether the burden of proof should be on  showing that a chemical is not harmful, is a  political matter. She concluded that it is up to  all people to demand healthy environments,  the right to know what chemicals are in the  environment, and the screening of chemicals  for risk.  Ana Soto said she is continuing to research  nonylphenol and other chemicals for their  estrogen-mimicking qualities. In concluding  her presentation, she recommended that four  steps be taken: 1) screen chemicals for  estrogenicity; 2) explore cumulative effects; 3)  set protocols to measure blood levels (that is,  set up a system for testing); and 4) identify  markers of exposure.  At the forum, a good deal of scientific information was presented, some of it quite technical and difficult to absorb in a short time.  However, a package of written materials was  distributed so forum participants could get  more background knowledge at their own  pace. [The package is available from the forum organizers. See contact information below.]  Breast cancer  activism  The third panelist of the forum was Sharon  Batt, a breast cancer survivor and activist, and  author of Patient No More. She spoke all too  briefly, as the forum had run over time. She  opened by describing how in 1988, at the age  of 43, she was diagnosed with breast cancer-  one of 15,000 Canadian women diagnosed that  year.  Her experience left her struck by the  "primitive" treatments, which, she said, "may  help you if they don't kill you first." Batt said  she took it on herself to research the causes of  breast cancer, but that she was stymied in her  search for more information. Canada, she  found, has one of the highest rates of breast  cancer in the world, with mortality rates steady  and the incidence rate rising.  Batt began to be politicized after she read  a New Yorker article on electromagnetic fields  and cancer. Researchers had been systematically blocked, unable to obtain funding to further look into the link.  Another influence that led her to become  an activist was a televison program on women  with breast cancer. The show had an upbeat  tone, and made no mention of the number of  women who were dying. At that same time in  Montreal, where she lives, the 5th International  AIDS Conference was taking place. Batt said  she was struck by the contrast of this TV show  encouraging women to take a "chipper" attitude towards breast cancer and the activism  and anger of PWAs (Persons Living with  AIDS.)  "Something snapped in me, and from that  moment on I was an activist." In the years since,  a breast cancer movement has developed,  which has raised awareness about the disease.  In Canada, there is now a National Breast Cancer Network. Breast cancer activists in Boston  managed to get $1 million transferred from the  military budget to breast cancer research and  support, through their "Breasts Not Bombs"  campaign.  Activism has also shifted attitudes. "We  want a prevention-oriented approach," said  Batt. In the medical community which is hierarchical and which wants clinical trials and  quantifiable data, there is a treatment-oriented  approach, rather than a preventative one. "Of  course we are interested in better treatments,"  she said, but much money has been spent on  developing chemotherapy treatments over the  years, without much success, and she believes  a different approach is needed. "At the very  least, we have the right to know what chemicals are in the environment."  "Time For Prevention" an unauthorized parody of a cover article in  Time Magazine on breast cancer  (but not on the link to environmental toxins). Designed by Matuschka.  A Time Life Production in collaboration with Greenpeace, 1994.  The issue of how women respond to their  cancer and how they are encouraged to minimize and hide its impact, was raised again  during the discussion period. Batt responded  that a positive outlook is helpful, but that it  needs to be balanced with the acknowledgement of negative realities. Batt described how  there is a systematic encouragement of "positive" attitudes through prosthesis and makeup programs (supported by the Canadian Cancer Society), which bothers her given the lack  of other programs such as emotional support  and prevention. Batt said it's a political issue  that women are encouraged to hide their cancer, reducing the visibility of the increasing incidence of breast cancer.  Many of the questions from women attending the forum concerned what they could  do individually to prevent chemical exposure  and cancer, rather than as a participant in a  social movement. Some individual advice was  given: for example, Ana Soto recommended  that women not to heat food in plastics (that is,  in microwaves,) because it increases the likelihood of chemicals leaching into the food.  The forum's intention, however, was to  help build public concern and activism around  issues of cancer and environmental toxins. To  that end, follow-up organizing meetings were  held in April in Vancouver.

JUNE 1996  9 NAC President Sunera Thobani leaves a legacy:  a NAC for  as told to  Fatima Jaffer and Agnes Huang  In June, Sunera Thobani steps down as  president of the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC), the largest coalition of women's organizations in the world.  Thobani was acclaimed president at the NAC  annual general meeting three years ago. She is  the first woman of colour president of NAC.  Before being appointed president, Thobani  had represented BC women on the NAC executive for two years, and had worked with various  women's groups including the Vancouver Status of Women and SAWAN (the South Asian  Women's Action Network.)  Kinesis spoke with Thobani in Vancouver  the day before the NAC-CLC (Canadian Labour  Congress) National Women's March on Poverty  left Vancouver for its cross-country trek to Ottawa.  Agnes Huang: You're stepping down a  year early in your second term. Why is that?  Sunera Thobani: I think I've accomplished  some of the things I set out to do. I've done as  much as I think I am able to do and given as  much as I can politically.  Fatima Jaffer: Could you tell us how NAC  has evolved during your presidency?  Thobani: I believe the organization has  undergone a major transformation since my  first NAC meeting, five years ago. Then, I was  the only woman of colour present. There's a  very strong woman of colour focus now, particularly in BC. There are also many more  Aboriginal women in NAC now. The membership has also increased since I became  president. We had 550 member organizations  when I started out. Today we have 670.  The issues have also changed considerably. Our focus has been on the increasing  poverty of women in this country. When I  became president, we had a campaign around  the federal election because we wanted the  parties to [state] where they stood on women's issues. Since then, we've taken on issues  of women's poverty, social programs in  Canada, and women's economic and social  rights.  But because representation of various  groups of women has changed inside NAC,  the focus of these issues has also changed. For  example, the Liberal government's racist head  tax [the $975 landing fee] was central to our  campaign for women's economic and social  rights, rather than a marginal side issue.  Another example is that this is the first  time in Canada a [cross-Canada] woman's  march against poverty has been organized. It  is the first time NAC has attempted to mobilize women on the ground. This march is intended to bring new groups of women into  NAC, especially young women.  Our approach has been very different  under the women of colour caucus of the  NAC executive, which has spearheaded the  organizing of the march. We are trying to shift  from being a professional elitist organization  that [puts] out media stars, to strengthening  the organization on the ground—that's where  we are a movement; that's where we have the  most effect and that's where respect has to be  created. We have tried to make the leadership  accountable. Our focus has been on building  a movement. The women's march is the culmination of the work done over the last three  years.  Jaffer: Do you believe you have achieved  what you set out to do three years ago, when  you said you would make NAC a more  regionally accountable movement, less top-  heavy and Toronto-centric? You have been living in Toronto and working within NAC's  top-heavy structure, rather than directly in a  women's centre. Has NAC really opened up?  Thobani: I see that work as having moved  forward a little. I don't think NAC has resolved the issues of representation or of democratization, or that NAC is now an anti-  racist organization. My presidency has only  put these issues on the table. I want to be optimistic about whether NAC can rise to the  challenge of resolving them, but that depends  a great deal on who will be the next president and where she will take the work.  Some of the changes made in the past  three years will last, such as the strengthening of the regions and the structures we've  put into place. There's no doubt about that—  it would take major time to undo them if  somebody wanted to. But NAC has only taken  the first few steps. It now has to meet the challenge of truly becoming an anti-racist organization or becoming a historically bankrupt  organization.  Huang: One concern about the NAC-CLC  national women's march is that it's a top-  down endeavour, with the decisions being  made in Toronto and the work coming from  the communities. On the other hand, there has  also been tremendous support for the march  from women in rural areas. Could you comment?  Thobani: There's no question that the en-v  thusiasm for the march actually comes from  the membership. Last year, the Quebec Women's March ended at the NAC AGM [see Kinesis July/August 1995.] Women from centres  across Canada at the AGM were inspired by  the Quebec march. They realized the need for  something to revitalize the women's movement. That feeling was also clearly present at  the CLC women's convention last year.  Originally, we had planned the march for  1997. That would have given the regional  NAC representatives one-and-a-half years to  prepare. It would mean the work on the  ground would be strengthened by the time  the march began.  Then we started to get indications from  the federal government that they may go into  an election in the fall of 1996 or spring of 1997.  It didn't seem worth the risk to wait until 1997  to find out. It was crucial this march take place  before the election because after an election,  it would be much less effective. That's why  the decision to move the march forward came  from the NAC executive. And because everything has been sped up, the regions have  not felt included.  Our other concern was that, in April  1997, the Canadian constitution is going to  be back on the table. We thought the march  would re-mobilize and strengthen the women's movement, leaving us in a stronger position to be part of next year's constitutional  debates.  Huang: There has been a lot of backlash  against NAC, not just externally from the corporate media, for example, but also from  mainstream and broader women's organizations. The main concern appears to be NAC's  role and its relevancy, and a lot of the attacks  have been directed at you personally. Could  you comment?  Thobani: You cannot have an organization that is not relevant and yet is able to organize something like the National Women's  March Against Poverty. The marchers are  scheduled to be welcomed in over 80 towns,  cities and villages across Canada. The activities planned for the marchers in these communities are not being planned for an organi-  March 14th, Vancouver, B.C: the send-off.

It's been extremely frustrating for me to hear the  backlash at a time when the organization is  growing stronger on the ground and is  becoming more financially stable.  zation that is dead or not relevant. An irrelevant organization does not pull the kind of  clout NAC has to get the federal finance minister to sit down and discuss the demands of  the march.  It's been extremely frustrating for me to  hear the backlash at a time when the organization is growing stronger on the ground and  is becoming more financially stable. I inherited a $75,000 deficit and I'm going to the  AGM this year with a balanced budget. Two  years ago, NAC was the only national organization willing to put itself on the line and call  the Reform Party an extremist, racist, homophobic, sexist party Today, we stand fully vindicated. At the 4th World Conference on  Women in Beijing, NAC emerged as a key and  respected player in the international feminist  arena. NAC never had that kind of standing  before.  If a white woman president had achieved  all these things, everybody in the country  would recognize them as major accomplishments for NAC. But because a white woman  is not at the helm of NAC, we continue to  experience racist backlash. Much of what  NAC has achieved in the last three years has  been invalidated.  It shows the level of racism in this society and within the women's community as  well. One example is Reform MP Jan Brown's  resignation because of some members of the  Reform Party's [extremist views]—none of the  media has come to NAC to acknowledge,  "You were the first to denounce the Reform  Party." Another example is Pamela Martin's  show on BCTV on the women's march last  month—they called in two white women [to  be interviewed,] neither of whom were NAC  representatives.  But while racism certainly plays a key  part in [NAC's treatment] by the corporate  media, the issue is more complicated—there  has also been a real backlash against "special  interest groups." These groups are defined as  anyone who offers a different vision for  Canada, a vision that opposes the right-wing  agenda.  movement  building  Sunera Thobani [at centre] with Nancy Riche, vice-president of the Canadian Labour Congress [at left]. Photo by Fatima Jaffer.  The third factor is the pitting of organized groups against individuals—the idea  that speaking to an individual is somehow  more valid and legitimate than speaking to  organizations made up of these individuals,  groups which actually have experience working on these issues. We saw this most clearly  in the last federal election where the CBC began holding "town hall meetings" to which  they invited "real Canadians" to speak with  authority on various issues.  I believe the media shutout of NAC is  happening because, after the Charlottetown  [constitutional accord] referendum in 1992  and the high-profile media campaign NAC  ran at the time, there has been a conscious  attempt by the media and the power elite to  ensure no group will ever have that kind of  space again.  Jaffer: What have been the most challenging and/or successful battles for NAC during your presidency?  Thobani: The most challenging has been  the resistance to transformation in general. I  knew that would be difficult but I didn't realize how difficult.  The most successful battle has been  around the federal election campaign where  NAC was successful in getting some attention paid to the extremist and undemocratic  character of the Reform Party. I think the work  we did in Beijing is also a success.  But for me personally, success is having  women, particularly immigrant women who  cannot speak a word of English, stop me on  the street and say, "We're so glad that NAC  speaks for us." Their having that kind of ownership of an organization is incredible. I've  been an immigrant most of my adult life, and  when I was in Britain and in the US, I never  felt anything in society spoke to me or had  any space for me. [For me]the major accomplishment of my presidency is that I have  reached out to women who feel connection  to me and to NAC.  Jaffer: What are the toughest challenges  women in Canada and NAC in particular will  face in the next few years?  Thobani: The next president will have to  deal with a federal election this or next year.  The other crucial issue will be the future of  the country. NAC has held the Three Nations  position [English, French and First Nations]  which has come into question over the last  year because of the contradictions in that position. The Tri-Nation position fudges the fact  that two of the nations have colonized Abo  riginal people. By saying "three nations," we  wipe out that whole history of colonization.  There have been major debates within  NAC on this. Women of colour have challenged this position because we feel the issue  of Aboriginal women and Aboriginal rights  should not be tied to what happens between  Quebec and the rest of Canada. Aboriginal  peoples' right to self-determination is inherent. It should stand alone regardless of everything else.  There is a resolution going to the June  AGM that commits NAC to having a crosscountry consultation with its membership  next year. We want to look at what NAC's  Three Nations position means today—do the  "nations" have complementary claims or  competing ones? We saw during the Quebec  referendum [last fall] how the rights of the  Cree Nation conflicted with Quebec's claim,  for example.  Huang: There is cynicism and depression  over the state of the women's movement in  general. As someone who works in a feminist organization, I have to say it's really hard.  What are your thoughts on where the movement's at?  Thobani: The state of the women's movement [reflects what's going on not only inside but also outside the women's movement]. Both nationally and globally, we are  living in a time where there are no political  alternatives available to progressive people  in this country. There is no radically different  political vision for our country. Certainly, all  of the political parties, whether willingly or  unwillingly, have accepted that globalization  is inevitable, accepted that the destruction of  our social programs is inevitable. Part of our  sense of despair and harshness comes from  knowing there are no easy political alternatives right now.  The biggest challenge the women's  movement faces right now is to find a way,  given our existing political systems and structures, of presenting an alternative. The women's movement has a different political vision.  We need to put time, energy and resources  into building the institutions and putting the  structures in place which can actually help  the women's movement present our political  alternative. We must try to revitalize, energize and strengthen ourselves on the ground.  This is hard to do, as you say, at a time  when the shift to the Right has been so complete, and when there are no political alternatives. I think something like the National  Two years ago,  NAC was the only  national organization  willing to put itself on  the line and call the  Reform Party an  extremist, racist,  homophobic, sexist  parly. Today, we stand  fully vindicated.  Women's March can really revitalize and energize women. It will certainly be very empowering for the women participating.  Huang: Are you at all afraid the march  won't go as planned?  Thobani: I am less worried now because  I know 80 communities across Canada have  organized to welcome and rally with marchers. This is a movement that's alive. It's actually drawing women in. Whether we'll have  a million women out at Tent City in Ottawa  [where the march will wind up,] I think that's  become less relevant now. It is a success that  the march has been able to mobilize that kind  of energy across the country. That on-the-  ground connection across the country means  to me that women still feel faith in the women's movement.  Huang: Some women have concerns  about the relationship between NAC and the  labour movement. There are progressive elements within the labour movement but there  are also extremely conservative elements.  How do you see NAC building future partnerships with organizations that are not necessarily feminist?  Thobani: Right now, politically, it is important for the labour movement to have  come out in support of the women's march  because the march's demands are feminist  demands. To have gotten their support for the  demands means they have accepted a feminist agenda for the march.  I'm not sure whether the relationship  between the labour and women's movements  can be strengthened and maintained. NAC  and the labour movement are at the beginning of this kind of relationship. Organizing  the march together has actually created space  inside the labour movement for feminists to  really try to set the agenda. It has strengthened the position of feminists inside the labour movement.  The march is also having an impact because the women of colour inside the labour  movement are connecting with NAC in a way  they haven't before. They are looking at the  changes we're bringing to NAC and that will  strengthen the anti-racist work they've been  trying to do inside the labour movement.  Huang: So you see it as a positive relationship rather than one that could be restrictive?  Thobani: It has the potential to be a positive relationship. Certain aspects of the organizing for the march have not been easy. We  come from different cultures—the feminist  movement is different from the labour movement. Sometimes our ways run up against  each other, but that struggle has to happen.  One of the things NAC brought in is the  issue of representation. At every level, NAC  has a commitment that women of colour will  be on all of the committees. One of our demands was getting a woman of colour to be  the national coordinator for the march. I think  the labour movement will learn from things  like that.  From NAC's perspective, working with  labour has strengthened some of the anti-poverty work we do. It has also made us really  look at women's working conditions. So it  does have the potential to be a mutually beneficial relationship. Thaf s the hope we've had  going into this march. If it doesn't prove to  be true, NAC will learn from it.  Huang: Is NAC committed to ensuring  the next president is a woman of colour or  First Nations woman so that she can continue  the work you began?  Thobani: I certainly hope so. The issue of  representation and accountability today is key  to any organization or social movement, par-  ticularly with the globalization of the  economy that is taking place. Our political  perspectives have to change because the  struggles we are encountering are no longer  domestic or national alone.  If the anti-racist work we've tried to do  is put on the back burner, NAC will be limited in the steps it takes to go forward into  the next century. It will become more elitist.  Meanwhile, the backlash against women of  colour is going to become stronger. I certainly  hope NAC will move in the right direction.  Huang: Are you planning to stay involved in NAC?  Thobani: I'll stay on the NAC executive  as past president, and I'll work with the  women of colour caucus.  Huang: What are your plans for the future?  Thobani: I will hold the Ruth Wynn  Woodward chair of women's studies at Simon  Fraser University for the next two years [starting in September.] Politically, I will work  closely with women of colour organizations  in Vancouver. I also want to look closely at  the changes we tried to make in NAC—what  worked, what didn't, the strengths and weaknesses of how we tried to make changes. It  would help the organization to have that kind  of analysis. Also, the issue of democratic alternatives is key in the women's movement  and we have to figure that out.  The biggest challenge  the women's movement  faces right now is to  find a way, given our  existing political  systems and structures,  of presenting an  alternative. The  women's movement  has a different  political vision. Feature  National Women's March Against Poverty:  Taking off across BC  End of the first week: group shot in Canmore, Alberta of the women who joined the caravan in Vancouver, Burns Lake and Calgary.  by Fatima Jaffer   Line-up in Kamloops for one of the most popular vehicles on the march—  the WOW (Women on Wheels) rolling feminist library truck. Women could  get two free books and all the pamphlets, magazines, posters (and Kinesis)  they wanted.  There are many stories of the national  women's march against poverty that descends on Canada's capital, Ottawa on June  15—too many to tell, some better left untold, others that did not begin with this  march but much much earlier.  There is the story of women marchers  departing New Brunswick and Newfoundland; the story of women joining the march  from central BC; the story of the 30 or so  caravaneers who left Vancouver May 14, of  whom I was one. There are stories of growing pains, and stories of the courage and  initiative of the marchers. Perhaps the most  important story, however, is of the generous, committed women in various communities, towns and cities who met the  caravaneers on their cross-country trek.  I was only present for week one of the  march, from Vancouver to Calgary. In that  time, I learnt a lot. In our daily process/  logitistics meetings, women on the march  and our hosts in various places talked about  the agendas that threw them together on  this, the journey of their lives—movement  building, and bringing personal and political messages of how poverty affects  women, how globalization of the economy  and the Liberal government's policies further entrench our poverty. There were  women whc came to learn more about the  women's movement, and those who came  to renew their faith and commitment in it.  In all, the caravaneers will participate  in 80 communities across the country. The  following photo-essay tells the story of  communities we passed through that first  week on the leg going east. While our zig-  zaggy route through rural BC and Alberta  brought us to Langley, Mission, Kamloops,  Vernon, Kelowna, Penticton, Nelson,  Cranbrook, Golden, and Canmore and  Calgary in Alberta, time and space restrictions allow me to tell only a few of those  stories.

In particular, Davis tells the story  of the legal battle the centre  just fought to hold onto the  confidential files of a  woman fighting a rape case.  The centre had refused to  disclose the records, only  relenting after the court  threatened to shut the  centre down by financially  breaking it.  Women from Quesnel, Vancouver and Burns Lake who began the march in  Burn's Lake, in central BC, joined the eastward caravan in Kamloops.  Women from the Penticton & Area Women's Centre were awaiting our arrival  to hold a Take Back The Night March down the main street protesting violence against women. We heard how in the last couple of months, there had  been three brutal rapes, including a gang rape, that had received little  attention from the local media or police. We also heard how racism and  poverty were central issues faced by women in the area.  Photo by Mary Daniels.

Commentary  Lesbian and gay rights legislative changes:  Meaningful laws need  only apply  by barbara findlay  This is a test. What piece of legislation  passed in the last two months will affect  the lives of lesbians, bisexuals and gay men  the most?  Would it be the enactment of protection against discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation in the Canadian Human  RightsAct(CHRA)?  To hear the mewling and puking of  Reform Party members about the godless  road ahead, one could be forgiven for thinking this addition was a major victory. To  discover that the Liberal government was  forsaking its gelatinous principles and allowing a free vote among Liberal caucus  members on the proposed amendment, one  might have had that opinion confirmed.  And finally, to see [New Democratic Party  Member of Parliament (MP)] Svend  Robinson and EGALE's [Equality for Gays  and Lesbians Everywhere] John Fisher heralding the enactment as a milestone in Canadian history...well, who then could argue  with the significance of this event in queer  legal history?  But if it was not the enactment of sexual  orientation protection in the CHRA, then  what was the most important piece of legislation recently introduced that furthers  the rights of lesbians and gay men in  Canada?  Perhaps it was the amendments to the  BC Adoption Act which permit same sex  partners to adopt children as a couple. You  might well wonder "what amendments to  the Adoption Act?," as the amendments  were slipped into law without much notice given or taken.  Changes were made to the BC's adoption legislation last fall, making BC the first  jurisdiction in the world to legislate same-  sex couple adoption (in other places, it has  been the courts who have permitted them).  But the legislation, which was passed amid  a firestorm of controversy fanned by the  provincial Reform Party, was not pro-  claimed-that is, it did not become law-resulting in the legislation being left meaning absolutely nothing.  But on April 18, quietly, with no press  release, no all candidates meetings trumpeting the result, the Adoption Act was  proclaimed to come into force...in November. After the provincial election is well and  truly over.  The Canadian Human Rights Act  amendments and the BC Adoption Act  amendments are a study in contrasts. The  former was hurrah'ed with great fanfare  from coast to coast, but means nothing; the  latter was proclaimed quietly while BC was  otherwise occupied, but means a very great  deal.  The only thing that the amendments  have in common is that the legislatures in  both cases are running against form, precisely because the issue is gay rights. (In  other circumstances, the Liberal govern  ment would not have allowed a free vote  and the BC NDP government would have  taken credit for what they did.)  The federal government is trying to  take credit for a change the courts had already made, while denying that protecting  lesbians and gays has anything to do with  our relationships. Meanwhile, the BC provincial government tiptoes through a revolutionary change for lesbians, bisexuals,  gay men and our families, unwilling to  bring it to voters' attention, lest it become  an election issue.  The story on the federal changes to the  Canadian Human Rights Act is this: In 1992,  the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the  CHRA was unconstitutional, because in  failing to protect lesbians, bisexuals and gay  men from discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation, the CHRA was in breach  of the equality provisions of the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms. This was an astounding result-finding that the federal human  rights legislation was itself discriminatory.  The remedy ordered by the Court was  that henceforth the Canadian Human  Rights Act should be read as if it contained  protection for lesbians, bisexual people and  gay men against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The courts had done it; no legislative  changes were required. Even when the federal Justice Minister Allan Rock met with  the December 9 Coalition, a working coalition on lesbian, bisexual, gay and  transgender rights, in March 1993, he acknowledged that a change to the CHRA  would be legally meaningless window  dressing having an entirely symbolic value.  Rock asked the coalition if it wanted  the CHRA changed or if he should focus  on other issues. People in the room were  unanimous that the focus should be on real,  not merely symbolic, changes.  But Rock did not tell his caucus or the  country that the courts had already  changed the law for lesbians and gay men.  Nor did he tell them that the amendments  were a merely a symbolic act on the part of  his government.  His silence instead opened up the  floodgates for a sustained and vocal furor  in Ottawa over inclusion of sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination, generated by the likes of Liberal MPs  Rosanne Skoke and Tom Wappel and several Reform Party MPs.  So great was their homophobic fury, so  great was Prime Minister Jean Chretien's  fear that members of his caucus would vote  against the bill anyway, that ultimately,  when May 1st arrived and it was time to  vote on the amendment, Liberal Party MPs  were permitted a free vote, because this was  a "matter of conscience."  Chretien had sneered at Bob Ringma,  the Reformer who was eventually suspended by his party for his racist and anti-  The federal government  is trying to take credit  for a change the courts  had already made, while  denying that protecting  lesbians and gays has  anything to do with our  relationships.  gay remarks, while permitting his own caucus members to vote against the amendments. When the tally was taken, 23 Liberals-including Skoke and Wappel-and all  Reformers except one had voted against the  amendment.  But even more sleezy than the free vote,  was Rock's characterization of the bill. Rock  claimed that the change would have no  impact on the same-sex benefits, which is  what the right-wing homophobes were predicting would happen. He knew it wasn't  true. The change does and will support the  claims for same-sex benefits of lesbians and  gay men employed in the federal private  sector and by the federal government. The  Supreme Court of Canada said so when it  held inEgan and Nesbit that discrimination  against a gay couple by refusing to provide  them with a spousal benefit was discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationfsee  Kinesis July/August 1995.]  My partner Sheila Gilhooly maintains  that the changes to the CHRA are important, precisely for their symbolic value-^so  much fuss has been made that every Canadian, including lesbians and gay men who  get their information about their own lives  from the straight media, must now know  that lesbians and gay men have civil rights.  I agree with the effect. But I cannot agree  that the end justified the lies and misrepresentations that the Liberals made on the  issue.  Meanwhile, back in BC, an innocuous  change in language of the Adoption Act  transforms the possibilities for lesbians and  gay men who want to adopt a child as a  same-sex couple. The legislation used to say  that any single adult or married couple  could adopt. It now says "any person, or  any two people, may adopt." Common law  couples and lesbian or gay partners can  now adopt a child together. This most frequently arises when a child is born to one  of the couple and they want both the child's  same-sex parents to be recognized as parents in the eyes of the law. Under the old  law, if the biological mother permitted the  non-biological mother to adopt her child,  she would have to give up her parental  rights. But no more.  This is great news. But even the NDP,  the party of popular principles, hid this one  under a basket-it does not want to be seen  to be supporting lesbian and gay families  in this way. They are ashamed of us, or at  least afraid of what damage could be done  to them by their association with us, especially during an election campaign.  Don't get me wrong. I will take meaningful legislation brought into force quietly  over meaningless legislation enacted to  great fanfare any day.  So where do these developments leave  us? What now are the priorities for lesbians, for bisexual people, for gay men?  First of all, we must recognize that  none of the amendments, in either jurisdiction, affects the lives and the discrimination faced by transgendered women and  men, and we must lobby and organize for  their inclusion.  For lesbians, bisexual people and gay  men, the BC Adoption Act changes provide  a "short cut" to protections for our children  and our partners. We can give our children  rights to inheritance from both their parents; rights to maintenance from the noncustodial parent if their parents ever break  up; rights to access to the non-biological  parent; rights to have each parent able to  speak to the school, the doctor, the summer camp, the hospital, the passport office  about what is best for our children. We can  have families where the co-parents are truly  equal in the eyes of the law, where the children have a right to equal support from  each parent.  The Lesbian and Gay Rights Section of  the BC Branch of the Canadian Bar Association has asked the Legal Services Society to provide legal aid coverage for poor  lesbian and gay couples who want to initiate a step-parent adoption, arguing that  because this is the only way to protect our  families, legal aid should be granted. A  decision is forthcoming.  For lesbian and gay partners who do,  or do not, have children, there are many  battles to be fought in the provincial and  federal spheres to entrench recognition of  our families as legitimate. We must fight  those battles not on the basis that because  we are "just like heterosexuals" we should  get the "same" rights, but rather on the basis that we are one of many family forms  which Canadian law should recognize. We  don't want to squeeze our lives into their  definition while pulling the gate closed  behind us to exclude other family forms.  The existence of protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is an enormous help in those fights.  And as always our tight will be fought  simultaneously in courts of law, in legislatures, and in the court of public opinion.  Unless we move ahead synchronously on  all three fronts, we will ultimately lose our  way.  barbara findlay is a lesbian lawyer in Vancouver, co-chair of the Lesbian and Gay Rights  Section of the BC Chapter of the Canadian Bar  Association, and a member of the December 9  Coalition.  14  JUNE 1996 Arts  Popular education training guide and video:  Tools to tap  our potential  The Power Flower  by Sandra McPherson  COUNTING OUR VICTORIES:  Popular Education and  Organizing Training Guide  written by Denise Nadeau  COUNTING OUR VICTORIES:  Popular Education and  Organizing Video  written and directed by Dorothy Kidd  Both produced by Repeal the Deal Productions: Media Resources for Mobilization,  New Westminster, BC, January, 1996.  Counting Our Victories: Popular  Education and Organizing is a kit composed of two parts: a training guide and  video. The training guide is laid out as modules and offers educators and facilitators a  range of popular education methods, tools  and resources. The video has facilitators from  Canada, Nicaragua and Guatemala discussing popular education and follows two  groups of women activists in British Columbia, providing examples of approaches to the  popular education process.  It has been my experience, all too often, that in facilitated meetings for community or professional organizations I've  been involved with—Black, women's,  union—it has been required that I, in  some way, deny part of who I am. In those  situations where I feel that my whole  self—my race, class, education, sexual  orientation, et cetera—is not being respected, I withdraw and eventually drop  out of the groups.  I lay these feelings of frustration  squarely at the feet of the facilitator. If who  I am is not fully acknowledged, I do not  feel confident that what I want or need  can be fully understood or realized. I believe it is vital that facilitators, organizers  and activists from all shades, colours,  sexual and gender constructions, class  backgrounds and educational experiences do the work to culturally, historically and socially understand themselves  first.  As a Black feminist adult educator,  one of the most satisfying aspects of  Counting our Victories are its anti-racist,  feminist components. "Sometimes people  will resist 'race' saying it is a classification that divides people. You can acknowledge that race is a social construction. But all will agree that racism exists—  and without talking about 'race,' we can't  challenge it and are therefore supporting  the status quo." (A quote from the Doris  Marshall Institute, cited in the training  guide.)  Popular education holds that taking  a holistic approach to understanding oneself and the community's concerns is the  basis of learning and building strategies  for change. "The way to educate and organize is to first uncover and value that  knowledge and experience, then help  people collectively analyze what they  know and, if necessary, add new informa  tion, theory, and skills so they can move  on to apply their new understandings and  skills in action," writes Denise Nadeau  [see spiral graph.]  "Popular education is an approach  that critically examines and learns from  the lessons of past struggles, and from  concrete everyday situations in the  present. It is a deeply democratic process, equipping communities to themselves name and create the vision of the  alternatives they are struggling for,"  Nadeau writes in the introduction of the  training guide.  A fundamental of popular education  is that it respects the prior knowledge and  experiences of the people who are wanting to effect change—social, political and  economic change—in their lives, communities and countries. The popular education facilitator's skill is in enabling a community to consciously and critically reflect, recognize, organize and take action  for solutions to inequities that directly  affect the lives of those in the community.  Apply in Action  spiral graph  Counting Our Victories was developed as a training and resource guide for  educators, facilitators, activists and organizers. Says Dorothy Kidd: "I think it will  appeal to people who have already  thought about organizing and the importance of organizing. It's not a popular  document in the sense that anybody on  the street could read it."  "Popular education exists on many  continents," says Nadeau. "It's based on  a Marxist analysis of capitalism that, in  my opinion, is lacking in adult education  in Canada. We're really talking about a  political framework that takes class and  underclass very seriously."  While popular education has its roots  in liberation movements in South and  Central America, where the majority are  oppressed and marginalized, there is a  long and continuing history of popular  education in Canada. The Antigonish  Movement in the Atlantic provinces in the  1930s, where study circles were central to  the organizing of farmer and fishing coops, was a historical antecedent to popular education.  Counting Our Victories draws on the  experiences of women's groups and anti-  poverty groups, and groups doing international work around labour rights  in the last five years in Canada. "This  package is based on concrete work and education experiences of several groups in  Canada," says Dorothy Kidd.  Nadeau adds that being able to  draw from the experiences and  knowledge of others enabled the kit to  become as inclusive as it is. "With the critical feedback, input from so many people  from across the country, the product became this amazing evolution. To me it's  witness to what can be done collectively  here in Canada."  The participatory educational components of the training guide are laid out  in modules. At the beginning of each  module Nadeau provides a context, definitions and explanations of the overall  objective linking the modules to the  video, where it is applicable, and to what  has been learned in the previous modules  in a cohesive manner.  Each objective is clearly laid out with  graphics, some bold print and inspirational quotes from popular educators,  poets and songwriters. For every objective, facilitators are told what they will  need, how to accomplish the objective,  and the amount of time it may take to  achieve it.  Facilitators, organizers, activists and  educators are always encouraged to adapt  each objective to best suit their community's needs. There are references given  throughout the guide and additional references in the appendices to the guide for  those interested in learning more.  Nadeau and Kidd worked together  to integrate the guide and video. In an example of this integration shown in Module Five—"Culture, History, and Resistance"—the objective was to 'Examine the  production of cultural work in your own  community.' A section of the video shows  a facilitator leading a group of facilitator  training participants through a drumming activity.  Those watching the video are encouraged to discuss the drumming experience  they've seen using a set of questions put  forward in the guide: "What was the  value of the drumming activity to this  group of people? Why, or why would you  not, use this kind of activity? What kind  of cultural work is produced in your community? Describe the role and impact of  cultural work in your community. How  is it linked or can it be linked to organizing?"  The answers generated from the  viewing and the questioning are designed  to empower participants as they reclaim  their culture and history and regain a  sense of self and authority, which is necessary in movements for change. (Reflecting on the meaning of this exercise made  me think of Caribana [a annual Caribbean  Carnival] in Toronto. During Caribana I'm  bursting with pride and energy. No one  can tell me what "we" can't do during  Caribana.)  Both graphics from the Counting Our  Victories training guide.  The real value of this Training Guide  as a educational tool is that if it is used to  its fullest potential—if facilitators actually  do the work, such as: sharing histories  and dreams, examining personal organizing practices, and examining the form  and content of language (these are just  three of the 11 modules in the guide)—  then f acilitators of community and union  meetings will have participants who feel  respected and encouraged to do the hard,  time-consuming, personal work that is  needed in order to work towards social  change.  Kidd does acknowledge that Counting Our Victories may not worki for  every group, in every community, because of the evolving nature of our cultures. "In terms of popular education,  every five years, the social movements  that are organizing reveal new strategies.  I think that some of the places now that  we need to learn from as educators and  organizers are younger women and that  may not be reflected in the video or in the  guide," says Kidd.  Nadeau says Counting Our Victories  has already garnered interest from union  educators, educators who do international solidarity work which often involves issues around the economy and  making links between north and south,  as well as from groups such as a worker  education centre in New York that works  with undocumented Latino workers, the  Third World Education Centre in San  Francisco, the Centre for Continuing Education in South Africa, the Highlander  Centre in Tennessee that has been training union organizers and civil rights  workers and cultural workers in the  South since the 1930s, and the Hispanic  Centre here in Vancouver.  The video and guide may he purchased  by individuals as a kit for $35, or separately:  $25 for the video, $15 for the training guide.  For unions, institutions and organizations,  the kit is $50, or $35 for the video and $20  for the guide. (Plus 7% GST and 15% shipping and handling; US orders add 20%.)

JUNE 1996 Movement Matters  continued from page 8  Richmond Women's  Centre celebrates  20th anniversary  On July 26, the Richmond Women's  Centre will celebrate its 20th anniversary.  From its humble beginnings in 1976, the  centre has grown and flourished, and has  continuously expanded the range of its programs and services for the women in Richmond, BC.  During the course of the year, the Centre will be holding a number of events to  celebrate the accomplishments of the past  20 years. Social events, public education  evenings, guest speakers, workshops and  much, much more is planned.  The kick-off for the anniversary celebrations will be held on Saturday, July  27th, at 5:00 pm at The Caring Place, Room  340, 7000 Minoru Blvd, Richmond. It will,  be an evening of live entertainment by  women performers, a keynote address by  a well-known feminist, and lots of celebrating, reminiscing and fun for everyone.  For information about the events, and  about the Centre's programs and services,  contact The Richmond Women's Centre at  (604)279-7060.  Okanagan lesbian and  gay pride day  Lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and their  friends and families in the Okanagan region will be celebrating Lesbian and Gay  Pride Day on June 30—the first ever Pride  March in Okanagan history. They have requested that the mayor of Kelowna issue  an official declaration of the day, and they  expect to receive official recognition from  the city.  The Pride March will leave Kelowna's  City Park by the sails at 11:00am sharp and  will go along several downtown streets  before returning to the park. Following the  march, there will be a celebration at Kinsmen Park with entertainment, speakers and  games.  An event such as this is long overdue  in the Okanagan, say Okanagan Lesbian &  Gay Pride Day Committee members. There  are today a number of organizations in the  Okanagan for lesbians and gay men, their  friends and families. The oldest of these is  the Okanagan Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual  Organization, and the past year has seen  the growth of others such as a Kelowna  chapter of Parents, Friends and Family of  Lesbians and Gays, the Association for Social Knowledge (at Okanagan University  College), and the North Okanagan Gay  Organization in Vernon.  The march is expected to draw supporters from Vancouver, Alberta and Washington State in addition to those from the  B.C. Interior. A souvenir booklet is being  produced to commemorate the event.  For information contact Sharon Dale  Stone at (604) 766-2869.  Walk In, Speak Out on  Co-op Radio  In July, Vancouver's Co-operative Radio Station, CFRO 102.7FM, will be launching an eight-month project, Walk In Speak  Out, as part of its effort to expand its membership base and to carry on its tradition of  progressive broadcasting.  Co-op Radio has always been a community based radio station, produced by  and for the people of the BC Lower Mainland. However, barriers still exist which  make community programming inaccessible to some people. Walk In Speak Out will  bring together members of Vancouver's  diverse communities through a pro-active  recruitment and publicity campaign, during which Co-op's staff will make presentations to community groups in and out of  the station.  The campaign will target groups which  have been traditionally under-represented  on Vancouver's air waves, as well as on Coop's air waves—including poor women,  First Nations women, immigrant women,  sex-trade workers, transgendered people,  queer youth, and elders.  Once satisfactory recruitment numbers  have been achieved, new volunteers will  be trained in all aspects of radio programming including sound engineering, broadcasting, journalism and research.  Some new recruits will be channelled  into existing shows and others will be used  to create three new third-language radio  shows.  Co-op Radio hopes that Walk In Speak  Out will provide the station with new energy, while at the same time providing  grass-roots educational material to stimulate the general public into a more broad-  based dialogue.  To kick off the campaign, Co-op Radio  is having an "Across the Culture Information Blitz" open house on Friday July 5th,  from 5-9pm at the station, 337 Carrall St.  For more information call April or Centime at (604) 684-8494, Monday to Thursday between 12-6pm.  Cuban women  shaping the present  A group of Cuban women is building  an organization called MAGIN: Association of Women Communicators. Formed at  the first Latin American Meeting of Women  in Communication held in Cuba in February 1993, they include radio and TV journalists, TV film and video makers, writers,  researchers, psychologists, sociologists,  academics and theatre workers, all of  whom are also members of the Cuban Federation of Women. Their brochure describes  MAGIN as "the creative union of intelligence, imagination and image, very closely  related with our occupation as communicators" and our capacities as women.  Their goals are both creative and self-  supportive. They aim to produce media  that looks at the role of gender in Cuba and  shows others the importance of the Cuban  experience, as well as encouraging each  other's professional development, self-esteem and strength as women. Last summer,  Vancouverite Marilou Castillo (of Amigos  de Cuba) worked with the group to facilitate a series of sessions with marginalized  women in Atares, a poor neighbourhood  of Havana, which was called "Intuition and  Sensitivity: Ways of Communications."  In the last three years , the Cuban  women have hosted several other workshops, published a regular newsletter, and  begun to build a network of Cuban women  media-makers so that they can get their  own messages of their realities and aspirations out to media networks in Latin  America and elsewhere.  Their latest production is a video documentary of the life of Maria de los Reyes  Castillo Bueno. The 95 year old Reyita,  granddaughter of a slave and mother of  eight children, is a self-taught teacher and  an exceptional storyteller. The video  presents her telling passionate stories other  life, while providing a rare historical account of Cuban history.  MAGIN is looking for Canadian and  other international support to complete the  57 minute documentary of Reyita's life. Because of the US blockade of Cuba, it is difficult to send money there, so they ask you  to contact Mirta Rodriguez Calderon,  Sonnia Moro or Pilar Sa by telephone to  make arrangements—tel: (537)30-2034 or  (537)81-7837.  For more information about MAGIN,  contact them directly by e-mail:  magin@tinored.cu; by fax: (537)33-6288; or  by writing MAGIN, Calle Jesquina a 25,  Vedado, La Habana, Cuba, or Calle 8 No. 11,  Apt. 4, Entre Calzada y 5ta, Vedado.  Community  Development Institute  in Nelson  The second annual Community Development Institute (CDI) will take place this  summer in Nelson, B.C. from July 28 to  August 2 at the Canadian International  College. The event will feature over 75 different workshops and a wide range of activities. Workshops will focus on topics  such as women's labour rights, co-op development for women and consensus decision-making, and will highlight initiatives  such as the Downtown Women's Project in  Victoria.  Community development involves  people taking democratic control by participating in planning, bottom-up decisionmaking and community action. To facilitate this process the CDI will feature a variety of teaching and learning techniques  to build on the abilities and experiences of  participants. Many courses will highlight  examples of successful community initiatives from around BC, and there will be opportunities to visit community projects in  Nelson.  There will also be plenty of opportunities for informal learning, networking  and celebrating. "People working on all  aspects of community development have  indicated a real need to share information,  skills and ideas. The Institute will address  this need by creating opportunities for participants to come together to exchange strategies, ideas, successes and frustrations",  says Leslie Kemp, coordinator of the CDI.  The Institute is being developed by the  Social Planning and Research Council of BC  (SPARC), UBC Continuing Studies and  United Native Nations, in collaboration  with the West Kootenay Women's Association, Nelson District Women's Centre, Nelson Community Services Centre, Nelson  District Community Resources Society,  SHRED/Garage Youth Centre, and the  Kootenay Conference on Forest Alternatives.

Research on  lesbian abuse  Janice Ristock, coordinator and associate professor of women's studies at the  University of Manitoba, is conducting an  interview research project on abuse in lesbian relationships. Ristock has been researching lesbian abuse for the last four  years. She is also a member of CLOSE (the  Coalition of Lesbians on Support and Education.)  Ristock is currently looking for women  who have either been abused in a lesbian  relationship, or know someone who has  been abused in a lesbian relationship, to talk  about their/her experiences. All calls will  be kept confidential and messages can be  safely left on the answering machine. Long  distance calls will be returned. Interviewing will end in June 1998.  Ristock says the interview research she  is conducting is intended to assist lesbian  communities and service providers in further understanding, and ending this form  of abuse.  To participate in the research project,  call Janice Ristock at (204) 474-9108.  Support Kinesis, the only  feminist newspaper still  publishing in Canada!
