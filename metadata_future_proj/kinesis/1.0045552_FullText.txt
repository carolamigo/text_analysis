Kinesis      May 1982  INTERNATIONAL  Mothers an active, respected force in Nicaraguan society  by Heather Conn  A statue stands near the main square of a  small southern Nicaraguan town. It is of  a young woman who sits with head bent and  legs outstretched, her face closed in a  smile. The plaque beneath it reads: "In  love of the Nicaraguan mother".  In this Central American country, motherhood is a sacred institution. Like the  framed pictures of Christ and war martyrs  found in every home, a mother is the subject of respect and admiration. She provides comfort and support for her children. She is a strong, focal family member who heads 60 per cent of the nation's  households.  As hosts, Nicaraguan mothers are warm,  generous and hospitable. Whether in the  comfortable home of a city doctor or an  isolated peasant hut, they never, hesitate  to offer visitors a meal, sew a stranger's  torn jeans or invite you to stay the night.  Their welcoming "Esta su casa" (This is  your house) is meant in all sincerity'—  what is theirs is yours.  Women fettered by 'duty' to family  Yet despite the graciousness of their role, s  these women face many real obstacles that >,  prevent their emancipation from mother- g  hood.

Religion and its strong moral code provide  rigid rules for acceptable behaviour;  while men are free to flirt and carouse,  obedience and fidelity to a husband are  unwritten laws. As one poster reads:  "A woman who neglects her children for a  lover does not deserve the name of mother."  In most cases, fathers are the dominant  authority figures of the family. In one  small town, a public notice about changes  Amidst a strong family  atmosphere, mothers emerge as  efficient, hard-working,     **  aggressive people  in school hours is addressed only to "the  father of the family". A mother's control  of her children is not officially recognized.  And despite a mother's role as primary  'nurturer, she receives little help from  men in domestic duties. Few fathers are  found in the kitchen helping with the  preparation and serving of meals.  Instead, they are seen taking children  for walks, horseback rides or cradling  them to sleep. One public administrator  in Managua estimates that only about five  per cent of households have shared domestic duties within the home.  Laws support women and families  The evening newspaper in Nicaragua features a daily cartoon of a mother and her  child.  It explains the correct duties  of each parent according to their sex  role: a man is to protect his wife, while  a woman should pour her love into her  children.  Both are seen as active participants in  rearing their family, but each one's  function is separate and sex-defined.  Hence, what is written in the Statute on  the Rights of Nicaraguans is false:  "In  family relations there exists absolute  equality of rights and responsibilities  between man and woman."  However, there is one written law that  does hold weight and assures that mothers  are not left to support their children  alone. This is the new family law, guaranteeing a father's financial support of  children up to the age of seven.  When the child reaches seven, the family  can collectively visit a lawyer and, with  the child's consent, seek adoption or  choose one parent as sole supporter.  Whatever is decided, the child has equal  say on choosing his or her future. As  one Managuan woman declared, "I think in  a Latin American country such as Nicaragua is, this is an historical advantage."  The general welfare of the family is  always a concern in Nicaragua.  If a man  or woman is sent to jail, the pay that  either one receives for prison work is  sent back to the family. This ensures  that children still receive financial  support, despite the temporary loss of a  parent.  Responsibility for children shared  Throughout the country, microcosms of the  family are found, particularly on transportation vehicles.  On a bus, a person  sitting next to a mother holds her child  for her. On a boat, a visitor offers  "food to children lying next to her. People  share collectively in the care of children  — a stranger often comforts a baby while  a mother changes diapers.  People lend  parents blankets or a shoulder to lean on  if a trip is long or uncomfortable.  In "barrios" or district neighbourhoods,  many people in their twenties still live  happily at home. Children of many different families walk freely among each other's'  homes, treated like kin by adults.  There  is nonsense of exclusivity or ..private  sanctity of the family; homes are open to  all.  Amidst this strong family atmosphere,  mothers emerge as efficient, hard-working,  aggressive people. They are an active  force in Nicaragua — a national committee  of mothers of war heroes and martyrs exists to do internal solidarity work. These  women hold protests and functions to commemorate the war victory and to promote »,  revolutionary spirit.  %  It is no surprise that every May 30 in  Nicaragua, parties are held to celebrate  Mother's Day. The Nicaraguan mother  deserves to be honoured — hers is a 24-  hour occupation.  radical  reviewer  Canada's only radical/feminist book  review and literary tabloid.

Hospital scoreboard — an abortion update  by Melinda Suto and Marva Blackmore  The following article is reprinted from  the April 1982 newsletter of the Concerned  Citizens for Choice on Abortion.     CCCA may  be contacted by writing P.O. Box 24617,  Station C,  Vancouver, B.C.   V5T 4E1 or by  phoning 876-9920.     CCCA newsletter subscriptions are $S/year.  Anti-abortionists have frequently chosen  hospital board elections as their battleground to deny women choice on abortion.  Each board may decide to appoint a Therapeutic Abortion Committee (TAC), which  has the power to decide whether a woman  can have an abortion.  If a particular hospital board decides not  to appoint a TAC, the consequences for  women in that area are serious, especially  if she is many miles from the closest hospital with a TAC, a situation not uncommon in B.C.  The accompanying update on the "Hospital  Scoreboard (oringially published in December 1981 CCCA Newsletter), was done to  provide women with accurate information  regarding the availability of abortion in  B.C. hospitals. Eighty-seven questionnaires were sent to hospitals that were  likely to have medical-surgical facilities,  and thirty-six replies were received.  What is happening on the B.C. hospital  scene?  SURREY  At Surrey Memorial Hospital in June of  1981, the Therapeutic Abortion Committee  was disbanded by its anti-abortion dominated hospital board. This meant that no  therapeutic abortions could be performed  at that hospital for any reason.  As a result, physicians refused to participate on the other administrative committees of the hospital, stating that their  ability to provide medical service and to  exercise sound medical judgement was being  seriously curtailed.  B.C.'s Minister of Health, Jim Neilsen,  appointed an administrator to mediate  between the hospital board and the doctors.  The hospital board election was cancelled  and the TAC would not be reinstated until  a compromise had been reached.  On February 5, 1982, a compromise was  reached and the TAC was reinstated. However, restrictive guidelines have been  placed on when and for what reasons abortions may be performed.  CCCA obtained this information from a doctor on staff at Surrey Memorial:  * No abortions will be performed after 20  weeks gestation.  * Abortions can be performed if the mental  or physical health of the woman is endangered. The doctor must provide documentation regarding signs and symptoms of health  risks. The TAC is instructed to interpret  Section 251 of the Criminal Code - especially the definition of health - in a conservative manner.  * Abortions will be performed in the case  of rape or incest.  * Women seeking repeat abortions must be  seen by a minister, chaplain or social  worker.  * Abortion alternative counselling is compulsory and may be done by the woman's  physician.

The events  leading up to this action were related to  CCCA by a member of CARAL (Canadian Abortion Rights Action League) in Victoria.  The three-member medical executive committee proposed a set of guidelines to be  followed by the TAC when approving abortion requests. These guidelines were then  taken to three medical staff meetings for  approval. The guidelines were rejected at  the Family Physicians staff meeting, at  the meeting of the Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as at a General Staff  meeting.  At the February meeting of the hospital  board it was decided that because 100% of  the doctors had not been present at these  staff meetings a mail-out referendum would  be conducted in March. Until the vote was  completed, though, the TAC would be disbanded.  Some of the proposed guidelines are:  #Women seeking first trimester abortions  can be no more than 11 weeks pregnant at  the time of application.  * Women seeking second trimester abortions  can be no more than 18 weeks pregnant at  the time of application.  * Women seeking abortions must be seen by  two doctors and both opinions must be submitted to the TAC. The second opinion must  be a lengthy, narrative style justification  of the need for the abortion.  * No woman may obtain an abortion for what  the board deems to be minor reasons, such  as emotional or financial distress.  * The woman must be informed as to the  "long-term physical and emotional effects"  of having an abortion. (No mention is made  of informing her that carrying a pregnancy  to term is 10 times more dangerous than  having a first trimester abortion. Nor has  any reference been made to recent studies  done in Vancouver that for many women the  effects of a first trimester abortion are  far less devastating than having an unwanted pregnancy or surrendering a child  at birth for adoption - an option most  married couples would not even consider.)  A late note:  Doctors at Victoria General  turned down the guidelines proposed in the  mailout referendum. As a result, the Therapeutic Abortion Committee has been terminated by the hospital board. No more abortions may be performed.  RICHMOND  After a series of secret meetings at Richmond General Hospital between the anti-  abortion dominated board and members of  the medical staff of RGH, an 8-point set  of guidelines for the TAC was presented  on March 5, 1982.  According to a report in the Richmond  Review,  under the terms of the new guidelines, abortions will only be performed  under the following conditions:  continued on page 6 4       Kinesis       May 1982  ACROSS CANADA  Four-woman team to scale Alaska's Mt. McKinley  Four experienced women mountaineers are  planning to climb 20,300' Mt. McKinley in  Alaska this May. The highest peak in North  America, Mt. McKinley has been called "the  coldest mountain on earth", with temperatures far below zero and frequent winds to  100 mph.  The climbers will start their ski-in to  the mountain from Kahiltna Glacier in Mt.  McKinley Park, Alaska. They are allowing  one month for the climb.  The climbing team will consist of: leader  Jan St. Amand, a first aid attendant and  kinesiology student at Simon Fraser University; Elaine Kennedy, M.D., who has  high altitude experience climbing in South  America; Jane Weller, a worker at Mountain  Equipment Co-op who has climbed Mt. Logan  and several Yukon peaks; and Barb Clemis,  an Outward Bound instructor and physiotherapist .  The women are selling expedition t-shirts  which read "Women on Denali" "Mt. McKinley".  If you want information about the climb,  or would like to support the climb by buying a t-shirt, call Jan St. Amand at 873-  9409.  Indian woman faces  deportation, social rejection  Amarjit Kaur Sandhu, a woman whose husband  left her in India, then refused to sponsor  her as an immigrant to Canada when she  came looking for him is facing deportation  this month.  In the face of rejection by her husband  after she arrived in Canada on a temporary  visitor's permit, Amarjit initiated maintenance, then divorce proceedings in family court. Immigration authorities extended her visitor's permit to May 28 to allow  her case to go to court, but now they say  she must go back to India.  It is crucial that Amarjit be granted permanent status and the opportunity to make  a new life for herself in Canada, for if  she is forced to return to India deserted  and alone, she will be a social outcast.  Suicide or a life of prostitution may be  the only alternatives for her.  In the little time left, all concerned  individuals and organizations are requested  to write letters supporting permanent  status for Amarjit to: The Minister of  Immigration, Lloyd Axworthy (c/o Parliament  Buildings, Ottawa). Copies of letters  should be sent to Amarjit's lawyer Calvin  Sandborn at Matsqui/Abbotsford Community  Legal Services, 2406 Montrose St., Abbots-  ford, B.C.  Women counted in the  legislature  Here are the latest figures on women in  provincial government:  The Northwest Territories has the largest  percentage of elected women, with 20% of  the seats held by women. The November  election in Manitoba brought 7 women to  the legislature for a total of 12.3% of  the seats.  In Alberta, six seats are held by women.  Quebec women hold seven of 122 seats. In  B.C. 6 of 57 seats are held by women; in  Ontario, 6 of 125; in New Brunswick, 4 of  58; in P.E.I., 2 of 32;-and in Newfoundland, 2 of 52 seats.  Both Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia have one  woman sitting in the legislature. Nova  Scotia's Alexa McDonough is also the only  woman party leader (NDP).  (Status of Women News)  Nearly half of female-headed  families are poor  The National Council of Welfare recently  published a report based on the preliminary findings of the 1980 federal survey  on income distribution in Canada.  The figures would be startling were they  not a repeat of the same old story. According to the report, in 1980 10.4% of  Canadian families lived in poverty. For  single people, the risk of poverty was  three times as great - 31.4% of all single  Canadians were poor in 1980.  Female-headed families remain highly vulnerable to poverty - 41.5% of these families live below the poverty line, the  risk of poverty being six times greater  for women than for men.  For single women, the degree of poverty  compared to men was not so great, but the  difference is still a telling one. 38.1%  of single women were poor in 1980, compared to 22.9% of men. Women make up 67.8%  of all single people in Canada.  The average income of single men in 1980  was $16,659 compared to single women's  average income of $8,101. Households headed by men had an average income of $25,464  than double the $10,860  of female-headed family  From these figures, it is not surprising  that income distribution overall remains  a highly unequal proposition. In 1980, the  poorest 20% of Canadian families had only  5.9% of all family income. Among single  people, the top fifth claimed 45.5% of  total income - eleven times the poorest  group's share.  Battered women face court  order delays  A recent decision by the Supreme Court of  Canada may force battered women to wait  eight to ten weeks to obtain legal protection from men who have assaulted them in  the home.  The decision means that provincial family  judges can no longer enforce restraining  orders on men who have assaulted women in  the home. Restraining orders, which bar  a man from the family home, could formerly  be obtained within five days with the help  of a community worker, but now they must  be obtained through county or supreme  court. Due to heavy case back-log, a woman can be left waiting up to eight weeks,  forcing her to flee the home indefinitely  while the man remains.  The greater complexity of these courts  also necessitates the advice of a lawyer.  Moderate income women will be the most  affected financially, since they don't  qualify for legal aid and may not have  access to money controlled by their husbands .  A petition presented by the Committee for  Justice for Assaulted Women at International Women's Day this year outlines the following proposals:  - that courts be encouraged to have dually-  appointed judges (who maintain both federal and provincial jurisdictions) to  alleviate the current back-log of cases;  - that unified courts exist province-wide,  meaning that federal and provincial courts  should merge when dealing with family  issues;  - that legislation be passed to make  restraining orders "effectively enforceable" .

(Toronto Clarion)  Librarians lose back pay on  technicality  The union which" won in collective bargaining salary increases giving 52 female  National Research Council librarians  parity with male federal historical researchers has lost out in a recent try to  win back pay for the 52.  The Canadian Human Rights Comission ruled  it could not grant the back pay request  as it had earlier in a similar ruling  affecting Treasury Board researchers, because the two groups work for different  employers.  The union, the Professional Institute of  the Public Service, had contended that the  Treasury Board and the Research Council  are separate government employers in name  only, and that the same discrimination  found in one case applied to the other.  The union said the ruling was unfair because it was based on a technicality.  (SWAG News, Victoria) May 1982      Kinesis  INTERNATIONAL  Chinese feminists jailed for  " sedition''  In Taiwan the struggle for. human rights is  fraught with bitter irony. Although Dec.  10 is Human Rights Day internationally, it  was during a supportive rally in Kaohsiung,  Taiwan that violence erupted and more than  200 people were arrested.  Eight of them, including two noted feminist  leaders, were tried for "sedition" by a  military tribunal, convicted and sentenced  to from 12 years to life in prison. All  eight were associated with the anti military/government magazine Formosa    which  had sponsored the demonstration.  The feminists are Lu Hsiu-lien, 37, an  editor of Formosa  and an activist in women 's rights for over a decade, and Chen  Chu, 31, deputy director of the magazine's  Kaohsiung office.  All trial defendants claimed 'confessions'  had been illegally extracted from them  during a two-month intensive interrogation.  They were beaten, denied sleep, psychologically pressured and Lu was threatened  with execution and family members' arrests.  Following Lu's arrest Yeh Tao-lei, a  sociologist, attempted to continue her  organizing. She founded a lifeline crisis  clinic and a women's aid centre in Kaohsiung. She was arrested, also charged with  'sedition', and sentenced to 14 years.  Amnesty International has adopted the  cases of Lu and Chen, and is considering  that of Yeh. To protest these arrests,  write President Chiang Ching-Kuo, Chieh  Shou Hall, Chungking S. Rd, Taipei,  Taiwan, Republic of China. (Broadsheet)  Nestle boycott continues despite  proposed marketing reforms  According to the Infant Formula Action  Coalition (INFACT Canada) the international boycott of Nestle corporation continues despite the firm's March 16 compliance with the World Health Organization's restrictions for third world marketing of infant formulas.  The capitulation came only days after  Nestle suffered serious public relation  defeats. A Nestle poll in Toronto indicated growing issue awareness and boycott  support with 10% of the populace, some  250,000 people, actively abiding by it.  Nestle was also unable to defeat a student  boycott referendum at Notre Dame School.  The American Public Health Association  then voted unanimously to join the International Nestle Boycott Committee and its  negotiation team.  The boycott, in effect five years, has  attempted to pressure Nestle (controllers of one third of the worldwide infant  formula market) to change their agressive  marketing practices. Health officials believe such tactics have contributed to the  malnutrition, disease and death of millions of infants.  Although infant formula is potentially  life sustaining, the contamination of  water, poverty and illiteracy prevalent  in third world nations combines lethally  with advertising which discourages breast  feeding in favour of breast milk substitutes.  Rafael Pagan, president of the Nestle Coordination Centre for Nutrition, maintains  that Nestle will implement the WHO code  "on its own initiative where no measures  have been taken to apply (it)." It will  switch to non-promotional labelling and  will ban gift packages containing formula,  bottles or other baby accessories. Health  workers will receive supplies of formula  only upon request.  Spokespeople for the boycott express guarded optimism. David Hallman of INFACT notes  discrepancies between the WHO code and  Nestle's apparent interpretation of it.  Douglas Johnson, national chairperson of  INFACT, cautions that the announcement is  not to be regarded as a settlement but as  "the basis for a settlement." He recognizes  a need to establish negotiations with Nestle to agree upon procedures of code implementation and continuing monitoring of  Nestle compliance.  Although an invitation to begin talks has  been extended to the firm, Johnson stresses  that the boycott will not be lifted until  Nestle's commitment is confirmed with  action.  Sri Lanka women protest  physical violence  Women in Sri Lanka have had official equality and free education for more than 50  years, but working women have found that  participation in new fields of work has  subjected them to physical violence when  they engage in workplace struggles.  An article from Voice of Women  (a Sri Lankan feminist journal) gives examples of  women's participation in every progressive  struggle for trade union and political  rights since the beginning of the labour  movement in the 1920s.  Recently teachers and nurses, in separate  demonstrations over the rising cost of  living and for trade union rights, were  beaten, stoned, run over, covered with oil,  as well as verbally abused. The nurses  went on strike again to protest about  those attacks and Voice of Women  has  written to the President and to the newspapers to express their anger. (Outwrite)  (Voice of Women is available from 529  Bauddhaloka Mawatha,   Colombo-8 Sri Lanka.)  New York implements  state- wide on-site daycare  Those concerned with the stress caused to  women by dual roles as workers and mothers  are watching with great interest a new  venture in daycare by New York State and  public service unions.  In the first statewide set-up in the  country, the State of New York, acting as  employer, has agreed to co-operate with  employee unions in setting up 23 onsite  daycare centres in places such as hospitals, psychiatric centres, and offices.  The centres will care for children of  state employees while their parents are  at work. Employee unions and the state  will jointly supply the funds, with the  state providing the space. Planning and  administration will be carried out by  representatives of the state, unions, daycare specialists and parents.  The concept for these centres was written  into the Civil Services Employees Association 1972 union contract, but it did not  become effective until 1979 when funding  was released and a demonstration daycare  was set up in Albany.  Since then, 11 more centres have been  planned and are awaiting final state approval and funding. Each centre will  accommodate about 40 children. To receive  funding, organizing committees must consist of representatives from management,  labour and community organizations. They  must also complete a needs survey.  Fees at the model centre in Albany are on  a sliding scale according to income and  range from $42 to $58 per week per child,  which is lower than the average for existing facilities. The Empire State Day Care  Services Corporation, as the Albany centre  is known, sets fees and budget through its  Parents Advisory Committee.  The greatest demand at this centre appears  to be for infant care. There are currently  18 infants at the centre, with a waiting  list of 200 more. The centre has a breastfeeding program enabling mothers to come  in during the working day to feed their  infants. (W0HCR News)  ILO issues alert on carbonless  copy paper  The International Labor Organization has  issued a health hazard alert requesting  information about the effects of carbonless copy paper on eyes, mucous membranes  and skin.  The ILO reports that in Sweden office workers handling the paper have reported irritations of these parts of the body, although  patch tests with the paper and the chemicals used in it have not shown allergic  reactions. One trade union with 120,000  members received more than 1700 complaints  in response to an inquiry to its members  about the paper.  Last June, the Journal of the American  Medical Association  reported a case of allergic contact dermatitis in a clerk in a  college registrar's office who used carbonless copy forms. She developed the allergic  reaction only at the times of year when  large amounts of the paper were used for  student registration.  Earlier, University of Washington researchers had found that the paper can give off  enough formaldehyde fumes to seriously  irritate office workers' skin, eyes, noses  and throats.  The ILO alert asks for further information  which can be passed on to the Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and  Health. (W0HCR News) Kinesis      May 1982  CONFERENCES  Single mothers affirm common cause and support  by Ellie Burton  "Like the women's movement of the 70's  where women recognized a common cause and  found support in their newly discovered  solidarity—so single parents all over  British Columbia are bonding together."  These were Rosemary Brown's opening remarks at a Single Mothers' Conference held  recently in Surrey, and they reflect what  happened for many women at the conference.  Held on March 27, the conference brought  together 150' women, many of whom had never  been to a women's conference or a women's  group before. The day began quietly as  Rosemary Brown outlined just how bad the  situation for B.C. women is.  Rosemary Brown addressing conference  Among other things, she commented that:  women raising children on their own are  six times more likely to live in poverty  than men in the same situation; 63% of all  poor people in B.C. are women; and, despite  the fact that women make up 42% of the  province's labour force, they remain largely poor due to the continued exploitation  of their labour.  HOSPITAL SCOREBOARD continued from page 3  * Approval cannot be granted solely at the  request of the patient - in accordance  with the law.  * Women must be no more than 12 weeks pregnant at the date of application. The  abortion may not take place after 16  weeks gestation.  * Applications may be approved when any  factor is present which endangers the life,  physical health or mental health of the  patient. A physician's personal letter  must accompany the application explaining  why the pregnancy should be terminated.  * Patients under 16 must obtain parental  consent.  * Thorough counselling regarding alternatives to abortion is required. Contraceptive counselling is mandatory.  * Patients seeking a repeat abortion must  obtain a second written medical opinion.  * The TAC has the authority to request additional information or the supporting  documentation they consider necessary.  * The TAC will be appointed by the hospital board from a list of seven names submitted by the chief of staff.  Brown explained that single mothers often  lose money when they go out to work. This  is because income assistance is pegged to  how many children one has, while the minimum wage is a flat rate.  She disagrees with those who think the way  out of this problem is for women to work  in non-traditional fields. While she encourages women to do this kind of work if  it's their choice, she says it's time the  true skill and worth of service and clerical work was recognized, with wages reflecting this value. Equal pay, she insists,  is the route out of the poverty cycle for  women.  Brown said that of 760,000 children under  the age of six whose mothers are in the  labour force, only 12.6% are in approved  daycare. She ascribed this horrendous lack  of daycare to the "schizophrenic approach"  of the Socreds, which is: If women are  married, they should stay home and take  care of their kids. Once they're single  parents, however, they should go out to  work (and leave their kids anywhere they  can!).  Brown concluded by urging women to become  a part of the political process in order to  see changes made.  After her speech, we split up for a variety  of workshops.  In the groups, we shared  our stories, tightening in sadness and  anger as we recognized ourselves in each  other. We felt relief, too, that we weren't  alone.  Poverty creates desperate cycle  I spoke with women individually about their  2  financial situations. They described the  «  desperate cycles they were caught in.  S One woman said, "Welfare gives me $700 per  month for me and my two kids. I can't make  ends meet. I can't live on it. I get tired  of them telling me I should be on a budget.  Another woman said welfare gives her $800  for herself and her three children. She  pays $500 rent (can't find anything cheaper), $55 hydro, the phone and other bills,  and that leaves her $150 for all other expenses including food.  "As far as I'm concerned," she said, "if  you can't eat it, you don't buy it!" Although she was doing well in a college  program in Alberta, she was forced to drop  out when her childcare subsidy ended. She  came to B.C. only to find there are no  subsidies for school programs longer than  one year, and that the waiting list for  one year programs is 2 to 3 years long.  Meanwhile, the only jobs she is able to  get are jobs she literally can't afford to  take. With a job paying $1000 she would  lose her daycare subsidy, have the additional expenses of transportation and clothing needed for work and thus be worse  off financially than if she didn't work.  Also, if she went out to work, she would  have to put her children in an unlicensed  daycare or a family situation - both of  which are serious gambles to take in the  life of a child.  Regional support groups formed  "I'm trying to get off welfare. I've been  in an upgrading program for two years. Now  they tell me it may be cut out because of  educational cutbacks. So what do I do?  Either I give up entirely, or I have to  start from 'A' again, and I won't. I'll  fight. Nobody's going to stop me after  I've gone this far!"  Commenting on Rosemary Brown's statement  that single mothers should get politically  organized, this woman said, "It's all well  and good for her to tell us that, but I  don't have the time, I don't have the resources—I don't have the busfare!"  This last comment was fairly indicative of  where many women at this conference found  themselves. At the final plenary session,  the possibility of political organizing  was mentioned. While it was thoughtto be  a good thing, it seems many women are just  not at that point yet.  Women did respond strongly to the idea of  regional support groups. A number of such  groups were formed at the conference and  women eagerly signed up for them.  The conference overall was a success. It  helped break down the isolation single  mothers expereience and acted as a good  starting point for further involvement and  participation.  What does this all mean?  access and availability to abortion facilities steadily eroded. We can take heart  in the fact that although these hospital  boards are dominated by anti-abortionists  who want abortions ended totally, they  have not been able to achieve that goal.  We owe a great deal of thanks to the doctors at these hospitals who have carried  on the struggle within their own hospitals.  These battles are serving notice to anti-  abortionists that they cannot, with their  single-minded election campaigns, take over  hospital boards and force their minority  will on all of us.  However, the limited right to choose that  presently exists is becoming more limited  every day. The current law allows each  individual hospital (even those funded by  our tax dollars) to determine whether it  will provide abortion services for the  women in their area.  The consequences of these cutbacks are  devastating for many women. In Surrey,  most women are being referred to Vancouver  General Hospital where a liberal definition  bf health is used. Those who can afford  it are going to the United States to obtain  abortions.  During the past year in B.C. we have seen   According to one doctor in Victoria, there  has been an increase in women using noxious  substances and dangerous methods to bring  about their own abortions.  The number of  women there needing treatment for the  effects of illegal backstreet abortions is  also increasing.  If abortions are not available, women will  seek whatever means necessary to obtain  the service. The question is not whether  abortions exist but rather whether there  will be safe, legal abortions or dangerous  abortions.  The current laws leave hospital boards and  women vulnerable to attacks by a small  minority who seek to impose their moral  code on all people. We must continue to  demand that the government take a strong  stand and repeal all anti-abortion laws.  Once we have achieved this goal, we will  no longer be hampered when demanding that  provincial governments allocate funding  for all reproductive rights needs. We do  not only need access to safe, legal abortions but also to contraceptive counselling, sex education, and unbiased counselling when pregnancy occurs.  As long as the current law exists, attacks  will continue, and we may see access to  abortion services curtailed even further. May 1982      Kinesis  SOCIOBIOLOGY  Social equality not just a matter of natural selection  by Jan DeGrass  The trouble with Sarah Hrdy's arguments is  that they seem to cut both ways. She's a  scientist, and scientific data has a way  of turning up jokers just when it seems  like biology is on our side. But she's  also a feminist and her conclusions are  hopeful, powerful and optimistic for feminists.  Hrdy is a Harvard graduate, a primatologist  and sociobiologist. Her work has taken her  from the slopes of Mount Abu in western  India, where she studied the behaviour of  Hanuman langur monkeys, to the jungles of  Madagascar, where she listened to the howl  of the pro-simian Indri.  Specifically, she studies the behaviour of  female monkeys. An account of her findings  is contained in her recent book The Woman  That Never Evolved  (Harvard University  Press, 1981).  Theories subject to different  interpretations  Early March found her in Vancouver's Robson Square, lecturing to a somewhat somnolent lunch-hour crowd of homo sapiens.  And although her lecture ranged widely, her  comments clearly appealed to two opposing  segments of the audience—those people who  choose to view human behaviour as descending directly from our hairy ancestors, and  those who seek a way out of a potential  biological prison by believing that humans  are reasoning, evolved beings capable of  creating change.  One of those present at the Robson Square  lecture was Birute Galdikas, a visiting  professor at Simon Fraser University whose  studies take her regularly to Borneo to observe the solitary orangutan in its natural  state. There are not too many people who can  claim to have had a baby orangutan in a  Seattle zoo named after them, but Birute is  one of them.  Sarah Hrdy and Birute Galdikas share similar views. There is no doubt in their minds  that humans can change the human condition  without benefit of evolution. The fact that  they are called upon to discuss this issue  is a tribute to the dramatic impact of  sociobiology on our thinking.  Biological determinism affirms male  myths  A primatologist is one who studies primates—an order comprised of several hundred simian creatures including lemurs,  baboons, chimps, gorillas and humans.  A sociobiologist is a little more difficult to define. Sociobiologyl is a field  that applies biology, specifically natural  selection, in determining the direction  of primate behaviour. It hypothesizes the  results of a certain behaviour pattern,  assuming that behaviour is genetically determined.  Biologists who have applied the principle  of natural selection to primate behaviour  have hitherto been very satisfied with  the accuracy of their hypothesis.  Just how much of human behaviour is genetically determined and how much is not?  That humans walk bi-pedally, that we sleep  at night—these are genetically determined,  a result of our evolution. But what other  characteristics come from our genes?  Research indicates that in most primates  the male is the dominant sex. (Hrdy defines dominance as the ability to coerce  the behaviour of others.) Newer research  indicates that female primates in most  species are competitive with one another -  fighting over breeding privileges, over  feeding areas and to maintain their status  within the group.  I In 1975 Edmund Wilson put the name to a  body of knowledge that had been gathered  for some thirty years. His work, Sociobiology:  the New Synthesis,  was critically  dissected by feminists (see Broadside,  Dec/Jan 1981).  This image of the female primate as passive, complacent to male rule, bitching  at one another and furthermore, possibly  genetically-disposed in this direction,  is easily viewed by the chauvinistic male  in the most ill-favoured and fatalistic  light.  It gives Province  columnist Jon Ferry (the  macho man) the opportunity to say: "Biology, in short, has been one weapon that  the masculine man has used to keep the  feminist in her place. "  It has allowed anthropologists like Lionel  Tiger and popular science writer Desmond  Morris to affirm the myth of male superiority.  Past research reflected male bias  Interestingly, when Hrdy, a feminist, presents identical data we are forced to make  some different and more accurate conclusions .  Hrdy begins by noting that facts are facts:  "That sexes differ is simply true. Men  have more muscle mass and are generally  bigger. Women have more endurance and they  bear children." Nature is not nice—or  equal.  According to some theories, these differences have given rise to primitive man as  hunter, roaming freely, unencumbered by  infants, and ready for battle.  At the same time, primitive woman stayed  at home, presumably to tend the hearth,  live longer and feel constrained by the  thrall of childbirth. ("Sperm is cheap,  eggs come dear", summarizes Birute, who  is given to succinct statements.)  In the first chapter of her book, Hrdy  disposes of some of the worst examples of  this kind of erroneous thinking.  "The dominant male is obviously the central figure in the group's persistence over  time," says Lionel Tiger. They're not.  Hrdy's research shows females to be the  stabilizing force.  Tiger also states: "Women are biologically  programmed to not dominate political systems ."  Hrdy again dismisses such thinking as false  and states, "females are competitive,  assertive and...political".  One of the reasons this picture has taken  so long to emerge is that monkey-viewing  has generally been confined to studying  the male of the species, especially when  observation took place in the wild.  Hrdy points out that males are "more conspicuous, more boisterous, their fierce  display of aggressiveness captures the attention of the photographer. They were noticed and hence studied more frequently  than female behaviour."  Without dwelling on it, she also points  out that simians were generally studied  by male researchers whose biases and  interests mirrored the conventional power  structure of that time and of the organizations and universities that encouraged  the studies.  This has changed greatly in recent years.  With the advent of more women in the field,  the study of female behaviour has become  acceptable.  "Men studying baboons for example, twenty  years ago would have focused on the male  baboon. It's the same in medicine—twenty,  thirty years ago male doctors would not  have seen the importance of studying the  menstrual cycle. Now it is studied and  consequently we're seeing the results—it's  not all in our heads say the television  advertisements."  Birute feels women are generally more interested in studying the female condition,  and even if they weren't, the methodology  of the field has also improved vastly in  the last decade. It's become harder to ignore all aspects of studying a behaviour  problem and still produce acceptable, well-  documented research. And, of course, some  women like Jane Goodall have worked in the  field of female primate behaviour for  years.  Studies of female behaviour have turned up  the following:  1) Primate males are able to dominate females. Only exceptionally do females exercise direct control over male behaviour.  2) Female society among primates is more  stable than that of the male. In baboons,  for example, the males are transient and  their status changes within the various  groups. Female baboons remain in their own  group throughout their life and their hierarchy is stable and predictable.  3) Females are competitive. In most species  all child-bearing females jockey continuously for a place in the troop hierarchy  which allows them access to the dominant  male, and the prime position in feeding  grounds and watering holes. Thus, females  tend to compete for resources while males  compete for females.  Hamadryas baboons   &k  J a * %  These are general tenets, but in fact, behaviour varies widely from species to species. Two striking examples are the differences between hamadryas baboons and gelada.  Both species live in complex hierarchical  societies, the basic social or foraging  unit being a harem of females with usually  one male adult. The one male is typically  dominant and responsible for breeding, but  not the care of infants. Here the similarities end.  The female hamadryas leads a sheltered, oppressive existence. Lured from her parents  continued on page 8 8      Kinesis      May 1982  SOCIOBIOLOGY  EQUALITY VS. GENES continued from page 7  at a tender age, she is conditioned by her  male captor to unquestioning obedience and  is subject to nips, threatening stares, or  outright bites on the scruff of the neck.  In danger, his large body shelters her  smaller one. If she hesitates to follow him  she is chased and urged back into the fold.  This excessively paternalistic attitude on  the part of the male hamadryas ensures reproductive survival in a harsh environment,  the arid plateau of Ethiopia. The hamadryass  troop without a dominant male is a rudderless collection of females who can scarcely  tolerate one another and eventually disperse.  Female gelada baboons also congregate,  harem-like, around a dominant male, but  their kinship with one another is quite  different. The females are tightly knit,  often related, and their social organization remains unchanged by the coming and  goings of males.  Should a male choose to rush a female  gelada in the same manner as his hamadryas  cousin, he is immediately confronted by  her snarling and lunging "sisters" and may  find himself effecting a rapid retreat.  Superficially, the two species seem similar, with female harems organized around  a central male. Obviously, though, the  position of gelada males in the power  structure is considerably weaker than it  first appears.  Social behaviour always complex  Male responsibility for care of infants  varies widely between species. Males most  likely to invest time in infant care are  those who are reasonably sure of their  paternity by having a sustained, usually  monogamous relationship with the mother  (roughly 18% of primates) or a principal,  consort relationship.  There are exceptions. The barbary macaque,  a species characterized by a frenzied sex  life and promiscuity, "regularly interacts  with infants in a variety of caretaking  duties during the infants' first year of  life." Most males direct their attention  toward one or two specific infants, so  that each infant is cared for by several  different males.  The macaques are unusual in this. And as  if to illustrate how complex simian  social behaviour can be, this benevolent  paternal picture is shattered by observation of the violent, inadequately-explained behaviour of males in the wild—their  cruel savaging of infants who are not  their own.  When a male ape meets or attempts to hijack a group of females in the wild, his  first act will be to seize any unweaned  infant (almost certainly offspring of  previous rivals), kill and often cannibalize them.  In response, a female show of solidarity  similar to that of the geladas swings into  action. Several females, usually those  past childbearing age, rush at the bully  and may succeed in saving the child. The  mother of the unfortunate tyke is often  the least upset of anyone at this display  and she makes only feeble attempts to  protect her progeny.  4*?  Hrdy suggests an explanation to this  grotesque drama. First, she believes that  the trait towards infanticide in males is  genetically determined. Males, in attempting to ensure the reproductive success of  their own offspring, will destroy all  newborns of dubious parentage. The mother's actions appear to condone this behaviour rather than to stop it.  As soon as the new male is ensconced as  leader of the troop, and after the initial show of agression by some females,  they change their tune and respond to his  overtures. (Clearly a case of the king is  dead, long live the king. )  Within eight days after the death of her  infant, the bereaved mother is presenting  her pink bottom to the new male in coital  pay-off for what can only be called antisocial behaviour.  Rank brings stability, social rewards  "Why don't females vote with their genes?"  asks Hrdy. "Why don't they choose not to  mate with this infanticidal tyrant?" A  successful Lysistrata campaign could wipe  out this gene pool and ensure a higher  infant survival rate. The answer is, she  can't afford to.  She's in a highly competitive position  with the other females in the troop. It  would not be advantageous to her or her  future offspring to withhold sex; a monkey  not breeding is a monkey who will lose  points in the troop's social hierarchy.  Motherhood confers a number of important  social and practical rights on the female  monkey—and that status is worth striving  for.  Now you can really show your support for  Kinesis ...

As the high-ranking female she will copulate with the male frequently and during  her most fertile periods, thus assuring  her new infant's protection by the new  father. She will feed first, and the most  succulent morsels will be prepared in advance by her consort and protector. She  will be the first to drink at the watering hole. In harsh terrain, these privileges could save her life.  Finally, she will be groomed and attended  by her female kin and followers, many of  whom will be delighted to act as aunts to  any offspring.  Thus, benefits from high rank tend to' be  more rewarding and more worth fighting for  than the silly scrapes of males, and many  females will spend a lifetime striving for  them, thus providing a stability and organization to the monkey world that would  not be otherwise possible.  As I write this all I can think of is—  bought off againl The temptation is strong  at this point to generalize wildly about  similarities between simian and human  social behaviour.  But before we begin bending their behaviour  patterns to fit the human condition, let's  remember the dangers in assuming ourselves  as recipients of a finished evolutionary  hand-me-down.  "We are probably the only animal that can  control our own biology," says Birute.  "Some others - chimps, maybe - can create  protocultures responsive to change, but  we are the only ones'who can make change  in our culture. We are not bound by our  biology in the way some female monkeys  "For example, in many species the females  are smaller than the males, they can't defend themselves, their territory is proscribed, they have no options. We have  two major options: we have birth control  - we can choose not to have children if we  want, and we can earn a living independent of men. Evidence shows we're getting  physically stronger and bigger, too."  Hrdy echoed the same point forcefully  during her lecture. "A society, such as  the present human society, that tries to  legislate equal rights is unique in  anthropological terms."  Equality between the sexes is not a process we can leave up to natural selection.  Instead we must fight for it "consciously,  with intelligence, stubborness and courage."  Hrdy also reminds us how fragile equality  can be. "Should it collapse, it is far  from certain that the scaffolding needed  to surmount oppressive natural and cultural barriers could ever be pieced together again." May 1982      Kinesis  REVIEWS  Protection a rare commodity for battered women  by Gayla Reid  Having grown up in a society in which  children can be beaten soundly for their  own good and women fall down the stairs,  we know that battered women need protection from their violent husbands. We  know, too, that such protection is hard  to find.  How can we make adequate protection a  reality?  In proposing answers to that question, A  Study of Protection for Battered Women,  a new publication from the Women's Research  Centre in Vancouver, does more than prove  ' that a woman who is abused by her husband  will be abused again when she turns to the  criminal justice system.  The study also pushes forward the feminist  offensive on male violence by providing  and examining workable models of legal,  social service and health care practices  which would afford a battered woman better  protection.  _ A Study of Protection for Battered Women  Women's Research Centre, 237pp, 1982  $8 individuals, $10 institutions. Price  covers cost of duplicating and postage.  Contact the Women's Research Centre at  #301-2515 Burrard St., Vancouver, B.C.  V6J 3J6.  The study begins with battered women themselves.  The women explain what happens  when they go to the police, to the JPs,  j to the courts, to the counsellors and,  all too often, back one more time to their  violent husbands.  Some women find a transition house and a  way out. But others—one in every five  murder victims—do not go looking for  justice again.  Confusion rampant in legal system  The study moves on to interview representatives from every level of the criminal  justice system, from police dispatchers  to judges.  It's all here, including information about:  * the process of laying charges  * the function of the justices of the  peace  * a comparison of criminal court and  family court  * sentencing  What emerges from the extensive interviews  is an indictment of the criminal justice  system by its own members. They describe  a system which seems at worst pernicious,  and at best, something of a shambles.  Confusion is rampant. Members of different sections of the system appear unfamiliar with each other's roles and often  distrust each other's decision.  When it comes to wife assault, the cops  don't trust the courts and they certainly don't trust the assault provisions of  the Criminal Code. Family court representatives see criminal court as a place  where "the guy gets less static, the victim gets less protection". Criminal  court workers see family court as being  too namby-pamby with batterers. And on  and on.  It's a mess.  And nobody, it seems, trusts the women.  I was amazed the police report was so  short.    They told me to go to family  court.    My lawyer refused.    They said,  "Go downstairs,  then."   The man at the  desk would not accept the charge.    He  said there was no proof.    I had on a  turtleneck sweater—typical for a battered woman,  hiding the marks.    Nothing was  done.    I went to family court.    They  said,   "Get a doctor's report".    Then back  to family court.    I saw a counsellor who  said,   "Why are you seeing me?    You should  see a J.P. "  This from a woman who had been tied up  and raped, who had lost consciousness  twice.  One consistent theme in the maze of confusion is this: wife assault is not  really a crime. When your husband beats  you up, it's somehow not as serious as  an incident of stranger-to-stranger  violence. Dictator in his own castle,  the husband rules supreme, an arm's length  away from the Criminal Code provisions  on assault.  .jhI  fe  jBiiT  pt*  JH y    Jf  V.H  '■'.:i  Indicative of this attitude is the use of  the vague generic term "domestic dispute".  The study points out that when a call  about wife assault comes into a police  station, it's classified as a "domestic"  or "family dispute".  This useless umbrella phrase covers everything from a fight between two armed  neighbours to a landlord-tenant shouting  match, from a woman being beaten by her  husband to an argument between friends.  "Domestic dispute" is, of course, sibling  to the coy and deceitful term "spousal  abuse".  (Heaven forbid that our language  admit these are crimes committeed by men  against women. )  When police do respond to "domestics",  they don't even know if they're going to  be dealing with wife assault. Their  characteristic response to wife assault  situations is, it turns out, one of non-  arrest. The frequent withdrawal of  charges by battered women is typically  met with a mixture of chagrin and resentment on the part of police.  Perhaps worse than the ignorance is the  indifference. A family court prosecutor  admitted, "At family court, you get  hardened to family violence. You forget  about the victim." And at criminal court,  "the prosectuors literally prepare the  common assault in the elevator."  The interviews indicate that the most  common sentencing decisions are probation  with a suspended sentence or conditional  discharge.  Legal protections proposed by the authors  of A Study of Protection:  * A mandatory response by police to wife  assault calls (which would not be classified vaguely as "domestic disputes").  * A mandatory arrest policy according to  guidelines more consistent with the  Criminal Code. (There is also provision  for a non-arrest option, where appropriate .)  * A central registry of restraining orders  and peace bonds, to facilitate enforcement  of such orders.  * A reverse onus provision in the show-  cause bail hearings to determine whether  the accused batterer should be released  on bail.  * No diversion of criminal assault charges  to family court. (The intent of family  court, the interviews reveal, is to protect not the woman but her relationship  with the batterer.)  * A scheme of minimum and graduated sentencing, with no conditional discharges.  Because discretion was found to operate  against the battered woman in most cases,  discretion would be eliminated as much  as possible.  These recommendations were shown to people  at every level of the justice system.  Their generally positive responses, together with the details of the recommendations themselves, will be of tremendous  interest to anyone working with battered  women.  Doctors don't ask about battering  As the report points out, improvements in  the criminal justice system alone will  not be enough to protect the woman who is  being beaten. Accordingly, the researchers  also interviewed people working in the  areas of health and social services and  drew up appropriate recommendations for  change.  Few health professionals ask a battered  woman if she is being hit. Medical,  public health and mental health practitioners who were interviewed agreed that  "doctors don't ask the question, so the  referral never happens." Too often, the  battered woman is described as "a depression with relationship problems."  The attitudes of health professionals  towards wife assault "are shaped by training Which is family or individual oriented,  socially non-interventionist and focussed  on the needs of children over the needs  of their battered mothers."  Any reference made by a woman to abuse  probably means there is a lot more going  on, said one psychologist, who added:  It's important to be very clear, as a  therapist,  about your judgements about  him to her.    You must be clear to her  that you think he is wrong in hitting her  ...you have to let her know that over and  over again.  Improvements in the medical response to  wife assault would include the development  of better interview and assessment skills,  and explicit guidelines for emergency room  staff, private practice physicians, public  health staff, community mental health  staff and therapists.  The battered woman is invisible not only  to workers in the health field. To social  service workers as well, the battered  woman is no one's real responsibility.  Ministry of Human Resources workers often  do not assess battering as a problem; or  if they do, they see it as falling outside  the Ministry's mandate of supporting the  family unit.  Essential services which the Ministry  could provide (such as childcare and  monies for clothing) are often unavailable  continued on page 14 10     Kinesis      May 1982  May 1982      Kinesis      11  NUCLEAR POWER  Nuclear testing in Pacific Ocean has brought radiation and destruction to a former paradise  by Peta Joyce  "Come choose your own paradise island,"  the advertisement says.  "Miles of golden  beaches untouched by human foot, and the  most beautiful coral reefs in the world."  The tourist literature inviting you to  holiday in the Marshall Islands conjures  up all the usual images of a Pacific Paradise, and indeed the Marshall Islands are  beautiful, but danger lurks beneath the  crystal-clear waters, lies waiting on the  sun-washed beaches...  Nuclear testing started here  Since 194-6, over 180 atomic and hydrogen  bombs have been detonated in the Pacific  region, by the United States, Britain and  France, and 66 of those were in the Marshall Islands.  These tiny islands in the Northwest Pacific, administered by the United States as  a United Nations Trust Territory since  1947, were the first to experience nuclear  testing.  In 194-6, just six months after  the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, United States Navy officials chose  Bikini Atoll as an "ideal" testing site.  Its population of 167 people were moved  125 miles east to uninhabited Rongerik  Atoll. Because the Americans told the  Bikinians that they would be able to return  to their island when the tests were over,  they chose to go to Rongerik even though  it had meagre land and lagoon resources  compared to Bikini.  Meanwhile, two atomic bombs about the size  of that dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, were  expoloded at Bikini, and the United States  Navy decided that Enewetak Atoll would  also be used for testing. The 145 people  who lived on Enewetak were taken to a much  smaller atoll, Ujelang, and testing continued on Bikini and Enewetak Atolls for  several years.  Bomb dropped without warning  In 1954 a series of tests included "Bravo",  a 15-megaton hydrogen bomb blast, which  contaminated all the islands east of Bikini  with radioactive fallout. Within hours  of the blast, a "gritty white ash" began  to fall. On Rongelap the ash was two  inches deep, and by nightfall the people  began to experience severe vomiting and  diarrhea. At no stage were there any  official warnings of the test, nor any  notification of precautions to take.  More than 48 hours after their exposure,  28 United States Air Force and Army men  stationed at a weather monitoring station  on Rongerik were evacuated along with the  64 people on Rongelap.  In all 264 people  were eventually evacuated to the Kwajelein  Navy base. They experienced the symptoms  of severe radiation exposure:  itching and  burning skin, vomiting and diarrhea, skin  burns and loss of hair.  The Rongelap people, after three months  of examination and treatment on Kwajalein  were temporarily resettled on another  atoll, while others returned to their  contaminated islands. After the Bravo  test, the off-limits zone around Bikini  was increased by eight times, and included  inhabited atolls, although no people were  ever evacuated before subsequent tests.  In 1957 the Rongelap people returned home,  their atoll having been pronounced "safe"  for habitation, "in spite of slight lingering radioactivity". A United States  Brookhaven National Laboratory report  stated that "the habitation of these people  on the island will afford most valuable  ecological radiation data on human beings".  The United States concluded its nuclear  testing program in the Marshall Islands  in 1958, but more was to come. In 1959  Kwajalein was chosen as the testing site  for nuclear missiles.  Marshallese still fight for compensation  Apart from the immediate effects of nuclear testing, the Marshall Islands people  have suffered in other ways.  The Bikinians, concerned about the meagre resources  on Rongerik, made the first of many requests to return home just two months  after their arrival. Two years and many  hardships later, they were moved to a  temporary camp for seven months before  being resettled on Kili, a fertile island  but with no lagoon or safe anchorage.  The Bikinians, like other islanders who  were hurriedly resettled with little time  to establish housing and gardens, and to  make fishing equipment, became dependent  on the infrequent and unreliable Trust  Territory supply ships. Many times people  were left for months without basic supplies, having to eat the copra which was  their only source of income.  With a long history of protests, petitions,  and law suits behind them, the Marshallese  are still fighting for adequate compensation, or the return of their ancestral  lands, and for the right to be treated as  equals in their own country.  Some will never be able to return home; a  1978 Northern Marshalls radiological survey, forced by a law suit in 1975 by the  Bikinians, reveals that "Bikini Island  could not be used by the people of Bikini  for at least the next 30 years and possibly the next 60 years." Meanwhile the  Bikinians are still searching for a satisfactory place to live.  There is one thing the Marshallese cannot  fight for: their health. Four years  after their exposure to radioactive fallout, the rate of stillbirths and miscarriages among Rongelap women rose to more  than twice the rate in unexposed Marshallese women.  Thyroid tumours widespread  There were problems on other islands too.  Minji Kel from Utirik Atoll: "...Several  of my babies who were healthy at the time  they were born died before they were a  year old...Altogether I lost four babies.  My son Winton was born just one year after  the bomb, and he has had two operations  on his throat for thyroid cancer."  Nine years after their exposure in 1954,  the first thyroid tumours began appearing  among the Rongelap people, and there was  a higher than normal incidence of growth  retardation in the young. By 1966, 52%  of the 29 children who were under ten  years old in 1954 had devloped thyroid  abnormalities.  Furthermore, the body levels of radioactivity of Rongolapese who were not exposed in 1954j but who had moved back to  Rongelap in 1957, were found to be the  same as those who were exposed, which  indicates the level of contamination on  the island. -  In 1976, a medical report showed that 69%  of the Rongelap children under ten years  old, and 35% of the total population exposed in 1954, had developed thyroid  tumours. However, the people of Utirik,  whose original exposure was less than one  twelfth of the Rongelap peoples', suddenly showed a higher rate of thyroid cancer.  A Brookhaven Laboratory medical report  pointed out that the Rongelap children received doses of radiation high enough to  kill many body cells, whereas at lower  doses, as in the Utirik people, "a greater  number of cells would be spared for malignant transformation".  Americans still claim islands are "safe"  In 1978, 20 years after the nuclear testing stopped, the Department of Energy  revealed that ten other islands (of about  not even a body there." The women call  them jellyfish babies. Sometimes the  doctors won't even let them see their  babies.  Darlene was born on Ebeye, an indigenous  labour camp for Kwajalein workers and  their dependants. 8,000 people live on  66 acres of land, in substandard housing,  with no recreational facilities except  for a basketball court and a baseball  field, and a poorly equipped, maintained  and staffed hospital. There is one Trust  Territory and one volunteer doctor.  Nearby Kwajalein has a population of  3,000 Americans, with air-conditioned  housing, a high school, tennis and handball courts, swimming pools, parks, a golf  In 1957 the Rongelap people returned home, their atoll having been  pronounced "safe" for habitation, "in spite of slight lingering  radioactivity". A U.S. Brookhaven National Laboratory report stated  that "the habitation of these people on the island will afford most  valuable ecological radiation data on human beings. "  1600 people) were contaminated with radioactive fallout.  Unlike most Marshallese, who have never  been told about the effects of radiation  on themselves, their children, or their  environment, Darlene Keju knows that the  whole of the Marshall Islands is contaminated, because of the health problems  that her people are experiencing. Two  years ago she returned from her studies  in Public Health in Hawaii to investigate,  and found many problems never before experienced in the islands.  Apart from health problems such as sores,  tumours, thyroid disorders, stillbirths,  miscarriages and deformed babies, staple  crops such as arrowroot and breadfruit  are dying out or are difficult to grow.  The women told her that they had many  miscarriages at seven months, or, if the  baby was full term, "something" was born;  "... it's moving, it's breathing, but there  is no eyes, there is no arms, there is  course, bowling alley, teen club and free  movies. There are seven American-trained  doctors.  On Ebeye, Darlene has to obtain a pass to  get to Kwajalein, and she was forbidden  entry once to see her brother even  though she had obtained a pass. Marshallese cannot shop for the cheaper goods on  Kwajalein, nor send their children to  high school even though Ebeye doesn't  have one.  Darlene was seven years old when she first  experienced a nuclear bomb. She was at  a birthday party, and the minister who  was just about to bless the child and the  food when the bomb went off, told them it  was the end of the world. The whole island glowed orange and red as Darlene ran  home to find her parents. She wanted to  know if they were going to heaven or hell.  Now, 23 years later, Darlene has had one  tumour removed from her shoulder, and  still has three others in her body.  . .  The Americans still say that the islands  are "safe", and that there are no problems for those not directly affected by  the radiation. Darlene points out that  these problems occur all over the Marshall  Islands, including areas that the Americans claim were not contaminated.  "So what does this mean to a Marshallese?  Not only that some of our bodies, some of  our relatives, some of our friends, have  gone, but also it means to us that we are  now dying out slowly. We know that there  is no cure for us."  The Marshallese have limited health care;  once a year the Department of Energy carries out a medical survey of the Islands,  and people needing treatment are sent to  Hawaii or the United States. The doctors  tell them, "...there is nothing wrong,  nothing to worry about, your ticket is  paid for, we have a translator waiting  for you, have a good time on the mainland."  Islanders exploited for radiation data  Darlene's statment is backed up by Reuben  Merliss, an American doctor who visited  the Marshall Islands in 1980. "The people  ...have no great faith in these (Dept. of  Energy) physicians...1 am also impressed  with the failure of the physicians to  communicate findings and prognosis to the  people... These basic rights of a patient  have been in a large part ignored...I  found very few Marshallese who were acquainted with the nature of their pathology.  I reject firmly the thought that the  people were too primitive or uneducated  to absorb such information, since I have  found this not to be true."  The Marshallese have made repeated requests  for an independent medical survey.  In  1971 a Japanese medical team was prevented  by the Americans from travelling to Rongelap and Utirik because of "visa" problems.  Although over 200 million dollars have  been spent on "clean-up" operations, Darlene believes that this is not to make  the islands "safe" to live, but so that  the Marshallese will return to their own  homes to provide human data on the possible effects of nuclear war.  The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory study  on Bikini in 1977 stated that "Bikini may  be the only global source of data on  humans where intake via ingestion is  thought to contribute the major fraction  of plutonium body burden...It is possibly  the best available source of data for  evaluating the transfer of plutonium across the gut wall after being incorporated  into biological systems."  "Come together and fight like hell"  Darlene is fighting for awareness of the  problems of the Marshall Islanders, and  of other Pacific peoples.  "The time has  come for Pacific Islanders to come together and fight like hell.  I'm tired of  having outsiders coming in and treating  me like a guinea-pig... of lawyers and anthropologists representing me...It stinks,  but they do it because we give them the  power...Stop depending on outsiders, they  will screw you like they have screwed  us."  "Sooner or later I will disappear," says  Darlene, "and in 20 or 30 years from now  the Tahitians will face the same problems.  We must learn from each other."  Meanwhile, in 1981 the Marshall Islands  Government was approached by the Japanese  about the possibility of using Bikini Atoll  to "store" nuclear waste. The tourist  agencies are keen to continue the exploitation; come pick your own island...  Marie-Therese Danielsson confirms that  there is already an unusually high rate  of thyroid problems in Tahiti, but there  are no official figures; the French stopped all health statistics before the bomb  tests started, and there has been no information since. But she knows that large  numbers of Tahitians are sent to France,  Australia, and New Zealand every year for  medical treatment.  Ocean pollution poses serious hazard  If these problems are already appearing  in Tahiti, what about the rest of the  Pacific? As Darlene says, "If our area  of the ocean is polluted, the whole  Pacific is polluted."  The New Zealand National Radiation Laboratory figures show that New Zealand received both tropospheric (highly radioactive, short-lived fission products in  the lower atmosphere, including iodine-  131) and stratospheric radioactive fallout (long-term fission products in the  upper atmosphere, including strontium-90)  from the French tests.  The wide grazing habit of cows leads to  the concentration of some of these radiation products in milk, and so milk is  another useful indicator.  Iodine-131 is important because it is  selectively absorbed into the thyroid.  Children, because of their small thyroids,  receive higher doses than adults from the  same intake (hence the large number of  thyroid problems in Marshallese children).  Iodine-131 becomes concentrated in milk,  and children are also likely to have a  higher daily consumption of fresh milk.  Strontium-90 is deposited with calcium in  human bone. The levels of strontium-90 in  food indicate both the rate of stratospheric fallout and the accumulated ground deposits. Whereas rainwater levels of strontium-90 have steadily decreased since the  French atmospheric tests stopped, the  levels in milk have not decreased at the  same rate.  Thus radiation products, absorbed from the  soil by everything that is grown on land,  are still entering our bodies through the  food chain.  Frightening though this is, the effects  of nuclear pollution in the ocean, and in  fish, may be even more serious. What  effect is this already having on us and  our children? What relevance does the  American finding that lower doses of radiation produced a higher rate of cancer in  the Marshallese have for us?  While the Western world is preparing for  the possibility of nuclear war, people in  the Pacific are already dying from it.

This is the dilemma Sabotage  addresses.  Sabotage,   a video installation exhibited  at Open Space Gallery in Victoria from  March 16 to April 3,  was created by three  Vancouver artists: Barbara Swail, Wendy  Solloway and L.E. (Freddy) Fraser.  around us.  The installation includes a series of video  (TV) monitors and "found objects" such as  a garden trellis, newspapers, wire, a  painting, blueprints, articles of clothing  (pink), clotheslines, masks and construction materials.  The layout of the piece is based on two  triangles. The "inner triangle" is drawn  on the floor with orange tape, the angles  of which harbour the video monitor constructions. These works are built up from  Sabotage attempts to lead the viewer on a  journey from traditional patriarchal culture, through times of change, into an  ideal world. The artists mold this concept  with materials as well as construction  techniques into a whole, the whole being a  journey.  The artists state: "We are women who came  together to create a video work reflective  of the feminine experience of this world.  Women are emerging from centuries of masculine defined culture. We see it as a culture of sabotage. As we move out of and  away from our cultural origins, in the  effort to create a new context and style  of being, we leave behind everything that  ever offered a support.  "It is necessary to move through confusion,  doubt, anxiety; a turbulent time of testing, questioning, discarding and reforming  before emerging with the material to build  and create a new context" with room for  feminine and masculine qualities of living.  We are looking ahead with this in mind."  Compositionally, Sabotage  leads us out of  the world of structural categories of  painting, sculpture, fabric art and video  and into a wider appreciation of the world  the floor.  The "outer triangle" is drawn on the floor  in silver "gaffer" tape, its sides marked  by clotheslines hanging above and behind  the monitors. Attached to the lines are  clothes, blueprints and masks, which hanging towards the floor imply walls.  Upon first seeing this installation, I was  reminded of Native Indian cultural themes.  At Open Space, Sabotage was nestled into a  spot halfway down the gallery space. It  appeared as a teepee would if set up in a  clearing and like a teepee,the piece is  totally self-contained.  In one corner stands a "totem", made from  a pile of video monitors, stacked one upon  the other.  In the second corner, a monitor and a  bright orange construction pylon sit atop  an assemblage of crumbling grey cement  blocks. This entire assemblage is swathed  in grey gauze-like material which rises  above the clotheslines, appearing as a sort  of fire-place with smoke billowing into  the air.  The third corner, the "ideal", has a monitor woven into a web of black and yellow  cords and a wooden lattice. This piece sits  on a torn painting of blues and orange,  suggesting fluidity. Objects hung from the  lines imply sky, while the structures  built up from the floor suggest the earth.  The artists see the"totem" corner of the  piece as representing women's place within  the patriarchy. The "confusion, doubt,  anxiety" are represented by the "fireplace" corner, while the "ideal" corner  is a woven web. The journey begins with  the "totem", moves through the "fireplace"  and ends with the "ideal".  Inner triangle evokes urban scenery  My impression of Sabotage  changed when I  entered the "inner triangle". What becomes  apparent from this point of view are piles  of discarded televisions, a crumbling  cement wall, graffiti, newspapers and bits  of wire strewn about the floor. The- installation becomes a 20th century urban scene  - a back alley experience of looking over  clotheslines into someone's yard.  An apocalyptic inference is added to the  atmosphere by the masks which hang from  one of the lines. One is a black masquerade  mask, one a skull-like hockey mask, and  the third a (plastic) woman's face.  It is a video tape displayed on the monitors, however, which gives direction to  Sabotage.  On the opening night of the installation, the artists staged a "performance" which they taped.  That tape is displayed simultaneously on  three monitors in the installation (one at  each corner of the inner triangle) once  the player is turned on. The viewer has  the choice of listening to sound from all  three monitors (omnipresent), or turning  down the sound on the others and listening  to only one.  The viewer also has the choice of watching  the tape all the way through to the end on  one monitor, or of turning her head and  moving into the next part of the tape on  another set.  Each monitor is adjusted to a colour balance congruent with the particular colours used in that corner of the triangle.  The "totem" monitor, for instance, displays]  a pink colour balance emulating the pink  clothes on the line behind. The "fireplace" monitor is adjusted to grey tones  with occasional streaks of orange, while  the "ideal" monitor is balanced for blues  and oranges found in the painting on the  floor in front of it.  Sound gives form to environment  The tape begins with artists Wendy, Barbara and Freddy entering the installation  space wearing masks, which they remove and  hang on the line.  From here Barbara takes over the camera  work, Wendy begins playing her bass guitar  and Freddy starts drawing in her notebook.  The camera follows the installation from  the "totem" towards the "ideal", incorporating shots of Wendy and Freddy as they  perform. In moving from Freddy's drawings  back to the clotheslines, the camera connects the work-in-process with the components of the_installation.  The visual effects of the video are particularly interesing around the "fireplace"  piece. The cement block are back-lit, thus  light and shadow coming through the blocks  and the gauze cause a glowing "halo" effect  on the screen.  continued on page 14 CULTURE  May 1982      Kinesis      13  P4W proves that a true story tells itself  When the film P4W had its Vancouver premiere  in March,  Pat Feindel was there to interview filmmakers Janis Cole and Holly Dale.  Janis and Holly have worked together for  six years,  and have produced the following  films:     Cream Soda, Minimum Charge No Cover,  Thin Line, and  P4W (Prison for Women).  Pat:    I've only seen two of your four films,  but it seems you prefer the documentary  format.     Can you tell me why?  Janis: Well, we got into documentary  right at the beginning so we've stuck with  that, but we plan on doing dramas in the  future.  In fact, we've written a feature  script and we're now writing a TV script.  We think the experience of getting to  know people really well through documentary will help when we're characterizing  people in dramatic situations.  Pat:    How do you go about deciding what  your subject is going to be  — what sort  of criteria duo you use?    For example,  when  you did this film,  did you decide you  wanted to do something specifically on  prisons and women?  Holly:  I think what we do is take people  that society labels as social deviants or  stereotypes and show them as people, that  they're not that different from you and  I except that they've chosen a path in  life that's a bit different.  Janis: From the first, we wanted to focus  on the women and not the prison — I mean,  the prison's going to come into it because  that's where they are — but the thing was  always to present them as people and focus  on them rather than the system. I think  the system becomes evident just through  getting to know them.  Pat: It's interesting then that it's be  come a kind of political film. Did you  anticipate that?  Janis: '(laughter) No, that's just the  way it went. The way we make films is  we just present the material the way we  actually experience it.  Holly:  .the way it i  i presented to i  Janis: ...so what happens is people are  able to make their own kind of political  conclusion from it. Different people see  it different ways and whatever is important to them, that's what they focus on.  Holly: You see, documentary filmmakers  tend to go into a place, observe it,  formulate their opinions and then make a  film that throws their opinions on the  audience. We go into a place, observe it,  and try to stay as true as we can to the  material as it was presented to us.  That way.we're not really making any  statements but subsequently the film makes  a lot of statements because people are  able to make up their own minds, so that  a lot more than just a slanted manipulated  opinion comes through.  Pat:    So your objective was mostly to present the people as human instead of as  stereotypes.     Did you have any notions  about what kind of changes you would want  to occur or how you would want the audience  to react?  Holly: No, no. Of course, we want the  audience to like the film or feel they've  gotten something out of the film — the  word "like" is strange to use in these  kinds of films. But we never want to keep  them from having their own freedom of  thinking the way they want.  Like Maggie in the film, who's a double  murderer — some people will look at her  and say, "I felt sympathy for her"; some  people will look at her and say, "She  should be locked up forever because she's  killed twice".  Pat:    When you were making the film,  what  were your own impressions of the women?  Did you form judgments of your own that  you had to make an effort to keep out of  the film?  Janis: We tried to keep our own judgments  out of the film, but you do form judgments  from getting to know people. For instance,  I think Janice's situation was a real  shame. I think her sentence is definitely  too long for her involvement. We read all  the transcripts on her case and researched  it in full, and it seems to me it was a  very political thing that she ended up  getting 25 years in prison.  Pat: Your film is being seen by a really  varied audience — from prison inmates to  people who breeze into Robson Square Media  Centre.    I wonder if .you anticipated that?  Holly: No, we didn't anticipate that wide  a range of audience at all.  Pat: Before you shot the film, did you do  much scripting?  Holly: No, we don't script our films at  all. What we do is we go in, we find out  as much as we can about a person, we read  their transcripts, we go to the library  and look up the court report, we speak to  the court reporters. We get all the background we can and then we find out what is  the key thing to this person's life and  situation here.  In Maggie's case it was  her children and being a battered wife.  And we just focus in, we write our  questions around what we want to get out  of them. We think of the best way to  phrase it to get the feeling we want. For  example, when Maggie was dusting (her  dresser) and the card (from her son) was  there, I said to her, "Why don't you read  "What we do is take people that  society labels social deviants or  stereotypes and show them as  people, that they're not that  different from you and I except  that they've chosen a path in life  that's a bit different."  the card for us?"  She didn't expect that — we didn't  tell her in advance, we're going to get  you to read the card or anything. So she  just picked it up and all of a sudden she  was...well, naked because her emotions  were there and she was trying to hold them  back, but she couldn't quite hold them  back. Those kinds of things, the spontaneity of the situation, are what we're looking for.  Pat:    What difficult editing decisions did  you make and how were they affected by  your initial goal in making the film?  Janis: Okay, we shoot a lot of cinema  verite and direct cinema, so we tried to  string it out in the order we'd shot it,  and that was anti-climactic. So we started reworking it, and tried to present it  in the way we felt  the experience, which  was going in and thinking things aren't  too bad here, and there's some neat people  and it's kind of fun.  Then we got to know more about them and  why they were there — some more emotional  stuff — and it became very frustrating  towards the end. We saw the frustrations  in dealing with the everyday petty things  and dealing with the prison itself, so we  structured it that way. And I think what  happens is it gives it a sort of dramatic  feeling, a story feeling, because you have  a beginning, middle and end.  Holly: We don't feel a documentary should  just be informative.  We feel it should  be entertaining. You should be able to  laugh and cry.  Pat:    You chose not to use any kind of  narration...  Holly: Yes. To us that's telling people  what to think. We've used narration but  it was used for the effect. We really  refrain from it unless it's part of the  art process.  Pat: In the two films I've seen  (Cream  Soda, P4W) your subjects are women.  Would  you call yourselves feminist filmmakers?  Janis: Well, you missed the two where  one is totally about men and the other is  pretty well equally about men and women.  Holly:  ...transvestites and transexuals.  No, we think of ourselves as filmmakers  first.  If we said we were feminist filmmakers we would be hypocrites, because the  whole reason we make films about the people  we do, is we hate labels. To label ourselves as feminist filmmakers puts us in  a slot, and that's the one thing we try  to break down in our filmmaking.  continued on page 15 14     Kinesis     May 1982  PROTEST  SABOTAGE continued from page 12 -  Feedback, achieved by aiming the recording  video camera into a monitor, creates a  whirling of colours on the screen - repeating the fluidity found in the painting on  the floor and carrying through the sense  of a graphic language established by the  wire, cords, graffiti and Freddy's drawings.  The sound created by Wendy's bass guitar is  a low, slow resonant sound that Wendy describes as "drone and funk". Standing within the "inner triangle", the sound feels  like a heartbeat, giving the illusion that  the piece is a living organism. The sound  gives form to the environment, providing a  space in time for the performance, as well  as a vehicle for the camera and the drawing. When the music ends, the performance  is over.  The performance itself is rather like a  "jam session" among musicians, except that  in this case two of the participants are on  camera and drawing.  Many elements of Sabotage  can be read quite  literally. For example, the artists expressed several times when interviewed that  they feel vulnerable with Sabotage.  They  are put "on the line" - their "unmasking"  at the beginning of the performance is a  metaphor for their public unmasking in the  Sabotage  piece.  Another example of literal elements is the  "totem" piece, which has powercords hanging unplugged in various places. This could  be understood as the powerlessness of women  in the patriarchy.  In contrast, the "ideal" piece has many  cords and connections threaded between the  monitor and its surrounding space. A heavy  orange cord folded in front of the "ideal"  monitor implies an abundance of power.  Wendy, Barbara and Freddy were brought together to work on this installation by the  Open Space Collaboratory Program.  L.E. (Freddy) Fraser studied at Emily Carr  College of Art. She has exhibited her work  at, among other places, Robson Square and  Presentation House. Freddy has worked in  theatre as well, doing lighting, costumes  and scene painting. She has won both Helen  Pitt and B.C. Cultural Fund Scholarship  awards, and currently works as a freelance  artist.  Wendy Solloway is a performing musician,  currently playing bass with the "Persist-  ers", a Vancouver women's band. She has a  Bachelor of Musical Arts Degree and has  played publicly in Canada and the U.S.  Wendy has also worked as a composer and  performer for the National Film Board and  the C.B.C.  Barbara Swail attending Emily Carr College  of Art, and has an Educational Media Diploma from Capilano College. She has taught  video production for the Winnipeg School  Board, and has produced educational and  community oriented tapes for such groups  as Metro Media and the Department of Health  and Welfare.  Sabotage  marks the first time these artists have collaborated, and it appears  they have plans to continue working together. Women artists and audiences in  Vancouver would do well to request a  Sabotage  installation in this city.  BATTERED WOMEN continued from page 9  to battered women due to variations in  policy interpretations.  As in the legal and health fields, lack  of policy, funds and staff frustrates  those conscientious individuals (and  there are more than a few) who do understand the seriousness of wife assault  and are battling to do something about it.  Recommendations to the Ministry for more  adequate protection for battered women  include the development of a comprehensive  intensive training program for social,  financial aid and family support workers.  The program would be aimed "at increasing  their awareness of the nature and severity of the problem, and helping equip  workers to intervene appropriately in  battering situations."  There is evidence of solid, well-informed  research throughout A Study of Protection  for Battered Women.     In many ways, the  work is an extension of Battered and  Blamed,   a 1980 publication of the Women's  Research Centre which examined wife  assault from the perspective of battered  women.  The changes proposed in this study are  concrete, specific and possible. Neither  absurdly Utopian nor merely attitudinal,  they would make a difference to the daily  lives of thousands of battered women.

Its main ingredient, a labour pool which is largely immigrant,  female, and if possible ethnically, racially and linguistically separate from  the mainstream of Canadian life.  A Time to Rise  Produced and directed by Anand Patwardhan  and James Munro  Colour, 16mm, 40 min., 1981  Unlike most recipes, however, the aim is  to keep the ingredients disorganized. This  is where the Canadian Farmworkers Union  (CFU) and the filmmakers of A Time to Rise  seem determined to spoil the cuisine.  A Time To Rise  is a film which documents  the struggle of the Canadian Farmworkers  Union to organize the largely South Asian  farm labour force in the Fraser Valley.  But it's more than just,a documentary of  an important event in B.C.'s labour history.  Because it shows how the union was built,  A Time to Rise  is being used by the CFU as  an organizing tool in both the Fraser and  Okanagan Valleys.  It's also an educational tool suitable for  both adults and children. The B.C. Teachers  Federation is currently developing curriculum guides for the film for grades eight  and eleven.  Film produced under difficult conditions  A Time To Rise  is an inspiration for all  film artists who want to use their medium  to give voice to those who are rarely  heard. Nettie Wild, sound engineer of A  Time to Rise,   has described the satisfaction that making the film gave the crew.  The crew is to be commended, in fact, for  producing a technically high-quality film  under difficult conditions. It is appropriate that A Time to Rise  was the first  Canadian film to win the Silver Dove award  at the Leipzig Festival in West Germany.  Even if the crew had set out simply to  document the founding of Canada's first  farmworker-only union, the results would  have been worthwhile. But A Time to Rise  also informs us of issues which concern  farmworkers: piece-work rates, labour  contracting systems, lack of job security,  non-existent or ignored safety regulations,  and unsanitary working and living conditions .  We are shown the barriers farmworkers  encounter in organizing, such as violently  anti-union farm owners and the necessity  for organizing over fences and from public  roadways to avoid trespassing charges.  White male farm hands describe the racist  reasoning of those who want to discourage  them from joining the largely Punjabi-  speaking union.  One scene showing a fieldworker who decides  to join her peers in a union march reflects  the uncertainty most new members feel.  torieal interest. The curriculum work of  the B.C. Teachers Federation, for example,  will be wasted if more copies of this film  aren't available soon.  The National Film Board recently bought  distribution rights to A Time to Rise.  Yet almost a year after its completion,  the film is still not available from the  NFB's Vancouver office.  A call placed to the NFB office in Vancouver in early April revealed that no ship-  Pritam Kaur's determination in describing  her support for the union as she prepares  to leave her basement suite to catch a  6 a.m. bus for the fields is nothing short  of inspirational. This scene and others  show how the women in the film face the  problems shared by women generally, plus  more.  Homemaking and childcare add to the demands  of fieldwork. Sometimes tragedy results,  as when three young children wandered away  from their parents and drowned in an irrigation ditch.  Such stories only emphasize the irony of  one farmer's suggestion that fieldwork is  ideal for women because they can be close  to their children while working in the  fields. He seems to confuse the daily employment necessary to support a family  with a Sunday outing.  Perhaps the greatest frustration with this  film is the National Film Board's inability  to distribute it adequately. A Time to Rise  is a high-calibre film, but timing is  important if it is to be of more than his-  ping date was available, which meant the  film could arrive in "a couple of weeks  or a couple of months". The NFB's only  circulating copy is based in Ontario.  Such limited distribution is inexcusable.  Groups and individuals should phone or  write their local NFB office asking if the  film is available. Perhaps if there is  enough demand, the NFB bureaucracy can be  sped up.  In the meantime, a copy of A Time to Rise  is available from IDERA, 2524 Cypress St.,  Vancouver (phone 738-8815). IDERA charges  $30 film rental to community groups and  $60 to educational institutions. Since A  Time to Rise  is booked almost solid for a  month and a half in advance, it's advisable  to book early.  For those who live in the Lower Mainland,  the Canadian Farmworkers Union will send  their copy of the film along with a  speaker, or they will tell you where it's  being screened near you. Rental rates are  approximately the same as IDERA's. Contact  the union at 430-6055.  P4W continued from page 13  Janis: We weren't even making the film  for theatrical release when we made it.  Holly:  It just went that way. The most  amazing experience was when we showed it  at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto.  All our screenings were sold out and at  the third one everybody was lined up outside; the police had to break it up. Then  we went inside the theatre and there are  all these "gold badge" people, 80 people  in the audience. You have to pay $1000  to have a gold badge, right?

Holly: First of all, the Ontario Arts  Council, then Canada Council. We went to  Studio D, the women's studio at the National Film Board, for processing and work-  printing. We didn't pay ourselves.  Pat:    How did you decide on the distribution method?  Janis: John Katz, who programmed it at  the Festival of Festivals in Toronto,  suggested we should distribute the film  theatrically and suggested Pan-Canadian  as the best distribution house in Canada  for 16 mm. films.  Holly: We were talked into it basically.  We didn't really see the potential but  -it's there.  Janis: We wanted to do it, of course. We  were very excited about them approaching  us — it's just we hadn't planned on that,  so it was a bit of a surprise.  Holly: We've shown in theatres like this  before, but we haven't had a "commercial"  run.  Janis: We haven't had popcorn at our films  before.  Pat: How do you distribute your other  films?  Janis: They're distributed through the  Canadian Filmmakers' Distribution Centre.  They have an office in Toronto and one in  Vancouver.

Referring to animals, the theory goes  that under stress, animals get an extra  shot of adrenalin which prepares them for  the emergency. This is known as the fight  or flight reaction. With the extra adrenalin and extra tension, the animal is  prepared to react quickly.  The stress theory says that people suffer  from this because they are hormonally  prepared for either fight or flight and  then do neither but just hang around  typing or talking. This is supposed to  give rise to a whole host of diseases  including ulcers, eczema, heart disease  and cancer, but excluding Bright's disease,  gonorrhea and bunions.  The first problem with this theory is  that the evidence from animals is fallacious. Animals rarely either fight or  flee in an emergency. What they mostly  do is stand around shaking.  A deer usually deals with men or wolves  by standing very still in a place where  The definition, besides being all-encompassing, is also internally contradictory. Pain is stressful; so might its  absence be. Boredom might be the greatest stress of all.  In practice, stress does not get defined  as simply anything. In articles and  lectures, stress usually includes those  things which make you feel bad and leaves  out those things which make you happy.  I forget what the term for this is, it  might be tautology: the situation in  which the definition incorporates the  conclusion.  In other words, if you  accept the definition, no other conclusion is possible. Stress is that which  is bad for you; anything that is bad for  you is stress.  One could just as easily call it X. X is  everything, but in practice, X is what  makes you feel bad.  I am suffering from  X today, otherwise why would I be writing  this. X is anti-X; the absence of X is  also X.  When everything or nothing is stress, it  is impossible to make a proper diagnosis  of any given condition. Everything might  Stress usually includes those things which make you feel bad and  leaves out those things which make you happy.  she blends in with her surroundings until  the danger goes away.  Only as a last  resort will the deer bound away, although  she is always prepared to do so.  But when she runs, she might get shot, so  her best chance is to stand around trembling with tension. She doesn't die from  the tension; she dies if the hunter shoots  her.  When confronted with a new or emergency  situation, farm cows will just stand  around rolling their eyes in terror and  rarely do anything either quick or constructive. Cows will stampede when bitten by masses of mosquitoes or blackflies  but then they just run in any direction  and in a complete panic, without any  sense about it.  It is very difficult to make pigs either  fight or run. They will snort around a  lot with hardly any provocation. Chickens  squawk and run about a lot, with or without stress.  Stress - everything and nothing  Furthermore, there are few ways in which  animals resemble people and theories  about people arising from the study of  animals have no value whatsoever. No  one would every consider treating disease  in cattle on the basis of studies done on  people.  Another problem with the stress theory is  that the definition of stress varies  according to what it is being used to  explain.  It may or may not include anger,  tension, hate, love, irritation, joy,  pleasure, work, idleness, insecurity,  pain, marriage, divorce, loss and many  more.  Stress could, in fact, be defined as  being alive. Everything that composes  human life, every facet of human emotion,  can be defined as stressful according to  the theory. The theory could even be  restated as "Life is hard" or "In sorrow  shall thou bring forth children".  be -caused by the pain of living; every- .  thing might be caused by the joy of living, or nothing may be caused by any of it.  One is reminded of Freud's death wish or  the existentialists' cosmic despair —  we are born, therefore, we must die. A  large body of male theorists deny that  anything good can happen betweeen those  two events.  Medical science has always been very  learned about the cause and cure of illness. Originally, illness was all caused  by bad humours, bad air or an imbalance  of certain elements. The cures were various, including a lot of bleeding and  leeches.  Medical science, after many thousands of  years, acknowledged that some illnesses  have discernable and curable causes.  However, as the ability of any individual  medical scientist to discern these causes  is almost nil, in practice hardly any  disease is found to have its own cause.  A blanket diagnosis to cover everything  is necessary if doctors are to continue  to be rich.  For a while, every disease without a cause  immediately discernable by the medical  scientist at hand was thought to be due  to sexual repression. Sexual repression,  like bad humours and imbalanced elements,  is all-encompassing and explains everything .  There was also the matter of sin, which  everyone knew caused disease, but doctors  weren't too pleased to share their practice with priests so they de-emphasized -  sin as a cause for disease.  Mental illness was at first just ignored.  In the 1800's when lunatic asylums in  Western Europe became big business, masturbation was said to be the main cause  of mental illness. This gradually diminished in favour of bad motherhood; now  mental and physical illness are considered  to have common causes, i.e. bad mothers  and stress.  The main problem is, of course, lack of  treatment. Where do you go to get treatment for anything these days without the  implication that it's all In your head  because you can't cope properly? How can  you have any self-respect, how can you  demand treatment, when you know you are  causing yourself to have cancer?  The obvious treatment for stress-induced  illness would be to eliminate the stress.  But since it is all-pervasive, only cadavers can be free of it and that hardly  seems like a cure. The best we can hope  for is to learn to "deal with" stress in  a variety of ways including meditation,  love, religion, tranquilizers, etc.  If stress is pain, then the problem with  stress is that it is painful. And if the  pain isn't due to stress, treatment for  stress will not affect the pain.  If a person has a bad back, for example,  she cannot go for treatment of her back;  her whole life is cast into question.  She cannot be cured for it is obvious  that she lacks something essential in her  character, otherwise she would not have  succumbed to stress.  The only reason the stress theory has  stayed around at all is because it has  become intertwined with the world view  of the ME syndrome. According to a whole  spate of books and magazines, looking  after number one is the only respectable  occupation.  The most important aspect of this outlook  is that it supposes it really is possible  to isolate an individual from her surroundings.  Stroking oneself properly makes the  world go away, we are told.  Well, if one can control the environment,  one can control the "stress" in one's  surroundings.  If you don't do this, then  you have caused your own illness by perversely refusing to deal with your habits.  Nowadays the first thing asked of a sick  person is what she did wrong.  It adds an  enormous burden of guilt and embarrassment  to one who is already sick.  What is the purpose of life?  The most obvious problem with the concept  of illness-as-sin is the time and money  involved in the care and feeding of oneself.  It is a lifetime project and if you  spend your life just making sure you don't  sicken and die, then what is the purpose  of life?  And what about those who don't have the  time and money required? It seems like  the poor and the drunks and the mothers  are always with us; the rest of us just  have to make the time and money to look  after our bodies and minds properly. It  also gives us someone to feel superior to.  However, an even more overwhelming problem  is becoming obvious even in the short time  the ME generation has been running for its  life. That is — no matter how careful,  no matter how dietary, how strenuous, how  yogic, how meditative, how diodynamic -  people get sick anyway. Some even die.  So you either learn yoga and/or take tranquilizers and try to ignore your illness  and raise your consciousness sufficiently  to ignore death.  Or you make the futile  rounds of arrogant, overpriced and ignorant doctors prattling about stress, searching for a diagnosis which will result in  a cure.  And hope to stay relatively healthy and  alive until some more effective theory of  disease is invented.

Interested in regular part-time  work? Daycare centres all over Vancouver  need you.  When a daycare worker is off sick, is on  leave, or wants to take holiday time, a  big problem is finding someone to replace  her.  Some but not all centres request that  their substitutes be qualified and licensed. All want workers who are genuinely  interested in 3-5 year olds and can plan  programs for that age group. Pay scales  range from $5.00 to $7.00 per hour depending on the centre.  Interested? The SORWUC union office is  compiling a list of substitutes for its  day care centres. If you want to be on  that list, call 684-2834 during the day  and leave your name.  Final call for literary  submissions to Festival '82  FESTIVAL   '82:  A Celebration of Women in  the Arts will take place in Vancouver,  July 5-15, 1982, at Robson Square Media  Centre.  Literary events will include an evening of  readings by six well-known B.C. writers,  a paneldiscussion of issues currently  faced by women writers in Canada, a workshop in children's literature, a stage  production, a three hour open reading,  and an evening of poetry and music featuring eight more writers.  Women invited to read at this last event  will be selected from those submitting  manuscripts to the literature committee.  Please send poetry manuscripts to Helene  Rosenthal, Literature Committee Co-ordi-  nator, 2142 Mathers, West Vancouver, B.C.  V7V 2H3, no later than May 15, 1982.

CRIAW calls for papers on  Sexism in Research  In anticipation of its annual conference,  to be held November 19-22 in Ottawa, the  Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women is calling for papers on  the theme: Sexism in Research and its  Policy Implications.  This year's conference theme is based on  the premise that sexist research ought to  be the concern of all citizens and decision  makers because it so distorts the base on  which policy decisions are made, that they  are incomplete at best and counterproductive at worst.  CRIAW is calling for abstracts or proposals  (approximately 250 words) outlining potential research papers, panels or round  tables from researchers, policy-makers,  scientists, lawyers and people whose work  in the grass roots application of policy  reveals our theme.  All abstracts/proposals should be submitted by April 15, 1982 to:  Jill Vickers, Conference Convenor,  C/0 CRIAW, P.O. Box 236, Station B,  Ottawa, Ontario. KIP 6C4  IWD organizers propose year-  round committee  by Esther Shannon  Since 1974, Vancouver feminists have worked  hard to re-establish International Women's  Day as an important political tradition.  As women who have worked on organizing IWD  for the past two years, we feel it is  important to strengthen our commitment to  this event by developing a year-round  committee in place of the current ad hoc  group. This year's committee has decided  to issue a call to all interested women  to meet and discuss the establishment of  an on-going committee.  There are many reasons for Vancouver feminists to consider such a step. Due to the  short-term nature of IWD organizing, many  important factors are overlooked or receive  inadequate attention.  There is little time for creative action  or a dedicated outreach program that would  broaden IWD's appeal or its base of supporters. Invariably, events such as a march,  rally, information day and dance are selected which attract the same largely politicized constitutency.  Over the past two years, representation on  the IWD committee from established or newer feminist groups has been minimal. Not  only does this leave the IWD committee  without a solid base to report to, but it  limits the committee's access to contributions from women working day-to-day on  important women's issues.  For the women who serve on the committee,  its ad hoc nature creates unnecessary  strain. Following a two or three month  stretch of high pressure and constant  deadlines, few women feel like returning  the next year with their hard-earned  skills and resources. Women newly attracted  to working on the committee very often get  lost in the intense focus on the work at  hand, and don't return to further meetings.  In the long term, such a situation suggests  that IWD may become less and less a vehicle to present and promote the needs and  demands women are making. In addition, the  lack of a solid base makes IWD more vulnerable to take-over bids from groups  whose dedication to women's interests are,  to say the least, suspect.  With strong representation from feminist  groups on the committee, networking would  reach many women's organizations not part  of the women's movement, providing them  with an entry point and a means to maintain  links with the movement.  Increased outreach to trade unions and  their eventual participation on the committee is another strong possibility.  Clearly, IWD provides a good way for feminists to develop coalitions with other  organizations active in the struggle for  women's rights. This could be achieved  through sponsoring and endorsing IWD  events in the community at large.  A year-round committee would also allow  for such tasks as the translation of IWD  material to reach Vancouver's large immigrant and ethnic communities, as well as  to ensure better distribution of information.  IWD is an exciting vehicle that is, in its  present form, underutilized. We invite  and urge all interested women to attend  an initial meeting to assess the idea of  an on-going IWD committee. The meeting  will be held Tuesday, May 25 at 7:30 pm  in Room L5 at Britannia Community Centre,  Commercial and Napier, Vancouver.

We have tried to resolve  these controversies. Our experience has  proved that dialogue with Vancouver Rape  Relief is NOT productive.  We, the undersigned, withdraw our support  from Vancouver Rape Relief because we believe that they are no longer supportive  of women.  FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT VANCOUVER  RAPE RELIEF:  * is hierarchical;  * has an entrenched elitest leadership;  * is effectively closed to other feminists;  * misuses therapeutic and political tools,  e.g. constructive criticism;  * mystifies and does not share information  and skills, either internally or externally, thus creating a dependence on the  'leadership';  * does not provide a quality service to  women who have been raped by refusing to  support a woman's chosen action unless  deemed 'politically correct' by Vancouver Rape Relief;  * does not do either advocacy work or follow-up counselling, thus, in effect, limiting women's choices to a very narrow  range;  * exploits women's vulnerability at the  time of contact with the crisis line to  recruit them without that intent clearly  explained to women;  * has replaced training sessions with a  method of indoctrinating women through  the use of so-called 'radical therapy';  .* denies a woman the right to develop from  her own experience an individual consciousness of her own oppression;  * tells women that they bear some responsibility for their own victimization;  * is anti-lesbian. They believe lesbianism  to be a 'fear of men' rather than a positive choice to love women;  * has some members who do not support a  woman's right to choose abortion;  * has some members who do not support a  woman's right to fight back against violent men;  * protects rapists by not giving information to women who ask about their legal  options;  * puts the interests of rapists ahead of a  woman's right to decide whether or not  to use the legal system. Exploits and  adds to women's self-blame by portraying  the rapist as a victim of society;  * holds women responsible for reforming  men;  * protects the violent men in Men Against  Rape by not believing women who have  told about violence committed against  them by men in Men Against Rape;  * gives information which is supposed to  be confidential to Men Against Rape;  * has isolated itself from the women's  movement and has lost its credibility  with community organizations and institutions;  * refuses to refer women to anyone outside  of Vancouver Rape Relief;  * does not hold itself accountable to anyone. This includes women in their own  Support, Education and Action groups;  * believes itself to be the revolutionary  vanguard (i.e. they believe they are  leading the women's movement);  * has jeopardized the funding of the anti-  rape movement in B.C. Vancouver Rape  Relief has been saying since September  of 1980 that they would go off govern  ment funding by April 1982. After having  agreed to a contract with the government  for funding, Vancouver Rape Relief made  strategic decisions not to provide statistics as required under the contract,  which endangered the funding of the  Coalition of B.C. Rape Centres. A smokescreen was raised to the public; that  smokescreen was 'confidentiality'.  We refuse to choose between the government,  the police and other institutions, and  Vancouver Rape Relief.  We see another option and therefore some of  us are organizing a Women Against Violence  Against Women/Rape Crisis Group.  3)  For more information attend our women-only  in-movement meeting May 18, 1982 from 7:00  to 10:30 p.m. at First United Church, Gore  and Hastings Streets.

Signed: WAVAW/RCG May 1982     Kinesis      19  LETTERS  Women's centres need adequate  core funding now  Kinesis:  Through the lobbying efforts of many individuals and groups, the Secretary of State  Department tripled the Women's Programme  budget in the 1981-82 fiscal year. This  allowed many Women's Centres across Canada  to be core funded.  In the coming fiscal year, we understand  that the Secretary of State plans to "hold  the line" on the Women's Programme budget  of $3 million to be dispersed throughout  Canada.  Women's Centres received funding for only  part of the last fiscal year, and therefore will be requesting additional monies  to cover twelve months of operating in the  coming fiscal year. The Women's Programme  budget, as it now stands, will not be able  to accommodate this increase. This will  necessitate funding level cuts to many  Centres. We do not find this acceptable.  In this time of an economic downturn, resource industry towns are especially hard  hit. The social cost of lay offs and rising unemployment is astronomical. Women's  Centres have a vital role in easing the  burden on women in our communities.  We do not accept that Women's Centres  should perform fundraising activities to  meet a major portion of their operating  costs. Major fundraising is a significantly  draining use of our volunteer energies and  detracts from the legitimate activities  of an active Women's Centre. Would the  Department of National Defence hold a bake  sale to purchase another tank?  The Secretary of State Department has a  mandate to promote the status of women.  Women's Centres accomplish this. Through  the use of dedicated volunteers and paid  core staff, we can provide services with a  very favourable cost-benefit ratio.  Women's Centres are crucial! We want to be  funded in the same manner as Native Friendship Centres, which currently receive in  excess of four times the budget for the  women's programme. After all, we ARE 51$  of the population and are a sorely neglected and disadvantaged sector - especially  in isolated "male-dominated" resource areas  of Canada.  All levels of government as well as the  private sector have discriminated against  women in their policies and practices. It  is time to take some significant corrective  measures.  We are requesting a tripling of the Women's  Programme budget of the Secretary of State  (from $3 to $9 million). We are asking for  your support for that goal. Please contact  the Hon. Gerald Reagan, Secretary of State,  c/o House of Commons, Ottawa, to voice  your views.  Yours sincerely,  Pat Cathers, Chairperson  Terrace Women's Resource Centre  Bisexuality a valid choice too  Kinesis:  For lack of a better term (and I've tried  a few—including such outrageous handles  as 'omnisexual' and 'anarchasexual' —  interesting but horrid because they don't  really say anything, or else they say too  much), I am 'bisexual'.  Yep. Bisexual. It would be__truer, in fact,  to say I am 'sexual', because my feelings  are simply there, and are excited at times  by certain sounds, odours, sensations,  moods...far more than the particular gender  of a given individual.  You may ask why I announce this. No one  asked.  Well, it's because of certain theories,  certain remarks I hear that stack up in my  memory to culminate in one damn hunk of  irritation.  I am weary of being told that bisexuality  is a cop-out.  I believe I understand the  thinking behind it; that bisexual women  and men have at times the habit of standing timidly behind their hetero side,  leaving the oppressed half (and hence, its  brothers and sisters) to fend for itself  in the harsh right of day.  I agree that we must be vocal and strong  in our defense of. our right to love women,  or men, whatever our physical sex. However,  this timidity is the behaviour to be indicted, not the bisexuality that provides  the cover.  Goddamn it, I am bisexual. And although I  refer to myself as a dyke in a crunch (i.e.  when anti-gay remarks are being passed), I  am no more a lesbian than I am a heterosexual. Believe me, I have tried denying  first one aspect of my sexuality, and then  the other. It doesn't work, isn't natural,  and damn well isn't fair. Why is it feminist to free your lesbian self, and anti-  lesbian to defend your male-loving side?  Enough said. I think the shifty behaviours  are what should be attacked, not the sexuality. Rather than invite further division in the women's movement, I still believe we should defend everyone's  right  to choose - and not just to choose what  is politically 'correct' or preordained.  I am appalled that I am shit on by my  sisters for what is to me very clearly my  right, and the self-same fight as the  lesbian's.  In the spirit of tolerance and  self-respect,  Bran Way  Women's Building Society  dissolves  Kinesis:  When we convened the special meeting of  the Women's Building Society called for  February 18, it was apparent that sufficient interest to continue our efforts was  not forthcoming; we barely mustered a  quorum as set forth in our constitution.  A motion to dissolve the Women's Building  Society was passed and the following decisions were made on the disposition of  the Society's assets:  To set up a special trust fund in the  amount of $1>000 to be held for 3 years  from this date as seed money for a group  that might emerge during this period with  the same or similar goals, i.e., establishing a Women's Building in this area.  As well, that the 995 BCRIC shares donated continue to be held in trust at CCEC  Credit Union for the same period of time,  with the Vancouver Women in Focus Society  to act as trustees/executors of these  trusts.  In the event that no group emerges in the  stated period, these assets would go to  the trustees/executors cited above.  The Women's Building Society is withholding  only the amount necessary to get a final  mailing out and file the necessary provincial and federal reports.  $500 is to go  to the Vancouver Women's Bookstore to assist in covering some heavier than usual  expenses.  The balance of $4,150 goes to Women in  Focus and is specifically earmarked for  their Art Gallery, to enable them to continue this valuable cultural resource.  The Gallery has been such a wonderful contribution both to women artists exhibiting  there and to the women's community.  We thank all of you who so generously contributed your BCRIC shares and/or financial donations. We regret that the  dream did not become a reality at this  time. Hopefully, it will surface again—  and at least we have provided a start towards it.  Sincerely, and in sisterhood,  Women's Building Society  of Vancouver  Taking issue with S/M  Kinesis:  I would like to voice my disappointment  and opposition to an advertisement printed in the February edition of Kinesis.  This advertisement was for lesbians who  were interested in S/M and wouldn't mind  being photographed.  My first impulse, upon reading this ad,  was to feel uneasy and then to disbelieve  that S/M really meant sado-masochism.  After I'd determined that indeed the S/M  meaning was the given and accepted one, I  tried to forget about the advertisement.  I tried to rationalize - well,'we all need  money.  Wow, we don't need money that badly!  Kinesis  is a feminist newspaper, is it  not? As feminists we are fighting against  the violence and opression women face  daily. We have gone beyond the whole  freedom of speech garbage, realizing that  men should not be free to circulate pornography which validates sado-masochism  (among other things).  Would the women of Kinesis have accepted  such an advertisement from a man? Would  you accept such an ad from Hustler magazine?  For those of us who have seen Not a Love  Story,  we know that women photographers  are equally as sucked into the pornography  industry as men. What was in the minds  of the women who accepted this ad?  Sado-masochism is not an expression of  love.  It is an expression of power imbalance, oppression and societal sickness.  We must not condone this even when the  participants are women.  I sincerely believe that I am not taking  an unduly hard line on this issue. I request that Kinesis  no longer accept advertisements from women that they would  not tolerate from men. I suspect that  this ad would have fallen into that category.  I further request that Kinesis publish a  retraction at least the same size as the  original advertisement. As for the woman,  GIVE HER HER MONEY BACK. I'd be glad to  replace the amount if Kinesis is in that  bad a financial situation.  In sisterhood  R. Elaine Young  Editorial comment - We agree this is an  issue requiring a policy decision,  but as  yet we don't have the consensus to make  one.   Until such time as we do, we're not  prepared to retract this classified ad.  To clarify the issue of money, no, we  don't need the money that badly.  We do  not charge for Bulletin Board items; in  this case,  the woman submitting the ad  sent along a $3 donation.     We accepted it,  just as we do other donations.  We would very much like to see discussion  in Kinesis on the issue of sado-masochism,  as it seems to us an issue which is unresolved within the feminist community  as well. 20     Kinesis      May 1982  BULLETIN BOARD  JUST OUT  The following publications are available  from the Women's Research Centre, #301-  2515 Burrard Street, Vancouver V6J 3J6.
