We thought 'bout being really daring and telling the one about Martina  Navratilova and kd lang, but someone beat us to it—and it's not true anyway. Everyone's  talking about Gord and Judy but we switched off on that story ages ago and we're happy  to be able to keep you in the dark too. How about Kim Campbell's constructed "affair" (?)  with the entire country? Nah, that won't wash in Vancouver. Nobody cares! Actually,  speaking of Kimmie, seems like the horrendous amendments to the Human Rights Act  aren't going to go through after all 'cos Kim would have had to debate it in the House of  Cormorans (sorry) and she jus' can't take the flak right now...what with upcoming  conventions and elections and all..  Actually, thinking about Spring time doesn't exactly make our hearts bounce with pure,  unadulterated joy (there's a cliche—we promise, no more!) Yeah, we'll admit we're faking  our upbeatness...  ...the BC budget's on its way in and it's not going to be good news for most of us. At  a public meeting with finance minister Glen Clark last month, we got a taste of what it's going  to be like. Bureaucrats point at chart after chart in their painstaking, efforts to explain why  cuts are the way to go this year., .decade? Lifetime? You see, chart number one shows us why  the deficit is squeezing provincial coffers...chart number two shows why federal cuts to  provinces are squeezing provincial coffers...chart number three...  What we learnt from the forum was that we're all going to be poorer and the NDP loves  using charts, diagrams, and numbers. We were at an anti-N AFT A forum later in the month  [see page 3] and the MC was Joan SmaUwood, minister of social services—she only spoke  for a few minutes but she used a million charts to help her through it all...Well, we're smart  and not easily fooled. It didn't take us long to figure out that the province can't afford  increases to social services 'cos they're spending all the money on charts and projectors and  things like that...  Oh, before we forget, we received a press release as Kinesis goes to press announcing that  Smallwood's demanding "a national review of...federal/provincial cost-sharing safety  nets to help ensure the provinces...get a fair deal from Ottawa." What we think she's  wondering is how provinces are going to continue paying for ever-rising welfare costs...they  estimate over 10 percent of Brit. Columbians are on welfare...the press release has an awful  lot of "because of changes to federal social policies..." and "recession and economic  restructuring combined with federal policies..." and "due to federal off-loading of financial  obligations..." Sounds like they're preparing us for the worst...  Anyway, we're watching to see what happens in the next budget...to welfare rates, pay  equity, funding for women's groups and disabled people and ...and lots more. Read our  story next month.  Looks Hke that's going to be the only (official) budget we're going to have to deal with  this year...the feds aren't planning to have one 'till after the elections...speaking of which,  the NDP have promised 50 percent of their candidates will be women, the Liberals promise  us 25 percent, and the Tories are practically giving us Kim Campbell! Wow. Talk about  making it hard for us...?!!  Back to the feds, though. They finally made SecState Women's Programs permanent—  which means it won't have to be reviewed and renewed every five years any more...(gosh,  they do care) but they slashed funding by 10 percent—about one million dollars. There's no  questionabout it. ..they don't give a (we can say it but we won't) about women in this country.  The mainstream dailies make that clear too. When the disabled women's network  (DAWN) decided to close down their national offices because SecState slashed its funding  by almost two-thirds, we thought this was going to make the feds look real bad in the papers  the following morn. But hey, surprise! It took us hours to find it in The Globe until...yes, there  it is...a five-line blurb, barely an inch of text, buried deep inside the paper!  We thought we'd better mention the Alberta Status of Women is also closing the  doors—"at least until we receive our long-overdue cheque from SecState"—on both its  Edmonton and Calgary offices. Heck, that probably received 0.2 mm of text in the Globe  already and we missed it. Thank Bell for the telephone! Anyway, now that the staff's laid off,  one of them's offered to write a story about what's happening to women (and lesbians) in  Alberta—"it's incredible. Womenareunderattackfromalrnosteverysectorof this society.. .It's  hard to explain. I'll write." We're holding her to it.  Actually, this month is a juicy one for this column (by the way, hope you like it/hate it?  nobody writes to say they care any more...) 'cos there's lots of things going on. Or, at least,  coming up. The infamous Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women is supposed to  come up with its report this month. The infamous-er Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies should be out by June—we didn't say it will...it should.  Probably the biggest thing coming our way in terms of long-overdue, much-welcome  direct action is the Anti-N AFT A caravan to Ottawa [see page 3]. We figure it's about time we  all got together and swept the country up in a wave of socially progressive conscience., .think  about it.. thousands of people descend upon Ottawa to protest the Tory government's trade  agreement with themultinationals...it's the most powerful display of left-wing organization  and action... and The Globe gives it 2 inches on page 9...!!  Anyway, Women to Women Global Strategies dropped us a note to say women  interested in joining the caravan, attending their next meeting or buying their new, improved  anti-NAFTA T-shirts should call 430-0458.  More on NAFTA. Or is it AFTA. That's the Southeast Asian equivalent to NAFTA, kind  of—a large, homogenous market intended as a base for investment and a local market for  products. Anyway, sounds like there's talk afoot (another cliche?) of combining NAFTA and  AFTA (to make NAAFFTTAA??) to create a massive, trans-Pacific, free-trade zone. Hmm.  You'll notice we indulged and went with a two-page spread on International Women's  Day in this issue...that's 'cos we had some great photographs and transcripts of some  powerful speeches we wanted to share...and 'cos we jus' knew you wouldn't read about it  in the Globe and Mail. We've got a history of Press Gang Printers coming up in the next  issue., oh yeah, don't forget to support their latest fundraising bash on April.../see ad, page  7]. Minutes to go before we hit the presses and the phone's silent, no one's rushing in the door  with that last-minute notice...and we're going to go before they do...  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

Which does actually fit the "weather" inside—we're feeling pretty teary about saying goodbye to two terrific Kinesis gals.  After "four International Women's Day  issues at Kinesis," Birgit Schinke is leaving  her position as advertising and distribution  coordinator. She's been doing a great job  sellingadsanddistributing Kinesis and we're  sorry to see her leave. But with two kids,  grad school, and two—or is it three?—part-  time jobs, we knew she'd need a break from  deadline fever at the paper sometime. Hope  you get used to the new pace o' life, Birgit,  and thanks for working to help keep us  afloat all these years. We'll miss you.  Also leaving is Ed Board member Ria  Bleumer. Ria joined the Editorial Board at  Kinesis last year, when she organized the  Incredible Kinesis Writer's School. She's been  here ever since, and kept us all on our toes  with her latest idea for improving things  around the place. Dream—to set up a  permanent Kinesis writer's school, but got  caught up in jus' trying to pay her rent.  But not everyone's leaving! There's another new face around here, too. Shannon e.  Ash sat in on our last few Ed Board meeting,  "volunteered" to take the minutes, and decided that the Ed Board really did do some  pretty wonderful things. We thought she  did some pretty wonderful things too—no,  Shannon, not just taking minutes. But seriously, she's been writing regularly for a  while now, and we're glad tha t she's willing  to volunteer even more time to devote to the  bizness end of things. Welcome on [Ed]  Board, Shannon.  We have a few new writers this month:  Sur Mehat, our invaluable typesetter, makes  her debut, as does Mary Eaton, Sheida,  Fahahimeh, and Alice Swift.  Wielding blue pencil and exacto-knives  for the first time: Linda Barnard.  On another Kinesis topic, we've got our  annual Kinesis Benefit coming up in June,  and we'd like YOU to volunteer. Meet fun  women! Enjoy incredible music & comedy!  Sell lots of raffle tickets! (You knew that was  coming up, didn't you?) Call Anne at 255-  5499, if you'd like to give us a hand organizing this one-in-a-year E-vent.  We're still looking for volunteers who  are familiar with WordPerfect 5.1 and PageMaker 4.0, which we use to produce Kinesis.  We'd love it if you could volunteer time to  help train other volunteers on these programs. Call Anne at 255-5499.  And finally, we're always looking for  newwritersand production volunteers. Call  (604) 255-5499 if you've got a story idea, or if  you're willing to endure the waxy hands  and warm hearts of our production weekends (cookies provided).  come to the next  writers' meeting  April 5 @ 7 pm  #301-1720 Grant Street  call 255-5499 for info  all women welcome News  On To Ottawa Caravan:  Walking all over NAFTA  by Ellen Woodsworth  From BC to Newfoundland, from northern Quebec to southern Ontario, women,  children and men will march into Ottawa for  a mass demonstration on Parliament Hill on  May 15th.  The On To Ottawa Caravan was announced at a recent forum on the North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  in Vancouver last month to a crowd of about  2,000—the largest crowd at an anti-NAFTA  rally so far in BC.  It will be a mass cross-country action  "against free trade and against the corporate  agenda to send a message to the politicians  that whoever is elected in Ottawa, our agenda  is to put the people of this country first, not  the corporations," says Judy Rebick of the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women.  The caravan will start from Courtenay,  BC on April 16, and ma ke its wa y to Vancouver by April 18 [see mapfor details]. There will  be a rally in Vancouver at noon and many  will then accompany the caravan to Hope.  Everyone is welcome.  Furious that we are losing hundreds of  thousands of paid jobs and exhausted from  picking up the cuts to social services in our  homes, the message is simple: Women are  saying, no more! No to more cuts. No to  NAFTA. And no to governments that act as  agents for the transnational corporations.  There are plans to have a strong women's voice travelling in relays across this  land, so that our needs and our politics are  heard—and our politics are a clear part of  the rising tide of Canadians turning against  the corporate agenda.  As Rebick said in her speech at the rally:  "We need to unite all of the social move  ments in this country: the labour movement,  the women's movement, the nationalist  movement, the anti-poverty movement, the  anti-racist movement, disabled rights move-  ment, seniors, the environmental  movement...and we're going to hit every  town and city in the country and organizeand  mobilize and bring our message to Ottawa."  Groups involved in the planning of the  caravan include: NAC, Woman to Woman  Global Strategies, the Action Canada  Network, Greenpeace, the Canadian Labour  Congress, farmers, fishermen and women, seniors, Canadian Child Care Advocacy, and hundreds of other organizations  across Canada.  To help get the word out to women  across the country, NAC has hired a full time  organizer, Teresa Walsh. She will also coordinate the involvement of women's groups  for the caravan as it passes through towns  and cities.  Rebick will be joining the caravan in  Winnipeg. Farmers are joining with their  tractors, fishers with their boats, truckers  with their trucks. Everyone is doing banners  to send on to Ottawa.  Woman to Woman Global Strategies  will have t-shirts and literature available this  month. NAC will provide "No to NAFTA"  women's buttons, fact sheets, and flyers on  women and NAFTA for the May 15th rally  in Ottawa.  Women who want to join, need speakers or information, or can contribute money,  or plan a welcoming rally where they live in  BC can call (604) 736-7678. If you need information on action in other provinces, call  (604)522-7911.   Ellen Woodsworth'is a member of Women  to Women Global Strategies.  DisAbled Women's Network:  Cuts threaten dusk for DAWN  by Susan Briscoe  The national office of DAWN (Disabled  Women's Network) Canada was forced to  close its doors on March 31 due to federal  government funding cuts.  "We became a strong voice for disabled  women across Canada and we have to shut  down because...now they have not even  given us enough funds to do projects," says  Pat Israel, who made the grim announcement at a press conference in Ottawa on  March 17.  "We refuse to die a slow death as they  cut back more and more each year. We'd  rather die quickly right now," says Israel.  "We have no choice but to send the money  [from Women's Programs, Secretary of State]  back."  DAWN Canada applied to SecState for  $325,000. The organization was told it would  receive $132,000. When the cheque arrived,  it was for $120,000, to finance two projects.  No explanation was given for the additional  cut.  "Disabled women are the canaries of  the women's movement and the closure of  our national office shows what a profound  effect cutbacks are having on women's  groups," says Israel. (Canaries were taken  into the mines to gauge the breathability of  the air. If they died, the miners would evacuate the shafts before the air ran out.)  DAWN Canada was set up in 1985 to  address the particular issues that women  with disabilities face, issues that were not on  the agenda of disabilities rights groups or of  women's groups. The organization has been  responsible for increasing awareness of violence against women with disabilities and  conducting research about parenting, employment, self image, and reproductive technologies.  The national office of DAWN Canada  has been DAWN's liaison with the federal  government and has also worked on an  international level. DAWN has been trying  for years to get core funding to run its national office full time. But like other groups  which represent "doubly disadvantaged"  women, such as those for immigrant women  and women of colour, they have been denied these essential funds year after year by  the Tory government.  Joan Meister of DAWN BC is a past  chair of DAWN Canada. She calls the government cutback "stupid and senseless."  Meister says that, while the government  is happy to get good press from supporting  a disabled women's organization, they are  not willing to adequately fund the group.  "The Tories have gotten lots of mileage  out of us. They're always holding us up as an  example of how wonderful they are. They  "Disabled women are  the canaries of the  women's movement and  the closure of our  national office shows  what a profound effect  cutbacks are having on I  women's groups."     |  -Pat Israel, DAWN    I  know how much money it takes to run an  organization like this. They know what  they're doing," she says.  Meister says that for a long time DAWN  was based in her bedroom because there  were no funds for an office.  "Hundredsand thousands of voluntary  hours have gone into DAWN already...The  government doesn't appreciate what a deal  they're getting. They're just assuming  DAWN will make do with whatever money  it gets," she says.  But Israel says they cannot run DAWN  like that anymore. "I hope they don't think  we're bluffing, because we're not," Israel  adds. "We simply cannot continue with an  impossible situation. It would take time and  money that we simply don't have. It would  be a half-assed job, and we're not willing to  do that."  She explains that even the cost of a  meeting is beyond their means. Their last  phone bill for a conference call board meeting was $1,400. "Getting the board together  in one room would have cost much, much  more," she says.  While this funding cut does not directly  affect local chapters of DAWN, which are,  for the most part, provincially funded, it will  seriously affect their work, as they rely on  the national office as the centre of their crosscountry network.  DAWN Canada is still hoping that, with  support from women's groups and indi-  vidualsand enough media attention, SecState  will reverse its position.  DAWN is asking women to phone, fax,  or write in protest to Ottawa. Letters can be  sent to: Monique Landry, Minister of Secretary of State, House of Commons, Ottawa,  Ontario, KlA 0M5. Her phone number is  (819) 997-7788 and her fax number is (819)  994-5987.  Susan Briscoe is a volunteer writer for  Kinesis, who is leaving Vancouver for  Montreal to have a baby and "forget" about  SecState for a while.  APRIL 1993 News  Lesbian rights:  Loss, win or draw  by Shannon e. Ash  It's a loss, but it's the closest lesbians  have come to winning. "It" is a recent decision by the Supreme Court of Cana da on the  Mossop case, which impacts on lesbian and  gay rights, and it has left many in lesbian and  feminist circles with mixed feelings.  Whatever the verdict, now that a decision has been made on the case of Brian  Mossop—a gay man who claimed discrimination on the basis of family status—at least  one of a number of similar cases can proceed.  Vancouver resident Carol Nielson began her human rights case three years ago  when her employer refused to allow dental  insurance coverage—part of Nielson's employment benefits—for her female partner  and the biological daughter of her partner.  Efforts to resolve the situation were  unsuccessful, so she filed a complaint under  the Canadian Human Rights Act. She claimed  discrimination on four grounds: sex, marital  status, family status, and sexual orientation.  The Women's Legal Education and Action  Fund (LEAF) is supporting Nielson's case.  The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) has the power to recommend  the appointment of a tribunal in Nielson's  case. However, the CHRC refused to determine whether to appoint a tribunal or not,  pending the outcome of the Mossop litigation.  Nielson's lawyer, Gwen Brodsky, and  LEAF argue that the Mossop situation is  "substantively different" from Nielson's,and  Nielson's case would not necessarily be decided in the same way. However, a federal  court judge upheld the CHRC's decision,  and Nielson's case has been held in abeyance for two years.  On February 25, the Supreme Court of  Canada finally ruled on Mossop's case.  Mossop, an employee of the federal government, was denied bereavement leave to attend the funeral of his male partner's father  in 1985. He filed a complaint with the CHRC,  and a tribunal ruled in Mossop's favour.  The Attorney-General—minister of justice Kim Campbell—appealed the ruling to  the federal court of appeal and won. The  CHRC appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court ruled against  Mossop's appeal by a slim 4-3 majority. The  majority decision, delivered by Chief Justice  Lamer, is based on technical reasoning—  specifically, on what was judged to be the  intent of Parliament at the time the case  began.  Parliament had amended the Human  Rights Act in 1983 to include family status,  but sexual orientation was not listed as a  prohibited ground for discrimination. Therefore, Lamer writes, Parliament did not intend to include lesbians and gays under the  definition of family status and, therefore,  Mossop's claim was not valid at the time it  was filed.  While the Supreme Court judgement is  based on old law and not current judgements and events, the court decision gives a  nod to developments on the lesbian and gay  rights front that have occurred in the time  since they heard Mossop's case.  These include an Ontario Court of Appeal ruling on Haig last year. The ruling  drew on the equality section in the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms to say that courts are  required to "read in" sexual orientation as  protected grounds under human rights acts.  Also, in December last year, former justice minister Kim Campbell introduced  amendments to the Human Rights Act which,  while including sexual orientation as protected grounds, limited the definition of  marital status to heterosexual couples. The  amendments drew criticism from gay and  lesbian rights activists and have since been  shelved, at least for the time being.  The Supreme Court decision notes that  the situation might have been different had  Mossop's lawyers launched a Charter challenge of the law's consti tutionality. They say  they had to rely on parliamentary intent  because a Charter challenge was not made.  However, the dissenting judgement,  delivered byJusticeClaireL'Heureux-Dube,  supports a more liberal interpretation of  human rights legislation: "Concepts of equality and liberty which appear in human rights  documents are not bounded by the precise  understanding of those who drafted them."  Furthermore, "the traditional conception of family is not the only conception., .the  law has evolved and continues to evolve to  recognize an increasingly broad range of  relationships... Given the range of human  preferences and possibilities, it is not unreasonable to conclude that families may take  many forms."  Following the decision on Mossop,  Brodsky sent a letter to the CHRC to request  Nielson's case now be allowed to proceed.  As we go to press with this story, the commission still hasn't responded.

"It skirted the main issue, which is  whether or not lesbians and gays can have  families," she says.  But her lawyer, Brodsky, sees some  positive signs in the Supreme Court decision. She notes that none of the judges found  the behaviour of the government appropriate, and they ruled against Mossop by a slim  majority on a highly technical ground. Only  the minority judges ruled on the substantive  issues, and they ruled in favour of lesbians  and gays.  Brodsky notes that Nielson's case is significantly different from Mossop's case in  that it is more comprehensive—claiming four  grounds of discrimination and addressing  the dynamic between sex and sexual orientation. It also raises a different set of facts,  such as the parent-child relationship.  "The case provides the opportunity to  advance evidence and arguments regarding  the unique circumstances of women who  are lesbians," says Brodsky. The issues being raised are not necessarily the same as  those for gay men, she adds.  Lesbians, more than gay men, have particular equality concerns arising from their  lower economic status and the fact that les  bians are more likely to be caring for children than gay men.  Under grounds of sex discrimination,  one issue is freedom of choice in relationships. Brodsky argues this is central to the  goal of equality for all women, and includes  freedom from compulsory heterosexuality.  Nielsen will go ahead with all four  grounds in her case, although she fears the  CHRC may choose not to look at family  status in the wake of the Mossop decision,  while marital status may be threatened by  Campbell's proposed human rights act  amendments.  One major difference she sees between  Mossop's case and her own is that children  are involved. The fact that she and her partner are two women with a dependent child  may cause their case to be looked at differently than that of two men with no  dependents. Although this may have a good  effect—children are often seen as reinforcing a family—"it would be bad if those  lesbian and gay couples without children  are deemed not family. But any victory we  can get is worth pursuing," she says.  Shannon e. Ash is a lesbian with no  employment benefits—and not much (paid)  employment either. She thanks Agnes  Huang for her help with the material for  this story.  Moge vs Moge after divorce:  A better break  by Lissa Geller  A recent court decision recognizing the  sexist division of labour for women within  marriage may give divorced women who  are dependent on spousal support payments  a better break, says a women's legal group.  Helena Orton of the Women's Legal  Education and Action Fund (LEAF) says the  Supreme Court decision on Moge versus  Moge recognizes "that it is primarily women  who are economically disadvantaged during marriage and its breakdown, because  generally it is women who take primary  responsibility for childcare and other household work at the expense of their employment opportunities." LEAF intervened in  the case because of "its critical importance  for women."  Following 18 years of marriage, during  which Mrs. Moge worked part-time as a  cleaner in the evenings and looked after her  three children in the daytime, the couple  divorced. Mr. Moge was ordered by a Manitoba court to pay $150 a month in spousal  support as well as child support for the  couple's three children. After the separation  in 1973, Mrs. Moge took a full-time job as a  cleaner. She is 55, speaks little English, has a  grade 7 education, and has suffered disabling injuries.  The case was brought to the Supreme  Court when Mr. Moge's attempts to end his  spousal support obligations on the grounds  that his ex-wife had ample time to gain  financial self-sufficiency were turned down  by a Manitoba court.  The Supreme Court upheld the Manitoba ruling and said Mr. Moge must continue to pay his wife spousal benefits. The  majority decision is a significant move away  from the courts' traditional emphasis on  awarding support on a "sink or swim" basis  and sets a legal precedent for courts to take  into consideration women's economic inequality following divorce.  Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dube writes  in the majority decision that "judges must be  more aware of the social reality of divorce—  that women almost always emerge as the  poorer partner."  Orton concludes that the decision  "should be helpful in making the legal system and spousal support awards more accessible and responsive to women."  In its intervention, LEAF argued that  the continued gender-based division of labour means that women often leave a marriage with less opportunities for outside  employment and more responsibilities for  home and children. This translates into  economic hardship for women and their  children.  The Supreme Court decision accepts  that argument. "There is no doubt that divorce and its economic effects are playing a  role in the feminization of poverty..." writes  L'Heureux-Dube. She cites a 1988 study that  shows two-thirds of divorced women have  incomes below the poverty line compared  with only ten percent of divorced men.  In addition to recognizing the poverty  faced by many women when leaving the  marriage, the Court also stressed the need  for support well after the divorce.  According to Orton, the Court said " long  term support or its equivalent is often necessary due to the broad scope and long term  nature of women's economic disadvantages."

News  Circling Dawn:  Posters  strike nerve  by Jackie Brown  Last month, posters warning women to  beware of Circling Dawn and calling for a  boycott of the organic food store and restaurant appeared on Commercial Drive in Vancouver. Describing the store as "dangerous"  to women, the posters accuse Circling Dawn  of widespread economic and sexual exploitation and abuse.  The posters say several women have  been raped by members of the Circling Dawn  collective and others associated with the  store, and that women have been forced to  take part in circle discussions of the sexual  assaults with their abusers present.  Other accusations include: that Circling  Dawn has conned women out of thousands  of dollars; pressures staff to work long hours  and for food, not money; is anti-choice; discourages the use of birth control; and advocates polygamy.  Circling Dawn responded to the charges  with its own poster entitled, "From the  Women of Circling Dawn," denying the allegations. The poster claims that the accusations of rape are unsubstantiated. "To the  best of our knowledge, no woman has ever  been raped by any collective members."  It asks the people involved in the  postering campaign "to come forward with  the names of the rapists and any specific  substantiating information or to contact the  appropriate authorities."  Circling Dawn says no-one has talked  to them personally about any of the charges,  including the rapes. Spokesperson Mojave  says that, while they believe women who  say they have been sexually abused, in this  case no woman has approached the collective with their stories.  But women working with survivors of  rape say that asking women to come forward and name their rapists does not acknowledge women's fear of retaliation, or  their right to decide how they will deal with  an abuser. "No one should expect any  woman to confront her rapist under any  circumstances," says Sarah Leavitt of Women Against Violence Against Women  (WAVAW.)  Immigration and Refugee Board:  Rules count  women in  by Smita Patil  Women may beeligible to stay inCanada  if they are fleeing countries where the government "is unwilling or unable" to protect  them from sexual or domestic violence, according to new Immigration and Refugee  Board (IRB) guidelines ongender-based persecution.  The guidelines came after intense pressure from women's organisations, which  have supported severa 1 cases of women refugees fighting deportation.  Eighty percent of the world's refugees  are women, yet two-thirds of refugee claimants accepted into Canada are men. The IRB  guidelines broaden the interpretationof refugee to include gender-based persecution.  Neither Canadian Immigration law nor  the United Nations Convention on Refugees, on which the law is based, include  gender as a grounds of persecution.  Under the guidelines, a refugee claimant is required to convince the IRB officer  that a policy or law in her home country is  inherently persecutory towards women, that  she fears how the law is administered, and  that punishment for non-compliance is persecution.  There is also no requirement that the  guidelines be followed by IRB officers, and  interpretation, for example, of "domestic  violence" will be left to their discretion. (IRB  officers are federal patronage appointments  rather than career officers hired for their  skills and, while they are accountable to a  federal court, their decisions can only be  appealed on the narrowest legal grounds).  "The guidelines are just that—guidelines," says Beverly Bain of the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women  (NAC). "Itis important thatgender persecution be part of the legal definition [of a  refugee]. It should not be left up to the  discretion of IRB officers," she says.  Bain says NAC, refugee and other women's groups are pushing the government to  go further and change the Immigration law.  "There is no need to sit down and debate  with them whether gender persecution should  be grounds for refugee claims, but consultations should be liad on how it should be legislated," she says. "We just have to push them  to make it law."  Minister of immigration, Bernard  Valcourt, has said that extension of the Immigration law to include gender-based persecution is unlikely. His reasons include:  Canada should not be imposing its values on  other countries; Canada cannot afford to  take the flood of women claimants that would  follow; and, it is up to the United Nations,  not Canada, to broaden the definition of  refugee.  In the meantime, NAC is demanding a  moratorium on deportations of women survivors of violence or sexist persecution until  the law is changed.  "It's not fair to deport these women to  possible death and certain violence when  we've changed the IRB guidelines," said  NAC's Judy Rebick. She says the IRB should  review the women's cases based on the new  guidelines.  However, while Valcourt has granted  temporary stays of deportation orders in  several cases, he says a moratorium is out of  the question.

Smita Patil is a volunteer writer for  Kinesis.  ...women working with  survivors of rape say  that asking women to  come forward and name  their rapists does not  acknowledge women's  fear of retaliation...  Kinesis spoke to some women who say  they have experienced various forms of abuse  at Circling Dawn, but they have requested  that no details of their stories be revealed in  any context at this time. The women say they  been through a great deal of emotional pain  and stress, and fear repercussions if they are  identified.  Otherwomen,notdirectlyinvolvedwith  Circling Dawn, but associated with the boycott action/agreed to speak on condition of  anonymity or on a first-name basis.  The poster action came out of a series of  meetings that began in February. A large  number of women showed up for the first  meeting. Some were former Circling Dawn  members, others were friends of women  who had been involved, and others had  heard stories and were concerned about Circling Dawn's treatment of women in particular.  The women decided on an anonymous  poster campaign to alert other women to  what had happened to some women associated with the Circling Dawn community.  The women say they felt this might be the  best vehicle, since women were not ready to  publicly confront Circling Dawn.  Public responsewasimmediateand supportive. The women say more women who  had survived abusive involvements with  Circling Dawn came forward with similar  stories.  Stephanie—one of the women who put  up the "Beware of Circling Dawn" posters—  says she and other women have decided to  break anonymity and come forward to stop  the targeting of individual women.  She told Kinesis the accusations are based  on "first-hand accounts of abuse. The information [for the accusations] was given either by a woman or women to whom it  happened, both in person and in writing."  According to Stephanie, women who  attended the meetings talked of the pressure, coercion and sexual assault of women  involved with Circling Dawn. Store owner  Tom Evans was described as a "powerful  leader" who used rhetoric to manipulate  and dominate members of the group.  Since the postering action, some women  say they, as well as friends and supporters  not involved in the action, have been harassed and intimidated.  One Black woman says she was confronted at a Black History Month event by  three women from Circling Dawn. She says  she then confronted the women after the  event. A couple of weeks later, she said, a  woman of colour who had supported her  during the Black History month confrontations received a threatening message on her  answering machine.  And, she says, two other friends, also  women of colour, were confronted by men  from the Circling Dawn community a few  days after the Lesbian Visibility March, during which a group of women of colour  shouted, "Circling Dawn is racist scum."  Hopi, a spokesperson for Circling Dawn,  acknowledges tha t she and two other women  from Circling Dawn individually approached a woman they had been told was  involved in the postering at a Black History  month event, to talk about the postering.  Things got heated, she says, and they  dropped it. Another conversation took place  after the event during which, Hopi says, the  Black woman and her friends accused Hopi  and the other Circling Dawn women of harassment.  Two women involved in the postering  campaign—Wilma and Emily [not their real  names]—also say they have been harassed.  They say they have been followed and their  home has been watched since their involvement in the postering campaign.  "We're outraged at the attempts to silence us. We speak about the violence that  happened to us, and harassment is the response," says Emily. They say they initially  joined the campaign because they had been  verbally and physically abused by two men  from Circling Dawn.  Emily and Wilma have filed a. formal  complaint regarding the harassment with  police.  Hopi insists no one in the collective has  "followed or harassed anyone."  Meanwhile, the women involved in the  boycott say they are concerned that women  are being set up against each other. The  women of Circling Dawn have been responsible for defending the store.  "By speaking as the only organized  voice, the women of Circling Dawn are bearing the brunt of criticism and this can too  easily be deflected into a pitting of women  against women," say Emily and Wilma. "Either way, one group of women must be  lying."  Bonnie Agnew of Rape Relief says she is  concerned that men at Circling Dawn are  abdicating their responsibility. "I'd like to  hear the men make some honest statements,"  says Agnew. "If there is this much anger,  then I know from experience there is something to it, and it seems like the men are  getting out of the public heat. And it's the  women and the kids who are in economic  jeopardy."  Meanwhile, the women at Circling  Dawn say there is a need for an open meeting between all concerned with a professional facilitator. "We've sought this with  them several times and they've blocked it  every time," says Hopi.  The women acknowledge that they've  been asked to step forward, but say they  believe it's their prerogative to decide how  to deal with their concerns about Circling  Dawn. "If we don't feel safe, we don't," says  Wilma.  In the meantime, WAVAW has sent a  press release to local media saying,  "WAVAW believes all women who say they  have been sexuallyassaulted...We know that  a woman who is sexually assaulted is usually faced with disbelief from the police,  doctors or family and friends."  WAVAW says its policy is to "disclose  no information that would identify women  who call our line. "We refuse to say whether  or not women have called our line about  assaults at Circling Dawn."

The conference, called "A Step Behind—  Who Is There?", will be structured to reflect  a three level analysis of issues of men stalking women as follows: the nature of the  problem and its extent, current responses by  the system, solutions and strategies.  The conference will be held in the Begbie  Building at the University of Victoria, May  14 and 15. For more information, call SWAG  at (604) 381-1012.  Alternative healing  for survivors  VISAC, The Vancouver Incest and  Sexual Abuse Centre has started a committee to address the issues of: creating an alternative to a psychiatric ward for treatment of  adult survivors who need a safe place to heal  from the trauma of sexual abuse; and to  implement a concept of residential treatment centres as an alternative to hospitalization and the high cost of hospital care. This  will provide services that are desperately  needed by survivors and are presently not  available in this province, and will save  money.  The first committee meeting was held in  March. If you're interested in becoming involved with this committee call Lyn Martens  atVTSAC874-2938.Address:1193Kingsway,  Vancouver.  A healthy voice  for all women  The provincial government ha s rejected  a proposal by the Vancouver Women's Health  Collective (VWHC) whichdemanded a voice  for all women in the restructuring of health  care inBC.  The VWHC's brief proposed government fund a representative group of women  to canvass opinions on how the restructur  ing should take place to ensure v  health. The VWHC stress it is necessary for  a broad spectrum of women, not just the  privileged, to have input into the process.  The Provincial Women's Health Lobby,  which supported the VWHC initiative, is a  group of women dedicated to developing a  platform from which all women can speak  about health care issues. The Health Lobby  believes public consultation must be educational about the impact public policy on  women's health has on each woman's life.  Women can then make educated choices  about what a public policy on women's  health should be.  PWHL is urging women to send letters  in support of a public consultation process,  by April 1, to: Elizabeth Cull, Minister of  Health, Rm. 310, Parliament Buildings, Victoria, BC, V8V 1X4; and to: Penny Priddy,  Minister for Women's Equality, Rm. 342,  Parliament Buildings, Victoria, BC, V8V1X4.  Economic theory  and feminism  Mainstream economic theories have  tended to exclude women. A group of  women economists in The Netherlands are  planning a conference to "contribute to the  development of a more gender balanced  economic theory."  "Out of the Margin: Feminist Perspectives on Economic Theory" will be held in  Amsterdam, June 2 to 5,1993 and will be the  first conference of its kind in Europe. It will  include public debates and a large 'Ideas  Exchange Market,' as well as the closed scientific session where participation would be  limited. Early registration is advised.

Fourth women's  world conference  The United Nations Commission on the  Status of Women will hold the fourth in its  series of world conferences in Beijing, China,  September 4 to 15, 1995. Previous conferences were held in 1975,1980 and 1985. The  1985 NGO conference in Nairobi, Kenya,  drew 13,000 women from around the world.  The mandate of "The Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace" is to define a platform  of action for the commission. The commission says this platform will be concise and  action-oriented, and will concentrate on a  few issues identified as representing fundamental obstacles to the advancement of the  majority of women in the world. It would  include elements related to awareness-  raising, decision-making, literacy, poverty,  health, violence, national machinery, refugees, and technology.  A non-governmental organization  (NGO) forum will be organized parallel to  the Fourth World Conference. The commission will attempt to foster close cooperation  between the United Nations system, governments and NGOs during the preparatory  process leading up to the conferences.  The commission says it recognizes the  importance of the extensive contribution of  non-governmental organizations to the success of previous world conferences on  women. The commission also will attempt  to promote the participation of Third World  NGOs.  Handbook on  sexual assault  A new, comprehensive handbook on  sexual assault has just been published by the  Montreal Health Press.  The book, Sexual Assault, is divided into  two sections. The first is a guide to preventing, fighting and dealing with sexual assaults. The second is an analysis of the social  context of sexual assault.  Sexual Assault provides definitions of  different kinds of sexual assault, and information designed to help those who have  been sexually assaulted decide whether to  report the assault to the police. It also explains both the progressive and regressive  aspects of Canada's new sexual assault law,  passed in June 1992.  Sexual Assault is available from Montreal Health Press, Inc., CP 1000, Station  Place du Pare, Montreal, P.Q., H2W 2N1.  Cost is $4 for a single copy; bulk discounts  are available. It is available in French or  English.

What's News  by Lynne Wanyeki  NDP and unions  agree on health  Almost five thousand hospital employees will lose their jobs under a deal negotiated between BC's three health care unions  and the provincial government last month.  The deal guarantees job security, a  shorter work week, and a greater role in  hospital decision-making.  Under the deal, hospital employees,  most of whom are women, will be transferred to community health care facilities.  The promise of transferral stemmed from  union fears of job losses under the provincial  government's planned re-structuring of the  BC health care system.  The provincial government, acting on  recommendations in the 1991 Royal Commission on Health Care, aims to make health  care more community-oriented. There-structuring plans include the establishment of  100 regional councils to set health care priorities, as well as increased funding to community health care facilities. The increased  funding will allow for the hiring of hospital  employees whose jobs are being cut in the  process of re-structuring.  The deal "means that our people can  move with the switch from acute care to  community care," says Carmela Allevato of  the Hospital Employees Union.  "The traditional way to close hospital  beds has been wholesale layoffs and service  cuts. The agreement really provides us with  an opportunity in BC to ensure that the  switch to community health care is progressive rather than regressive and oppressive."  The deal was negotiated by the Hospital  Employees Union, the BC Nurses Union and  the Health Sciences Association. It must still  be ratified by the union members and the  province hospitals.  Child care  council formed  Early in February, Penny Priddy, BC  Women's Equality Minister announced the  appointment of a 17-member Provincial  Child Care Council. The Council is intended  to give communities input into childcare in  BC.  The formation of the Council is part of  the NDP initiative on childcare announced  by Priddy at the conference on childcare  held in Vancouver in April last year. The  NDP initiative is a 5-year plan, which does  not address the immediate, critical lack of  child care spaces in BC.  "Despite the best efforts of municipalities and the provincial government, the cri-  sishas grown because of federal cuts in some  basic programs that aided families," says  Penny Coates. Coates is the civic child care  coordinator for the City of Vancouver.  "Vancouver has just 4500 day care spaces  and needs a minimum of 11000 more just to  cope with basic needs of residents," Coates  stated early this month.  "The situation provincially is no better,  with statistics showing 280,000 children needing child care and only about 28,000 spaces  existing," said Peter Ashmore of the West  Coast Childcare Resource Centre.  TheCouncil'smandatewill include giving advice to the provincial government on  the development and evaluation of child  care programs, as well as establishing links  FEATURI NG...

Review of  adoption laws  A review of the 36-year old adoption  law in BC is being reviewed to reflect changing social values around adoption, says BC's  Minister of Social Services.  The government's review of the Adoption Act will include consultation with communities and organizations that have indicated a wish to see the legislation change.  Changes to the Adoption Act were recommended by the Community Panel Report  into Family and Child Services, which was  received by the provincial government in  December 1992.  Some of the ideas up for discussion  during the review are the regulation of private adoptions, and allowing a continuing  bond between the adopted child and the  birth family. So far, no mention has been  made of adoptions by lesbian or gay families.  The review is expected to be completed  by November of this year. For more information, call 1-800-663-1251.  Ten bucks more  for welfare recipients  Effective February 1, social assistance  rates have been increased minimally in BC.  The increase, made by the provincial  NDP government, gives single employable  people as well as single "unemployable"  people $10/month more. Single parents  with one child also get $17/month more.  The increase amounts to less than 2  percent of the old social assistance rates.  This means that people receiving social assistance will remain below the poverty line.  However, the increase has been slated  for the support portion of the social assistance cheques, rather than the shelter portion. This means that everyone receiving  social assistance will be eligible to receive  the money, regardless of whether or not  their rent necessitates it.  Effective April 1, the minimum wage  will also be increased to $6/hour. But, says  a spokesperson at End Legislated Poverty,  the minimum wage has to go up to at least  $9.05/hour in order for it to have the same  value it had in 1975.   call us  cheap ads!  255*5499  1716 Charles St Vancouver BC VSL2TS 3& (604)253-3142  smoke fice cappuccino bar    (Jf   light vegetarian meals  <§■ art&crafts   <£ gifts&music £   pooltablc  Open Tuesday ■* Sunday  Womyn's Open Stage       Qh  Saturday, April 24th      ^  Book your Special Event with Us  Also effective April 1 is an increased  wage for live-in domestic workers.

Maiya house  workers on strike  Newly unionized workers at Maiya  House in Nanaimo voted 90 percent in favour of taking strike action in mid-March.  Maiya House is one of only two residential  treatment programs in BC run exclusively  for chemically-dependent women.  The union is seeking a decrease in work  hours and an increase in wages to bring their  wages to the same level as union staff at both  the Columbia House in Nanaimo and the  ADAPT drug and alcohol program in Victoria.  The 13 women who work at Maiya  House joined the Health Sciences Association in June last year. At that time, working  conditions included 51 -hour weeks, with no  overtime and salaries of $1750/month.  Since that time, they have been trying to  negotiate an agreement with their employer,  Maiya House Society.  The Society, which receives funding  through the BC Ministry of Hea lth's Alcohol  and Drug Programs, has offered wage increases which would leave the Maiya House  workers from 9 percent to 44 percent behind  workers doing substantially the same kind  of work. Its last offer was rejected five days  before the strike began.  Pro-choicers call  for more security  Abortionclinics throughout the US have  tightened their securityand women's groups  are urging Congress to approve legislation  making the blocking of abortion clinics a  federal crime. At the same time, many groups  are pushing for an FBI investigation of "anti-  choice violence."  These moves come after investigators  found no evidence of conspiracy in the shooting death of a doctor outside his abortion  clinic in Florida.  "This is clearly not an isolated act by one  crazy individual," says Joy Thompson of the  BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics. "The  anti-choice movement has not been able to  win legislation and is now resorting to terrorism."  The US shooting "is religious intolerance to the nth degree," stated Dr. Mary  Conley, a Victoria physician who is a member of Physicians for Choice. "For years,  we've been saying that pro-life is not pro-  life, it is anti-choice. This particular case  certainly brings it out."  Pro-choice activists in BC feel that the  violent tactics of the US anti-abortionists are  spreading into Canada. There has been an  increase in harassment against BC doctors  who perform abortion. The harassment  ranges from picketing to threats, at doctors'  homes as well as their workplaces.  The BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics  currently has a survey underway to determine the extent of harassment experienced  by doctors who perform abortions in BC.  1988 W 4th & Maple  Vancouver, B.C.  V6J 1M5  733-3511  APRIL 1993 Feature  NAFTA:  Mexican women say no  by Patricia Hume  translated by Gabriella Moro  These are excerpts of presentations made  before a crowd of about 900 at a public forum in  Vancouver on the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) last month. The forum  was co-sponsored by the Action Canada Network, the National Action Committee on the  Status ofWomen (NAC)andthe Vancouver and  Dis trict Labour Cou ncil and Trade Un ion group.  Everybody who has concerns about  NAFTA knows that it has a lot of implications and not only in the area of trade. It's  impact will be felt in our daily lives. One of  the most serious problems is that this trade  agreement has no limits, neither social ones,  nor to do with the environment. In the social  area, it is anti-democratic.  improving the quality of life for people, and  even less to take care of the environment.  The only thing they're really interested in is  obtaining maximum profits with maximum  productivity, and giving back in exchange  the minimum—minimum salaries—and nothing, in terms of the environment.  In my country, 20 years ago, the  transnationals installed themselves in the  industrial parts of the state of Morales, where  I live. They are mostly pharmaceuticals, like  DuPont. The working conditions for the people include minimum safety standards or  security, and people working there are exposed to toxic substances like hormones.  There are chronic illnesses because of  the workplace. For example, there are problems in women's reproductive systems, spontaneous abortions, sterility in some of the  For us, it has been really really difficult  to even know what kinds of terms have been  negotiated in this agreement. The government has not taken the time to inform the  population. So what we had to do really was  kind of work as "spies" in order to figure out  how this treaty is going to affect us.  Unfortunately, what we found has told  us we have really run into some tough times.  There are other treaties that are affected by  NAFTA, for example, really important environmental treaties like the ones we negotiated and signed at the Earth Summit in Rio  de Janiero. We signed them because humanity is in danger. There are a number of  international conventions and agreements  that address for example, climate change.  All of this is in order to achieve the  objective—that this planet continues to be  habitable for future generations. But for this,  we need sustainable development and  NAFTA is totally against this kind of development. This is because NAFTA's philosophy is to take whatever transnationals want  with no limits, whether it's in the workforce  or in natural resources.  Because what the transnationals are interested in is not the well-being of people nor  men, and more and more children are being  born all the time with genetic problems—  there have been recent cases of children  being born without a brain.  It's a very serious problem that neither  the government nor the transnationals will  face up to. What they say to the workers is,  "it's your personal problem and this has got  nothing to do with the workplace."  The state of the environment has also  deteriorated. The water is so polluted with  heavy metals, that for a year and a half now,  the peasants are prohibited from planting  seeds, especially rice that they used to grow,  which was of the best quality. This was rice  for export in addition to the cultivation and  gardens and corn for local use.  Right now, the peasants are without  work, without food, because what they used  to grow helped them sustain a better quality  of life.  At least they could eat the corn and  beans they grew in their own property and  their own land and at least survive the low  salaries they were getting.  But now, they are not allowed to plant  seeds. And the government, instead of blaming the transnationals, blames the peasants  All natural ingredients  Hot Cross Buns  available through Easter  1697 Venables at Commercial 254-5635  Mon-Fri 8am-5:30pm Sat 9am-5:30pm  as told to Ellen Woodsworth  Kinesis got the chance to talk to Patricia  Humeforafew minutes after her presentation at  the NAFTA forum.  Ellen Woodsworth: Why are women in  Mexico City fighting against the free trade  agreement?  Patricia Hume: Because NAFTA is  against women's rights and women's daily  life. When the price of food goes up, you  have to find other ways of finding food, and  it's always the women's work. I mean, you  don't have to work for an hour like before.  You have to work four hours in order to have  food for your family.  Andit'sthesamewithhealth—you don't  have health services. You have to do it yourself. Women have all the burden of health  and food and other responsibilities of the  whole family. So women are the poorest of  the poor.  Woodsworth: Women in Canada and in  the US are afraid of fighting against the free  trade agreement because they think it will  mean they are fighting against Mexican  women.  Hume: That's why we're here. Because  women in Canada really don't know the  conditions of Mexican women. The conditions here are a lotbetterand Mexican women  are in much worse conditions. We want you  to fight the free trade agreement with us.  Woodsworth: What's been happening to  human rights, say, for gay people, for immigrants, for Mexican people, for indigenous  people?  Hume: I belong to a network for human  rights. Every day in my state, people disappear, women get raped, or they poison your  water so no one knows you're being poisoned. But it's especially bad for indigenous  people, they are charged for being on drugs,  for dealing...and they have nothing to do  with drugs.  And because most of them don't speak  the language—in Mexico, we have more  than 100 dialects—they can't defend them-  and say they are irresponsible because they  continue to try and plant seeds in these  conditions.  So the peasants are forced to sell their  land. The government changed the law that  forbid the sale of communal land so the  peasants now sell their land.  The campasinos [farmers] go to work in  factories where there are really bad conditions, in terms of nutrition, health and so on.  All of this has happened before the implementation of the North AmericanFreeTrade  Agreement. These transnationals have  shown us they're not going to be nice with  us.  So what do you think is going to happen  with the signing of the agreement? We're  definitely opposed to this agreement. We  don't-want them to sign parallel or sidebar  agreements either.  What we want is a democratic process  in order to have trade agreements that are  equitable, that seek an acceptable quality of  life for people that comes before the profit  motive, and that speaks out for sustainable  development.  To achieve this, we are trying to establish a network of citizens, because we know  that this agreement is not good for us, not for  the Mexicans and not for the Americans and  not for the Canadians.  What we have to do is unite, and form a  social force that takes back the power of the  people, that takes back the power of local  governments and that comes before this trade  agreement—an agreement that is against  things like equality and freedom. We have to  work together even beyond the agreement.  Canadians should do something to oppose  this thing just as we, in Mexico, are trying to  do.  mmemmim  Patricia Hume is a Mexican biologist and  environmentalist who has spent the last few  years working with the Indigenous people of  Mexico.  ...NAFTA is against  women's rights and  women's daily life.  -Patricia Hume  mm**************  selves. And because the communication system is so bad, nobody knows when you just  disappear, or are shot. Other people take  their land and nobody knows. There's just  silence.  Woodsworth: In Canada, Aboriginal peoples are fighting with the provincial governments to have recognition that they never  signed the lands over to the i mperialist powers. Now, with the free trade agreement,  they will lose many of freedoms that have  been fought for. The commission under the  NAFTA agreement will physically remove  these things. Has something like that happen to the communal land in Mexico?  Hume: Yes. One of the things was that  the campasinos could have their own land, a  communal land. And nobody could have  it—people would come and give you a lot of  money, but it was not allowed to sell the  land. Now, the government has changed the  law so that campasinos can sell the land. It is  not that they want to sell, but they have been  forced to sell—like I said, if the land is  polluted, we cannot use the land. So now  campasinos go to the cities to work for very  low wages, and they have to pa y for the land,  so they'd rather sell it.  And all these big realtors come and buy  the land for peanuts. They give them nothing. So the campasinos are left without a  land. The realtors make tourist resorts, and  hordes of people come. And after the  campasinos have been forced to sell for nothing, they are put to work in the hotels, made  to live in houses with no water and no  electricity. They're not allowed to fish any  more.  Woodsworth: What's happening in terms  of women mobilizing against the NAFTA?  Hume: In the cities, where women are  more aware, we're building women's  groups. Outside the cities, it's more difficult.  The campasinos don't talk about NAFTA as  much as they talk about human rights. And  the women think it's natural for them to be  where they are—that god made them be  there, that you have to be born into a place  where you are more wealthy, like white  people.  What also makes it difficult is the ecologist perspective in the cities is against the  indigenous perspective. Ecologists say "save  the land! Save the land!" But they don't  realize that a lot of indigenous people live on  that land. We're now working together to  find, to invent, to make up ways of thinking Feature  Abortion in Ireland:  Dialing for  pro-choice  by Erin Mullan  In a small, unheated room somewhere  in central Dublin, a woman unlocks a cupboard and pulls out a telephone. It's 7 pm  and time for the Women's Information Network to go into operation. For the next two  hours, the phone won't stop ringing, as  women from all over Ireland call to get  abortion information.  The location of the helpline is a well-  kept secret, known only to the members of  the Women's Information Network. Giving  women information about abortion and the  telephone numbers of abortion clinics in  Britain, was until very recently illegal in  Ireland. Any information about abortion is  hard to come by in the 26 counties making  up the Irish republic. (Abortion information  is easier to come by in the north of Ireland,  although, like in the south, abortion itself is  illegal.)  Following the passage of an anti-abortion constitutional referendum in 1983, Irish  anti-choice groups, like the Society for the  Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC), have  used the courts to shut down any counselling service that provides non-directive pregnancy counselling, which included abortion  information as an option. (Non-directive  counselling is counselling that does not tell  the client what to do, but helps her to make  the choice that she wants.)  Abortion information went underground. A group of feminists set up the  Women's Information Network (WIN) in  the aftermath of the court injunctions  against the counselling services. The injunctions didn't stop Irish women from travelling to Britain to have abortions, but they did  make it very difficult to get information  before they went.  Imagine yourself faced with an unplanned pregnancy, forced to travel by boat  or plane to another country, often for the  first time, and making that journey with no  information about what services are available when you arrive. Most of the thousands  of Irish women who go to Britain for abortions each year travel with no information,  and they often have to hide the reason for  their trip from family and friends.  In Canada, there is also a great deal of  silence surrounding the issue of abortion.  Most women regard the decision to have an  abortion as something private and personal,  partly because it is a very personal matter,  and partly because in Canada there isa small  but very vocal anti-abortion lobby. In Ireland, the anti-choice forces are far from small,  and they dominate the most powerful institutions.  The silence on abortion in Ireland was  broken by some women's groups, students  organizations and a few brave individuals.  Until the pro-choice referendum victories at  the end of last year [see Kinesis, Feb. 93] these  people made up the underground movement that tried to keep abortion information  available in Ireland, in spite of the threat of  heavy fines being imposed by the courts.  Last year, when I was travelling in rural  Ireland, the first place I saw the WIN phone  number was on the wall of a toilet stall in a  pub in Donegal. This is not unusual. WIN  statistics show that, in addition to information from friends and student handbooks,  stickers put in pub toilets and other public  places are the main ways women get the  helpline phone number. June Kelly, a WIN  member, says the helpline exists to help  break down the isolation Irish women feel  when faced with an unwanted pregnancy.  "We're here because of the women in,  say, Galway, bunging 50 pence pieces into  the phone box, maybe with two or three kids  banging on the door, terrified the neighbours will come by and say 'Mary, why are  you using the phone box when you've got a  phone at home?'" says Kelly.  "Often women want to talk a bit, because this is often the first time they've talked  with anyone about their situation," she says.  "We reassure women that there's nothing  illegal or backstreet about the abortion clinics in Britain. We also tell them about cheap  travel etc. We try and give them as much  information as possible so as to save women  long-distance charges when they phone the  clinic to book an appointment."  Kelly says the helpline workcanbe hard  for the volunteers because of the lack of face-  to-face contact with callers who are often  very upset. "It can be quite traumatic because we're talking through the telephone  line and, if she's in severe stress, you can't  hold her hand and say Tm not a machine,  I'm a friend and I'm not going to judge  you'."  While the majority of helpline callers  have already decided to have an abortion,  some women want help with decision-making. If the caller wants further counselling,  the volunteer can refer her to thelrishFamily  Planning Association (IFPA). As of October  1992, the IFPA has a contract with the British  Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which  is a non-profit abortion service with clinics  throughout Britain. The IFPA now provides  non-directive counselling and, when requested, referral to a BPAS clinic. Despite  the passing of a constitutional referendum  last November, which guarantees the right  to information, the referral service is still  technically illegal, according to the IFPA.  June Kelly says that while WIN faces a  constant threatof being targeted in the courts  by SPUC, so far there is no court injunction  against the helpline. She says, on several  occasions, phone volunteers have had a bad  scare when Irish policehaveactually phoned  the line, but they were in fact calling to get  information about shelters where they could  take battered women.  Most of the women who volunteer on  the helpline have a counselling or social  work background. There are about twenty  volunteers who range in age from mid-20s to  mid-40s. Kelly says they reflect a cross-section of Irish society, but they are all women's  rights campaigners. "The majority of the  women were active in the 1983 referendum  campaign and have been plodding along  "We're here because of  the women... bunging 50  pence pieces into the  phone box... terrified the  neighbor will come  by..."-June Kelly, WIN  since that time, trying to improve the position of women in this country."  Irish student organizations have also  been campaigning for women's rights, with  serious consequences. Student unions have  been publishing abortion information, including the WIN helpline number in student  handbooks  In 1989, the Society for the Protection of  the Unborn Child got a court injunction to  stop the student unions from distributing  theabortioninformation,an injunction which  the students continue to defy. SPUC has  been granted court costs to the tune of over  $40,000 each for 14 individual student leaders who were named in the court action.  Louise Tierney of Trinity Student Union in  Dublin says, if SPUC goes after the student  unions for the money, it would bankrupt  and thereby destroy the student movement  in Ireland.  Tierney and other student union members have been active in building a broad  pro-choice campaign in Ireland, as well as  providing abortion information. The Dublin  Abortion In formation Campaign is demanding access to abortion, contraception and sex  education throughout Ireland. The campaign  organized the massive pro-choice demonstrations last year that garnered headlines  worldwide, and regularly takes to the streets  to distribute abortion information like the  WIN phone number.  "The reason I think this particular campaign is important is that it's action-based.  The best way—the only way—is to talk to  people on the ground," says Tierney. "I  don't think you win campaigns through the  media or by talking to politicians because, at  the end of the day, the only thing that convinces politicians is votes or mass action—a  threat to their jobs."  One of the campaign's main action's is  to get the WIN number out to as many  womenas possible. Justdisplaying679-4700,  the helpline number, is a political act in  Ireland. Louise Tierney wears a button with  the number on it. Pro-choice campaigners  carry banners and signs and distribute leaflets, posters and stickers with the number on  them. Often they have to contend with the  always disruptive, and sometimes violent  tactics of the neo-fascist bullyboys of the  anti-choice movement who call themselves  Youth Defense. The nasty young men of  Youth Defense frequently harass pro-  choicers, sometimes picketing their homes.  They are seen on Irish streets waving grisly  full-colour posters of third trimester fetuses  and shouting abuse at anyone who challenges them.  Media coverage of pro-choice events  always carefully omits knowing the WIN  phone number, although there is no specific  injunction or legal ban against its display. As  is often the case, the Irish media self-censors  itself to a far greater extent than is legally  necessary. Media conservatism is one indicator of how much change is still needed in  Ireland.  The November abortion referendum  result was a major victory for the Irish pro-  choice movement, but the fight for reproductive rights in Ireland is far from over. The  injunctions remain against the student and  counselling organizations, and the government shows no sign of enacting legislation  which reflects the referendum results.  June Kelly says that the pro-choice  movement will continue to press for change.  "The shared wish of the WIN volunteers is  for abortion to be legalized in Ireland and  made available throughout the country.  Women should not have to be suicidal to be  provided with such a service. Officially, the  WIN is calling on the politicians to legislate  immediately for the provision of abortion  services in Ireland."  If courage and determination on the  part of pro-choicers in Ireland was all that  was needed to win reproductive freedom  for women, the fight would already be won.  Erin Mullan recently returned from Ireland  with this report.  APRIL 1993 TWD  International Women's Day:  Speaking out!  International Women's Day (March 8) was  celebrated in Vancouver on Saturday, March 6,  with a march and rally organized by the 15-year-  old IWD Committee. About 600 women took to  the streets, marchingdown to the Vancouver Art  Gallery for the rally, where women spoke on the  theme: Women and the Economy. The following  are edited transcripts of some of those speeches.  Jane Gottfriedsen  The Native Women's Association of  Canada (NWAC)  The NWAC has won its case [for Native  women's right to equal funding from the  government and a seat at future constitutional amendment talks on Native self-government], but the battle is still in front of us.  We still have to apply what we have won,  and we're doing everything that we can in  our mandate to reach these goals.  It was through your support and your  efforts that we were able to [win our case].  We did not have resources and funding  available to us. People supported us in this  manner and we were able to carry this forth  to the end.  But we've also informed the federal  government that if they do not follow with  our victory, we are prepared to sue them.  In our Provincial Territorial Member  Organizations (PMTOs) across the country,  very important struggles that lie ahead of us.  It is also a very special day for me today  because it happens to be the twentieth anniversary of the India Mahila Association.  Today marks 20 years of volunteer commitment and dedication on the part of many of  my sisters to organizing against sexism and  racism, and fighting the social, political and  economic barriers that face the women of  South Asian origin living in Canada.  Poverty...is becominga global phenomenon. We're going through some tough  times and, for the immigrant women living  in Canada, it is no different—we struggle in  our new homeland to make both ends meet  and deal with the specific issues that confront us in our daily lives.  The government of today continues to  pay lip. service to issues confronting immigrant women and women of colour. Even as  the Tories claim their commitment to improve the plight of the doubly and triply  disadvantaged, their actions have proven  the contrary. We have seen various attempts  to bring about legislation that are discriminatory and pose an impediment to the  progress of the immigrant women and the  women of colour, for example, the new  immigration act.  This act restricts immigration into  Canada under both the family sponsorship  and the refugee categories. This piece of  legislation will severely restrict the rights of  immigrants to freedom of association, to  family reunification, and take away the right  to appeal of the refugee claimants. Immigrant women of colour will be affected  very directly—their opportunities for emigrating to Canada will be reduced due to the  restrictions in the family sponsorship category, and through changes to legislation  related to domestic workers, as examples.  So, while on the one hand this government talks about wanting immigrants to  become integrated into Canadian society as  equal members of society, we continually  Anju Gogia, Burcu Ozdemir, and Nadine Chambers of the Not Just  Another Page Collective  arrival here. The allowance for childcare for  women attending LINC (Language Instruction for Newcomers) classes has also been  cut. That is making it very difficult for  women in lower-paying jobs and with childcare needs to access LINC classes.  Again, we haven't yet been able to effectively deal with the layoffs that resulted  from the Free Trade Agreement and we are  already faced with the proposed NAFTA  (North American Free Trade Agreement). If  this agreement goes through, as well as the  changes being proposed to UI benefits, we  are going to see these have a direct impact on  Miche Hill of VSW  we're all endeavouring to better the lives of  our people in the community. What we're  striving for is community-driven mandates.  What we're finding is that we have to look at  everything in a holistic manner—for our  people to be successful in economic development or in education or training, they  need to be healthy, physically and mentally.  We are striving to do all this, keeping in  mind the direction given to us from our  people at home. There are many times, when  you are in a position of leadership, that you  look back and there's no one there. So when  our elders or people reach out and encourage us and tell us we're on the right track, tell  us not to give up but to keep going, it makes  our work easier.  I thank you all.  Raminder Dosangh  India Mahila Association (IMA)  A very happy IWD to all of you that are  here and to all of my sisters who are not able  to be with us here today.  Today is a day to celebrate our achievements and make a commitment toward the  see policies being put into place that discriminate against women of colour and immigrant women. LINC, the new language  training policy announced by the federal  government last June, discriminates against  immigrant women who have acquired Canadian citizenship. Many women are paying the price for choosing to participate in  the economy, rather than being dependent  on the state during the first few years of their  lower income and more marginalized sections of our society.  I see a great need for us to unite to  develop a strategy to fight back. I also see an  urgent need for issues, such as those being  discussed here and talked about today, to be  discussed at the grassroots level amongst  the various ethnic communities. Most of the  services that exist are basically band-aid  services, providing little or no information  or empowerment to women who are isolated due to discriminatory laws, lack of  facility with the English language, or the  pressures of double or triple work loads.  Governments at all levels need to take a  serious look at the services available to the  more marginalized sections of immigrant  women, and should be enabling women's  groups to identify issues and long term planning.  Rather than cutting funds that go to the  most-needed sections of the community, the  government has to act on its promises and  provide core funding to these groups so they  can continue to define the issues from a  feminist, grassroots perspective. And only  then can we start working towards achieving equality in the true sense of the word.  And to my sisters in the broader feminist movement, I say we need to be more  inclusive, and not exclusive, when we define  women's needs and lobby on issues of concern to the women of Canada. The needs of  the women working on the farms, or of the  thousands of women with university degrees who continue to be underemployed  and work for peanuts as restaurant workers  and janitorial workers, should be of concern  to all of us and be included in our agenda.  Let us pledge to work together to make  this country a better place for all of us.  Thank you.  Miche Hill  Vancouver Status of Women (VSW)  Hello, and Happy International Women's Day to all of you! I say happy International Women's Day because that's what it's  supposed to be—a day when we are supposed to be able to celebrate our achievements, to remember the women who have  gone before us, the struggles they have  fought.  It's time to join in solidarity with our  sisters all over the world and to recognize  and celebrate the struggles that we are fighting and winning today as well.  There is a lot to celebrate, but there is  also still a lot to be angry about—very angry.  Thewaragainstwomenisstillgoingon.  The crimes against women are many—we  are still being raped; we are still being brutalized and beaten; we are still being mur-  10  APRIL 1993 IWP  IWD marchers along Georgia Street  dered; we are still being pushed into low  paying, low-status jobs; we are still the last  hired and first fired; we are still being sexually abused by our fathers and uncles and  brothers; we are still forced to live in poverty; we still do not have a right to proper  housing, to be able to feed our children; we  are still doubly discriminated against if we  arewomen of colouror First Nations women,  lesbians and women with disabilities.  Sometimes I think it isn't getting better,  it's getting worse. Why? I think its getting  worse when I see the changes in the immigration act—one of the most inhuman pieces  of legislation introduced by the Tory government yet. Instead of being acknowledged  and respected for their contributions to Canadian society, immigrantwomenhaveagain  become targets of a racist, sexist society and  government.  And it's the same for First Nations  women. We are still fighting for basic rights  in this country, the right to self determination, our right to our own lands, our own  languages, our own ways, to our right to live  without the fear of being murdered on the  streets of this city, or any city of this country.  The Tories and their corporate agenda  aren't stopping with the immigration law.  Their right-wing agenda is very clear—just  look at the cutbacks to women's programs.  They've been pretty sneaky about that one—  cutting a little here, a little there, until the  next thing yo u know, there's no more money,  there's no more women's programs. And  what does that mean to us? It means the  Tories are trying to silence us. It means they  are trying their very best to make sure there  is no one to speak for us on a national,  regional or local level.  Ask the woman who's been raped, the  woman who has been abused by her partner, the woman who can't get any decent,  affordable childcare, the woman who is discriminated against or sexually harassed at  work. Ask the immigrant women who are  And most of all we must support each  other in our struggles for justice—we must  stop NAFTA, we must stop the erosion of  our social services such as UIC and Medicare, we must stop the cutbacks to women's  programs and say we will not tolerate racist  and sexist immigration laws. We must let  them know once and for all, that we will  stand together, that we are not afraid and  that we will not be silenced!  The following are excerpts of some longer  speeches made at the same rally.  |  Anju Gogia  -f  South Asian Women's Action  |  Network (SAWAN)  "- Existing services and agencies do not  ■£   satisfy the needs of South Asian women in  ]l   Canada, and specifically in the lower main-  °"  land.

We demand a real financial commitment from this government for their so-  called "celebration of diversity." It is time  that the Tory government lived up to its  promises. We need more than words to work  towards providing services for South Asian  women in this province.  Fatima Jaffer  IWD Committee  This year's IWD march and rally nearly  didn't happen, but at the last minute, a bunch  of women came together and did the work.  Women of colour and First Nations women  were crucial in this process and, as you can  see from today's rally, we are here in good  faith to make this movement stronger. We  expect nothing but the same from our white  sisters.  Tough times can do two things: they can  bring out the worst in us—and we can  easily reproduce the classism, racism and  homophobia that's pressing in on us on all  sides—or we can commit ourselves to our  best—move beyond guilt and fear and recreate a movement of women with the political  will and consciousness that no right-wing,  Anju Gogia of SAWAN with  Raminder Dosangh of IMA  racist, misogynist, or homophobic backlash  can break.  International Women's Day has always  been a hopeful time. Let's use it well in our  work together in the coming year.  Shelagh Day  National Action Committee on the  Status of Women  Lesbians face a hostile and dishonest  government prepared to spend whatever  public dollars are necessary to beat off our  claims for justice and recognition. They've  opposed in court every human rights and  Charter claim made by lesbians and gay men  over the last eight years using our dollars to  do it. Let us also not forget that this year we  lost the Court Challenges program, and this  means that the equality rights that women  fought so hard for now belong to the rich  and not to all of us.  Let us not forget that this has all been  brought to us by Canada's own madonna,  our lady of the fair shoulders. This is the  woman who is now touted as Canada's next  prime minister, perhaps because she has  been so enthusiastic about pursuing the male  agenda.  Let us not forget however, that all  women are fighting extraordinary battles  now, to bring all of our injustices against us  out of the closet whether we're lesbians,  women of colour, aboriginal women,  whether we have a disability, whether we  live below the poverty line, whether we're  victims of violence, we refuse silence and we  refuse invisibility...and we are absolutely  committed to the struggle for justice for  women.  Carmela Allevato  Hospital Employees Union  What we have to do today is to look at  what is happening to the social fabric, the  social safety net in Canada, in British Columbia, we have to look at what's happening to the women in this country and this  province, and commit ourselves to working  together to fight those that would put us  down, those that would hold us back.  My union, the Hospital Employees Union, represents 38,000 people. Eighty-five  percent of those people are women and our  members are the lowest-paid women in the  unionized work force in health care. What is  happening in that industry, as changes to  health care delivery are instituted, is that the  work of providing care is being taken out of  unionized workplaces and put back onto  families, onto individuals within those communities.  And it will be women who will be expected to pick up that load—underpaid,  overworked, unrecognized. That is not acceptable. This is what our movement in  British Columbia at this time will be committed to fighting.  APRIL 1993  11 5-  The following are excerpts of a joint presentation made by an immigrant woman and  refugee woman from Iran last November at Making the Links: An ti-Racism and Feminism,  the 16th annual conference of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of  Women. The women have chosen not to use their real names for security reasons.  From Iran to  n  . by Fahahimeh  I  We're here to speak our experiences as refugees. We don't feel comfortable  doing this, because we are three women from Iran—many different people come  here as refugees but they come from many different backgrounds. We cannot even  claim to represent all Iranian women refugees, because a Kurdish Iranian refugee  experiences her life and her social, political and ethnic struggle differently from, say,  a Persian Iranian woman. So, when we are talking about refugee women, imagine  how different the experiences of women from Guatemala or from Sri Lanka are.  We are also not academics. We are here simply to share our experiences and  make more visible how refugees feel about being typed as refugees, and how they  view this phenomenon of being "refugees" from within the category of refugee, and  not from the outside.  There are about 17 million refugees in the world. The majority of them are  women and children. My understanding is that this figure doesn't include those  people who have been displaced inside their own countries, and who are not  protected but are persecuted by their own governments.  According to the United Nations, a refugee is an individual who, owing to "his"  founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of "his"  nationality and is unable, or owing to such fears, unwilling to avail "himself" of the  protection of that country.  What is "persecution"? In countries known as "refugee-producing countries,"  sometimes the police or the security will knock at your door, come in, look through  your house, search through everything, read your journals or your diary, violate  your private life and take everything—take you, your sister, your mother, your  brother, your father, whomever they want and have targeted. Sometimes they take  all the family. Sometimes they take only the children, because they want to use them,  to torture them, to make the adults talk and to give information.  When we talk about persecution, we should first understand what we are  talking about, and the fear of that persecution. And sometimes, we don't flee our  countries to protect ourselves but to protect others—if you know they are after you  and there are other people involved, it may put their lives in danger.  By the way, you may have noticed, the definition doesn't refer to refugee as  "she" or "her," but as "he," "him" or "his." It shows how the consequences women  pay for political, racial and religious activities are undermined globally. So even  when women manage to escape persecution and come to other countries and talk  about their political activities, nobody believes them. They do not believe these  women can be political activists or social activists. I remember whenl first came here  being told: "don't say anything about your political background. Say that you didn't  like wearing Chador [the black veil]." It was true but it wasn't my main issue. "Or  say you couldn't have beer or you couldn't have a boyfriend. These are more  acceptable."  At the same time as our political and social activities are undermined, our  oppression due to domestic violence, or physical, psychological and cultural intolerance is not recognised as legitimate ground for seeking protection and safety. Yet,  when we talk about these things, they are real.  If we believe everything we do is a political statement, then what about the  woman walking on the streets of Tehran who gets picked up by the police because  her hair is uncovered? Is that not a political activity? If you are persecuted just  because your hair is uncovered, that is a political activity, a social activity.  When women are arrested, they go to jail and pay a penalty to get out, like being  flogged. These are serious issues yetnobody cares about them. Instead, they say: "we  hear this is the rule in your country, so you have to obey it."  Another thing is, Canada cannot discourage refugees from seeking refuge  without referring to international politics. The refugee crisis is rooted in the unjust  distribution of power globally. Refugee are not produced merely by their local  governments. This is a big lie.  Refugee women have been forced out of our homes and this is something we can  never forget. When we come here—women from Africa, Asia, Europe, Central  America—we all are hurt in the same way and by the same people. It creates a bond  between us. It unifies us. We have the same feelings. When a woman from El  Salvador talks about her persecution, I can understand what she says. When she talks  about her fears, I understand what she says. It would be really good if it could also  unify our efforts to do something for other women who are in camps.  It's interesting to note that, despite the public myth, only a small number of war  refugees come to Western countries. And these are the very countries that are  responsible for our homelessness. The majority of refugees remain in countries  neighbouring their own under the most inhumane conditions—facing starvation,  illness, violence, rape, sexual harassment, prostitution and any other hardship you  can possibly imagine.  We acknowledge their existence but we cannot hear them. In fact the pain is so  great, most of us don't want to hear them, because we can't bear the pain, we can't  bear thinking that, at this moment when we are sitting here safe and sound talking  about refugees, there are refugees living in Sri Lanka, there are refugees living in  other countries, people from Ethiopia and Somalia, people from Yugoslavia, and  that these women are concerned about their children's lives, about their own lives—  that they are in danger of losing their lives at this very moment.  Yet, when this small number of refugees make it to Western, developed, wealthy  countries in the name of humanitarianism and compassion, they will face further  discrimination, violence, isolation and loneliness.  Not only are our life experiences and struggles for freedom not recognised in the  West, but neither are our work experiences, professional skills and education. This  is double hardship. You finally come here, and you have all these abilities but you  can't practice what you know, and you can't contribute it to this society.  Refugees also get blamed for any social shortcomings in this society—if the  unemployment rate goes up, refugees get blamed; if there is an increase in taxes,  refugees get blamed; if there's a cut in social services, refugees get blamed. Because  ii "they" are the ones who abuse the system and make government to do these things.  j: But refugees are not victims—they are survivors. They have a lot to contribute.  KING   ACTION  j.     by Sheida  Thank you for accepting me as an "honorary" refugee [for the purposes of this  panel]. I don't feel I have any right to talkabout the refugee woman's experience. We  sometimes tend to think of immigrant and refugee women as being interchangeable,  but the experiences are not the same.  I also have to acknowledge that I come here as a privileged woman from a middle-  class background. When I came here, I was not "declassed," like a lot of refugees who  come here who may be from middle or upper-class backgrounds, have a little bit of  money, and yet become "declassed " when they arrive here. This is not what happened  to me—I had my class privilege allowed me, to enable me to go to university quite  easily and to study and all the kinds of things that come with class privilege. So I speak  from that position. I have also worked with immigrant women's organisations, with  mainstream white women's organisations, and also with government organizations.  But what I have to say today was written in collaboration with everybody else on  the panel, as well as being based on my experience.  Basically, we have categorized the barriers to Iranian refugee women organising  for change. One is the problems we face within our own community. While we are part  of our communities, we consider ourselves part of the global community of women  who suffer from patriarchal systems that are dominant everywhere. When we come  here to Canada, we also face the patriarchal legal system that a lot of refugee women  have to go through.  As part of our survival strategy, we know we need to organise. But we are faced  with many problems. There is the limitation of our time, finances, skills and day-today struggle to survive the economic and emotional hardship.  Another barrier is, once we struggle to organise, we are barely supported by men  in our community. We are often accused of being Westernised—which means allying  with imperialists and betrayal of our unified class struggle for democracy—and all  kinds of other things...being sexually promiscuous, whatever, because we are coming  together as women, and we want to organise something for ourselves. And we are  further accused of denying our culture and of challenging patriarchal values of family  systems.  Yet another regards government policies. Often ethnic community groups which  subscribe to patriarchal non-political values are funded by the government and this  perpetuates the silencing of women who want to make some changes within our  community.  With regards to our relationship with other women's groups, often white  women's groups inCanada are unawareof howlranian women are oppressed in Iran.  In fact, they are largely unaware of refugee and immigrant women's issues in general.  Also, even immigrant or refugee women's groups who want to help us are  involved with issues of funding and understaffing, or find it difficult to share skills  with the Iranian community, for example, which is more new and recent than any  other community. A lot of other immigrant communities are well organised and can  react to situations much faster than we can.  Another barrier is that many Iranian women have the experience and skills of  political and community activity in Iran, but these skills are not recognised when they  come here, and are often ignored by women's groups in Canada.  We have a bunch of suggestions here, and we think that, in order to fight for social  change for refugee women, you need to recognise and understand the problems that  newly arrived refugee women have, such as shortage of time, lack of resources, and  ideological differences with a lot of women's groups here, as well as their concern for  democracy and freedom back home.  And all that takes time, and you are going through turmoil, you're going through  a lot of thinking, and a lot of adjusting. The first step has to be a learning process for,  I think, both sides. You have to become aware of the stereotypical, unrealistic  portrayal of women of other countries in your media. In order to understand this  process of misinformation, we need to put this process of misinformation in a global  context of international politics, of imperialism and capitalism.  For example, there are a lot of things now being said about Iran, and about how  much reform is taking place. You see the Amnesty International report and it says that  the killing has been slowed down over the last year. That's because of Iran's  relationship with other countries, economically, which has expanded—they have to  buy their concerns in some ways. So you put it into a political context. Unless you do  that, you won't know why that they don't want to have Iranian refugees in Canada  now more than ever. They think the situation's getting better now, right?  And, as far as discrimination against refugee women in Canadian society, you  need to support the progressive struggle of women abroad and here in Canada in  different communities. There are a lot of progressive women's groups in different  communities, and it's important to find the most progressive ones that you can work  with, not the ones that feed into the stereotypical idea of what Iranian women do or  are or what their culture is all about.  If you say, for example, as [minister for immigration] Valcourt says, that flogging  of women in the country is a cultural issue, these are the rules and laws of that country  and they have to be obeyed by women, then you are feeding into a stereotypical racist  attitude about women in Iran. Violence against oneself is not accepted anywhere on  this planet by any woman.  Also, if women want to advocate for refugee women, they have to take guidance  from them—you cannot just do it on your own because you have the resources and  you have the organisations. You can't just help them. It's important to recognize that  refugee women know their issues better than anybody else.  Here maybe I will refer to an incident that made us really angry last year, to  illustrate to you the kind of problems that we usually face in terms of organising.  Shortly before International Women's Day in 1992, we were heavily involved in  organizing our efforts to gain support from other so-called progressive groups, in  by Fatima Jaffer  While immigrant, women's and human rights groups are demanding gender persecution be included in the legal definition of a refugee in this country, two Iranian women, whose  refugee claims were rejected by the ministry of immigration, took action last month to protest  their imminent deportations to Iran.  Zahra Zarnoush and Kobra Gho-  poghlou made the sidewalk outside immigration offices in downtown Vancouver their home, and went on a hunger  strike for 22 days, awaiting a response  from the minister of immigration,  Bernard Valcourt.  Ghopoghlou says going on the hunger strike was her last resort. "We have  heard nothing from the Canadian government. [My family has] been [in  Canada] for three years. My daughter  [is] now...five years old and speaks more  English than she does Farsi," says  Gopoghlou. "The government knows  better than us what will happen if we go  back."  Zarnoush's story is a little different.  More than three years ago, she left Iran  with her six-month-old child, without  "permission" from her husband,because  he was abusive. She says her husband  went to the Canadian embassy in Iran to  complain.  Zarnoush elaborates, "When I went  for my hearing here in Vancouver, the  judge said, 'you have kidnapped the  child. He belongs to your husband and  you have to go back. But don't worry,  nothing will happen to you'."  "Can they guarantee that? Even if my husband does not kill me, I will not have a life if  I return because they will say I 'stole' my child away from his father. That's what they're  already saying."  The two women were not alone in their protest. Zarnoush's four-year-old son and  Ghopoghlou's five-year-old daughter, both of whom who were staying with friends, visited  daily. Sharing the mattress on the sidewalk were five Iranian men, whose claims had also  been rejected.  Many from Vancouver's Iranian community and human rights groups in Vancouver  came out to support the action. The strike was also aimed at bringing attention to the cases  of about 90 refugee claimants in BC who are facing deportation to Iran because they have  been refused refugee status.  Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) statistics show the IRB in Vancouver is considered to have one of the highest rejection rates of refugee claimants in Canada. About a third  of all rejected Iranian refugee claims in Canada were in BC.  Ten days later after the protest began, the hunger strikers totalled 14—ten refugees, and  four landed immigrants who had joined the strike to protest "the assault on all our human  rights." Representatives from local women's groups and from the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) also attended the almost-daily rallies that took place.  However, by then, both Zarnoush and Gopoghlou were sick with the flu. A volunteer  doctor, who examined the strikers daily, warned they we're in danger of contracting  pneumonia if they didn't stop. A number of times, strikers were rushed to hospital for  emergency treatment for various degrees of stomach problems, internal bleeding and  problems with hearing.

She was to be deported because her husband's claim had been rejected.  We had no financial resources, limited time and no skills to deal with the media. We  had some language barriers and we had day-to-day responsibilities, like going to  work, eating, stuff like that.  So we reached out for support. We contacted labour women, immigrant and  other women's organisations. It is sad that the only effective support came from  number of immigrant women's organisations and community activists.  On International Women's Day, we brought a petition in support of stopping the  deportation of the Iranian woman in custody, and we provided an information sheet  on the situation of Iranian women in Iran. To our dismay and anger, many refused to  sign the petition. This was even as we were providing them with information about  the law of retribution in Iran.  This shows us we have long way to go until Western women fully understand the  plight of many women abroad, or even here as immigrant women.  Almost everybody I know in our community is a community worker! And they  don't get paid for it. They spend a lot of time helping other women to settle, and  dealing with other people's problems. We do not have time to come and talk to  mainstream white women's organisations about what our problems are. You have to ...  go ahead and educate yourselves about it. This is primarily on your shoulders, as y '  white feminist activists and fighters for social justice, to enhance public awareness of  specific women, to see some common ground on which we can all fight together.  0  12 " °  t^^  *cb^  u  Mahshid, a crisis worker from Women Against Violence Against Women (WAVAW),  who had been supporting Zarnoush's case and translating for her throughout, told Kinesis  "we are afraid Zahra cannot take much more. She has developed a terrible cough. It's getting  worse every day and she could even die, if she doesn't stop."  But Zarnoush didn't stop. On March 6, at a rally to celebrate International Women's Day  in Vancouver, she and Gopoghlou asked the women's movement to advocate on their behalf.  Two days later, on International Women's Day, a number of grassroots women's organisations flooded Valcourt's fax machine with letters demanding a response to the plight of the  refugees.  That same day, NAC and the Canadian Council of Refugees released the case summaries  of 14 refugee women at simultaneous news conferences in Montreal and Toronto. All the  women face deportation. All 14 women face death or torture upon their return to their  respective countries—by the state, their husbands, or both. NAC has since been asked to  increase the number of cases they are monitoring to 23, including Zarnoush's case.  So far, they have received word that Valcourt has intervened in four of the cases. "But  these are just temporary stays, and there is nothing that says the women will not be  deported," says Beverly Bain of NAC.  NAC and advocates for women refugees are also calling for a moratorium on deportations  of women facing gender-based violence and lobbying the government for legislation that  will make gender-based violence grounds for a refugee claim, [see page 5.]  Despite the national and international outcry and hundreds of  testimonials regarding human  rights violations inlran which have  flooded the minister's office,  Valcourt remained silent.  "He could return a phone call,"  the lawyer for one of the men on  the strike told participantsata rally  outside Immigration Canada.  The only response the refugees and their supporters received  from ministry officials was that the  Iranian hunger-strikers do not face  imminent deportation because "avenues of appeal" were still open,  and thus, the strike was unnecessary. One even went so far as to say  he was not too concerned because,  for muslims, this was the month of  Ramadlian—fasting from sunrise to  sunset.  The refugees say the Canadian  government knows that simply  leaving Iran illegally and asking  for refugee status in another country is considered grounds for arrest, torture and possibly execution, for being a traitor to the state  of Iran.  It wasn't until Day 22 of the  protest that the government responded. The lawyer for one of the hunger strikers received  a letter from the ministry "promising" that the refugee claims will be reviewed, but only if  the hunger strikers end their strike.  Upon the advice of the lawyer, thirteen of the hunger strikers officially broke their strike  with soup and salad at a nearby restaurant—the fourteenth, Ghopoghlou, was at home, too  ill to attend.  "We have not seen the letter [from the ministry]," says Saeed Parto of the International  Federation of Iranian Refugees and Immigrants Council, "but we know they have promised  to review each of the cases individually, both in BC and in Ottawa. We are also waiting for  a time frame for those reviews."  The government also said they will review Canada's position on human rights in Iran  and the criteria for returning people to Iran, and will hold consultations with the Iranian  community on this matter.  Parto is not as optimistic as others about the ministry's response. "These are just  'promises.' There has been nothing definite. And deportation is still open. The larger issue  hasn't disappeared at all."  Parto says, "The thing is, the refugees ended the hunger strike in good faith that the  government will look at their cases. But we will continue the struggle every day. It's not just  about ten refugees getting accepted. There are many more. My understanding is the  Canadian government has softened its stance on human rights violations in Iran in the last  two years."  Parto says he believes Canada's change of policy regarding sending back refugees to  Iran is integrally connected to new economic opportunities with Iran. He is referring to  Mulroney's investment of two billion dollars in trade credits to Iran, following a campaign  by Iran to improve its human rights image last year.  However, Parto notes that, in 1991, 113,000 women were arrested for minor dress  violations, and 770 persons were executed for political differences with the government, and  the situation hasn't substantially changed.  "Women are the very immediate victims of the Iranian system and Canada has to  recognise that." says community activist Yassaman Bayani.  "And it's not like the government doesn't know what will happen to these people," says  Bayani. "They know, but they don't give a shit and the only thing that's going to change  things is pressure from the grassroots."  Referring to the decision to end the hunger strike, Bayani says she believes "there's a bit  of an impasse there because of the strategy being used. This thing is not over at all. The strike  is over because the government doesn't want us to disgrace them anymore, not because we  got any guarantee that the deportations will stop.  "We know the only language the Tories understand is pressure and we need to continue  to apply that."  Bayani says it was "the presence of women's groups—NAC, Vancouver Rape Relief and  Women's Shelter, WAVAW and Vancouver Status of Women—that made a huge difference.  It's true they were late getting in on the action, but now we know we should have called the  women's groups from the start. They don't play 'nice' with the Tory government, which is  what we're being asked to do, and they don't look at things case by case, which is what the  government is asking us to do.  "The pressure must not stop. We need the direct action to continue and I hope we will  continue to work with the women's movement to achieve that."

The plenary was  titled "Healing the Feminist Movement."  When I was asked to be on this panel, I  started thinking about the theme of this conference—healing the feminist movement. I  tried to fathom what was meant to be conveyed by this word "healing." My initial  reaction was kind of hostile, but after some  reflection, my feelings about the use of the  term are more mixed.  As a lesbian—and that's the way I first  responded to the term healing—the language really gave me the willies. I had this  image of tweedy psychiatrists, nice trim  beards, pipes and couches and all, talking  abouthealing. And inmydream, they would  say, "why don't you tell us all about why  you like girls so much? Why don't you tell us  what exactly it is you do with those girls?  And we would really like the details, if you  don't mind."  And I would resist this question. And  they would say, "we have ways to help  you." I would say, "well, I feel quite fine,  thank you. I don't think I need any help."  This conversation would go on and on,  but the end would be that I would be healed  whether I wanted to be healed or not. That's  part of the reason why I went "eek!" when I  heard the word "healing."  On the other hand, 1 had an image of  when I was a little kid. My mom worked as  a bartender at a country club and, when I  was sick, I'd be at home by myself watching  TV. When my mother would get home, I'd  be upset. I'd whine and moan and complain  about how come everyone on TV had mothers who would stay at home and, when they  were sick, bring them chicken soup and that  kind of thing, while all I got was to watch the  Brady Bunch and eat Kraft dinner.  It's a nice word in that sense to me,  because it appeals to my middle-class aspirations. My sense is that neither image is  what conference organizers are trying to  convey by the use of the word healing, that  what they really have in mind is the broader  political context of the feminist movement.  When I consider the language on that level,  I still end up having mixed feelings, for a  couple of reasons.  In dominant culture, healing has become a popular and even commercialized  concept. You can see that in the growth in  circulation of self-help books, the absolute  explosion of 12-step programs, the prevalence of therapy, and so on. While I recognize healing is an authentic and liberating  concept for some political movements—especially within aboriginal circles—my difficulty, in thinking about the feminist movement, is that "healing" conveys and further  privatized the harms of systemic oppression. It excludes the realities that these injuries arise from structuralized, institutionalized imbalances of social, economic and  political power.  Feminists know our real enemy is male  supremacy and that, for years, male  supremacists have declared our movement  dead. The privatizing and therapizing image of feminism is one way of deeming us  politically dead—self-absorbed, inward-  turned, no longer a political challenge.  Viewed from inside the movement,  when one tries to imagine what we are recovering from, it is hard to avoid suspicion  that 'we' refers to white, middle-class privileged feminists, whose theorizing and practice for so long have been exclusionary and  self-referential. And the criticisms that are  articulated by women of colour, lesbians,  working class women are legitimate, and  labelling white feminism's racist and classist  and heterosexist assumptions is just. So to  bring internal division around the notion  that the movement has been wounded is to  me profoundly troubling, in two respects.  First, I think it misapprehends the political intentions of criticisms from the margins, particularly from those whose politics  is centred on ending other forms of inequality. I don't think their intent has been to  wound the feminist movement. Rather, it's  been to improve it, to breathe new life into it,  Healing looks a lot like  doing nothing to me and  not engaging in real  problems...  ss  to make it relevant to and respectful to more  women. But intentions aside, I think the  metaphor of healing provides no useful blueprint of how we must reform.  In the old days, these criticisms were  met by responses like this: "that can't be so  because some of my best friends are gay, or  black, or whatever," a kind of response that  implied that there was no problem at all.  Another thing I heard often was, "when  you point out my privilege, it makes me feel  bad." It's not quite the same thing as simple  denial, but it deflects attention from the  problem at hand and suggests that the problem resides with the critic and not the privileged. Another thing that we did, I think, is  a lot of finger pointing, trying to find out  who were the worst offenders, for instance,  among white women, as if we were somehow better, and never got to the substance of  critiques of the racist ideas and practices  within feminism.  More commonly now, I think, the response to criticisms is simple silence. We say  nothing and do nothing. It's as if, when we  were told that we shouldn't speak for people  who have historically been denied the opportunity to speak, we took that to its furthest extreme and decided to say nothing at  all.  Some recent examples of this are first of  all, the lack of response to the criticisms of  Butler [the .Supreme Court decision that  changed the basis of the obscenity law in  Canada] that have been made in the press  lately.  Ithascomeas quite a surprise to me that  feminism hasn't stood up and defended what  it did in the name of women to get that case.  The other example is that, after the federal  government announced it was prepared to  amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to  include sexual orientation and some lesbians were articulating what I consider to be  feminist concerns about what the government was up to and how it was being received within 'the community,' again feminists had nothing to say.  So in this context, resorting to the metaphor of healing seems a response that's actually consistent with old strategies of denial.  Healing looks a lot like doing nothing to me  and not engaging in real problems, having a  period of convalescence and, again, not dealing with the substance of what is now our  biggest problem.  I actually can't think of another metaphor, which is kind of a shame, but there are  metaphors which I think are very useful,  thatgalvanize political movements—likethe  personal is political; though, while I think  tha t has been useful, there are problems with  that metaphor too.  I do have some ideas about what needs  to be done, so what I thought I would do is  set out some principles instead that we can  use to get us closer to what I call, the politics  of engagement.  I think we should recognize that feminism is a politics—it's not a club for people  with certain anatomical morphology. It's  not a haven or a home, so it's not necessarily  a safe place to be. What makes it a politics is  that it makes a stand on women's inequality—relations of dominance and subordination that are institutionalized in this society  along gender lines. It doesn't mean that  other forms of systemic oppression are irrelevant or secondary. It doesn't mean that all  women are oppressed all the time every  place. And it doesn't mean that all women  are oppressed in precisely the same way,  every time, and in every place.  This makes it all very hard and complicated. I don't think any of the people, in my  reading, who have made these internal critiques have actually come to some kind of  definitive conclusion to what all the implications are for the questions of intersectionality  [the relationship between race, class, gender, and other sites of oppression]. We  haven't figured it out.  If you choose to engage in a politics that  acknowledges these things, you're going to  make mistakes because we don't have all the  answers—it's a risky business. The critical  question is not whether you're going to make  mistakes, but what you're going to do about  it.  I don't think saying it is risky or that  we're bound to screw up occasionally means  you can be cavalier about making mistakes.  It does mean we can take steps to minimize  the kinds of mistakes that we make—we  have to get down to doing our homework,  understanding thatotherissuesarenot separate from feminist issues and it's our responsibility to go out and learn about them. And  we have to change the way our organizations are structured and our decisions are  made. We have to share power. Once you do  that, you actually expose yourself more to  risk because you are in contact with people  who are going to challenge you more that  way.  Finally when you do make a mistake,  you have choices about how you are going to  respond, how to learn from that mistake and  do it better next time.  I realize this all sounds very platitudinous and nice, so I thought I would try to  apply these principles to the two examples  that I mentioned earlier on. That is, what's  happening around the Butler decision and  what's happening around the Canadian  Human Rights amendments.  What happened with the Canadian  Human Rights amendments is that it exposed a division in the lesbian and gay community about what was important. The lesbian feminists who have difficulty with the  proposals aren't suggesting that sexual orientation should not be added to the Code but  that problems about multiple inequalities  need to be addressed.  One problem was the addition of yet  another general abstract term. We've seen  how race protection in human rights instruments works to protect not only people of  colour but white people too. That's a problem.  We also recognize, drawing on the experience of women of colour, that unless  something is done, these guarantees will  continue to be interpreted in a watertight  way—that is, when women of colour try to  articulate a legal claim that proceeds from a  position of being women of colour, they  often ended up getting no protection because the courts and the adjudicators say,  "this is not what race discrimination looks  like, or what sex discrimination looks like, so  you get nothing."  We have to share power.  Once you do that, you  actually expose yourself  more to risk...  There are many more problems. Why  have feminists not responded to the attacks  that have been made against the lesbian  feminists who articulated what I've tried to  show are clearly feminist concerns? It seems  to me, people are more uncomfortable with  being seen as having backtracked on what  they thought was the progressive stance to  take, that is, to back the addition of sexual  orientation to the Human Rights Act. I think  it also has something to with a studied reluctance to take a stand on what are ostensibly  other people's issues. A politics of engagement requires that heterosexual feminists  admit these are feminist concerns, and offer  the lesbian feminists who articulate them  some support.  I'm going to add, the worst thing that  will happen if heterosexual feminists decide  to do this is that some lesbians and gays are  going to call you homophobic—that is the  worst that will happen.  The other example I have is Butler. Butler is a feminist argument about the real  harms of pornography to women, in the  context of a culture of normalized sexual  violence against women. Nowhere in the  argument was a stand taken on whether  lesbian and gay erotica is different from  heterosexual pornography. I think that's a  very contentious issue—people are divided  on it. We should continue to talk about it.  But what has been said in the press by  the anti-Butler contingent, composed largely  of lesbian and gay liberationists, is that lesbian and gay erotica is different just because  it's different, and feminists are anti-gay because they support a judicial decision which  actually protects some women. This is wrong-  handed. It doesn't take into account what  was actually done in Butler.  Again, the failure to respond to attacks  on feminism has much more to do with the  fact that these criticisms have come from the  lesbian and gay community, and people are  so afraid of standing up for a feminist victory for fear of being called homophobic or  anti-gay that again nothing has been said. In  the failure to stand up for feminism, the  worst thing that could happen is that feminism could self-destruct and that will be the  end.

Scott Gallery  Emily Carr College of Art & Design  Vancouver, BC  Whenever sculptor Persimmon Black-  bridge mounts a new show, you can be sure  of walking into something big, something  whole. She's a world-maker, as much storyteller as visual artist and, in Sunnybrook, she  walks us through a discordant tale of life and  labour in an institute for the 'mentally handicapped.'  This isn't the first time Blackbridge has  drawn us into an institutional nightmare.  StUl Sane (1984) and Doing Time (1989) focused on psychiatric hospitals and prisons.  Both were intensely political and personal  collaborations between Blackbridge and  women who have been incarcerated. In  Sunnybrook, the story is more her own. (It's  about collaboration, too, but of a different  sort.) And while her earlier shows followed  clear paths of pain and resistance, this show  is more complex and clever.  Staring down the length  of the gallery, you  become aware of  standing inside an  exploded city, whose  people and buildings  hang on the walls like  torn seeds.  .;  Janey  and our imaginations? As adults with 'mental handicaps,' or teenagers with 'learning  disabilities,' are we helped by the systems  provided, or simply made more manageable?  Sunnybrook is about dissonance and the  sham of surface truths. Here, 'retarded' people possess extraordinary insights; deaf people hear; helpers do not help; adults are  'kids;'inmatesappearashappypeopleabout  town (but not really)...  This dissonance extends to how the show  can be experienced. For all the heaviness of  its subject matter, Sunnybrook can be a light  ride. Many of the images are delightful, exuberant. There is playfulness in the chaotic  angles; in the miniature furniture, books,  and art work (the shrink's office is ringed  with tiny Van Goghs; Diane's home has a  tiny Jo Cook and a Debbie Bryant—two local  Sunnybrook is like good  political theatre, with a  cast of complex  characters, visual  spectacle, a surprising  range of emotions—the  pieces are anguished  and whimsical, raw and  analytical—and  reflections on power,  identity and personal  morality.  Sunnybrook explores another of society's literal lock-ups, but it's also a trip  through the mindfield (pun intended) of  communication and text, of personal and  public codes, and the strain between pictures and words.  Theshowisvast.Staringdownthelength  of the gallery, you becomeawareof standing  inside an exploded city, whose people and  buildings hang on the walls like torn seeds.  Sunnybrook consists of 25 separate pieces—  three-dimensional scenes and characters  constructed of painted plywood, metal plates,  photographs, wire mesh, plexiglass, book  covers, doll furniture and miniatures (computers, books, picture frames etc).  Hanging beside each piece are copies of  the accompanying text. The type is large  enough to be read off the wall, but a viewer  can collect their own sheet, which is also  helpful to people with sight impairments  (audio tapes are available). By the end of the  show, you will have a substantial sheath of  papers—there's a lot of reading material  here.  The story tracks a couple of months in  the life of Diane—Persimmon's nom dewaged  ivork—who gets a job as a one-to-one counsellor at the Sunnybrook Institution for the  Mentally Handicapped. Diane is a fraud.  She lied on her application about having  worked in a child guidance clinic—in fact,  she was a patient there, a 'learning disabled'  teen. Having convinced the head psychiatrist she understands behaviour modifica  tion techniques—she does, on the receiving  end—Diane is assigned to three inmates.  Her task is to improve their communication skills. Stuart is 29, white and blind.  He has been at Sunnybrook all his life.  Gentle and profoundly neglected, Stuart  spends most days rocking in front of a  television. Janey, another lifer, is frequently  strait-jacketed and tossed into solitary confinement for breaking things or biting people [see photo]. She's young, white and selectively articulate; like Stuart, she easily repeats words and phrases she hears, and she  sings. Mary is a 36 year-old Native woman  who came to Sunnybrook at seven. She has  a stringof labels—"borderline retarded, non-  communicative, anti-social and deaf." Mary  is defiant, knowledgeable and, as Diane  learns, not completely deaf. Shirley, another inmate, also looms large. She's a lesbian and knows exactly how to push Diane's  buttons.  For two months, Diane treads through  the Sunnybrook system. It's a world of repression, boredom, violence and small joys.  She collaborates—Diane fakes it with her  boss in order to keep the job; she fantasizes  about pursuing this as a career—and she  subverts the system, too, by trying to pay  attention to what Stuart, Janey and Mary  want. She also dips in and out of the world  of Harlequin romance, via a paperback she  discovers stuffed behind a toilet in the basement washroom. (Diane is a lesbian, but  escape is escape.)  The journey through Sunnybrook is a  familiar Blackbridge tour. Once again, she  exposes the brutalities of institutional life  and the politics of social control in a style that  is non-rhetorical and often wry. Sunnybrook  is like good political theatre, with a cast of  complex characters, visual spectacle, a surprising range of emotions—the pieces are  anguished and whimsical, raw and analytical—and reflections on power, identity and  personal morality.  But Sunnybrook also vibrates with a tension between its text and its images. They  hang side-by-side on the wall, but often tug  the viewer in different directions. You see  and feel one thing (the energy of the image,  the emotional tones of colour, texture) then  read and think another. Do they tell the same  story? Which is the more authoritative version of Sunnybrook? Can the mind really hold  these two ways of knowing at the sa me time?  These aren't just abstract philosophical  questions. At the heart of Sunnybrook is an  inquiry into the politics of communication  and reality. Whose code, whose version  comes out on top?  Woven throughout the show is Diane's  owndif ficult story of learning to speak, learning to write. Her difficulty, in fact, was in  learning to conform. Sunnybrook asks: are we  taught to communicate in order to relate, or  to be controlled? When we learn language,  are we merely learning to echo acceptable  meanings, acceptable renditions of reality?  As kids, are we forced to colonize ourselves  artists); in the romancenovel cut-outs (nurse-  doctor images ad nausea); and in the sheer  fun Blackbridge has with herself—Diane is  often represented with photos from Drawing  the Line, the lesbian sexuality show  Blackbridge collaborated on in 1988.  The text also shifts between pain and  play: it's full of ironies, comic asides,  mutterings and sarcasm.  With all these complexities, Sunnybrook  isn't as easy to 'get' as Blackbridge's earlier  shows. And the long, intricate storyline  makes it possible to almost overlook her  artistry. Again, Sunnybrook is likegood theatre: there is so much happening, you are  undistracted by the technical skill behind the  drama.  In particular, Blackbridge's painting is  deceptively simple. While the show uses  three-dimensional materials (plywood, plastics, metal) in three-dimensional settings, it  is Blackbridge's colourful brush that gives  shape, shadow and a lively depth to  Sunnybrook.  It's an interesting trick: the flatness of 3-  D meets the roundness of paint. Like the  name itself—Sunnybrook—and like the  world within and beyond its walls, things  are not necessarily what we are lead to be-  lieve.   Nancy Pollak usually reads the caption before  looking at the picture. Pity.  For more information on Sunnybrook, call  844-3809. The gallery is wheelchair accessible  and the text is available in audio tape.  APRIL 1993 Arts  Film review: Speak it!;  Fight  the power  by Nikola Maria De Marin   SPEAK IT!  directed by Sylvia Hamilton  National Film Board, 1993  International Women's Week Film  and Video Series  Pacific Cinematheque, Vancouver  "You don't have to be from Scotland to  have a history," says Shingai Njajeha, the  hipyoungcommentatoroffilmmakerSylvia  Hamilton's latest video, Speak it!, from the  heart of Black Nova Scotia.  The rap group Public Enemy gave out  the call in their hit, Fight the Power: "most of  my heroes don't appear on no stamp."  Shingai speaks to this absence of Black history, both in the mainstream and at St.  Patrick's High, a school in Nova Scotia, when  he notes in a 380-page history text that "only  one and a half pages are about us...it's like  we've been erased."  Not only does Shingai and his classmates of colour bear witness to the institutionalized racism that obscures and in-  visibilizes the 300-year old history of Nova  Scotia's Black community, they must also  contend with the racist violence, discrimination and name calling that makes school a  hostile and harassing environment.  What is surprising about this video is  the effort and commitment of the 30 or 40  "St. Pat's" kids who go where most school  boards fear to tread. In empowering themselves to explore questions of identity and  culture, they have to contend with obstacles  that range from accessing materials and finding someone qualified to teach them, to the  daunting pedagogical prospect of teaching  themselves and their peers stuff they are in  the midst of learning.  When I look at the fact that the students  formed a group, participated in a conference, put on a play, held protests, made  presentations in class...it confirms my own  feeling that students of colour display comparatively intense commitment to their education when they are called to be so much  more resourceful, resilient and original than  their white counterparts.  As a university student, I have had to  reckon with the feeling that I was subtly  putting nails in my own coffin by internalizing so much of European thought and ideas.  Thus, the process documented in Hamilton's video, of finding personal integrity in a  white-chin chauvinist environment, is one I  can relate to on so many levels.

Review: Imagining Lesbian images;  Looking  like lesbians  by Alice Swift  IMAGINING LESBIAN IMAGES  Videos and presentation  by Myriam Fougere  Pacific Cinematheque, Vancouver  March 18  What would the world look like if we  could create it from a lesbian point of view?  What kind of reality could we create if we  didn't need to continually devote our energies to fighting the one that men have made,  the one that wants to destroy us?  These are some of the questions at the  heartofMyriamFougere's presentation, "Imagining Lesbian Images," the second event  in the Looking Like Dykes lecture and film/  video series taking place this spring at the  Cinematheque. The series provides an opportunity to discuss the ways that lesbians  "look"—both as spectators and as images—  and to consider whether there is such a thing  as a specifically lesbian aesthetic.  Fougere came to video making from  sculpture, where she had first encountered  her desire to represent women ina new way.  She fell into the practice of "cunt art" by  chance, when she was sculpting a face and  noticed that it resembled a vulva. Soon, she  was using clay, and later, porcelain to make  beautiful sculptures of vulvas in the shapes  of flowers, seashells, and other natural objects.  Fougere's video from 1984 documents  some of her sculptural work, from which  she later turned to making jewellery in the  shapes of women and their bodies. Fougere  talked about the importance of having  women-only spaces in which to exhibit her  work—in a heterosexual context, she says,  her work would be, at best, unappreciated  and, at worst, reviled or ridiculed.  Women-only spaces are the subject of  another Fougere video, Sacred Space. In the  video, a number of women speak about the  importanceofcreatinga space wherewomen  can be the centre of the experience, free from  the demanding presence of men.  According to Fougere, the video grew  out of her experiences in producing the East  Coast Lesbian Festival, an event she has been  involved with for the past four years. Finding herself unable to single-handedly answer all the questions raised by the issue of  male children at the festival, Fougere created  the video.  As was pointed out in the discussion  period following the screening, Sacred Space  includes a fairly narrow range of perspec-  See FOUGERE page 18-^H^ ^  FROM   THE   NATIONAL   FILM    BOARD   OF   CANADA  THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY  The Federal Women's Film Program presents two new videos from its WOMEN AND WORK series  that call for change, stimulate debate and challenge traditional attitudes about work and family.

The anthology breaks new ground in  recognizing the presence of a South Asian  lesbian and gay community in North  America. Before continuing with our review  of Lotus, we feel it is important to acknowledge the place from which we speak. We are  first-generation Canadians, one middle class  and the other working class. One of us is out  to her family and the other isn't. We are both  South Asian lesbians, active in the lesbian of  colour community in Vancouver.  According to Ratti, the common thread  of the work is "a sense of isolation" experienced by South Asian lesbians and gay men  tha t takes the form of racism in the West and  homophobia in the South Asian communities.  As Ratti states in his introduction: "the  benefit of coming together has been tremendous, yet we gay and lesbian South Asians  still continue to be an invisible group. We are  relatively unknown in the gay and lesbian  communities, and we are similarly overlooked in the mainstream South Asian communities. Whether because of benign neglect or a conscious desire to deny our existence, evidenced by myriad rationales, we  too often go unacknowledged in both  groups."  The voices in Lotus are diverse in several  ways. The authors are: lesbian, gay and bisexual; originate from different regions of  South Asia; have different vocations; and  live in different parts of the world, some in  Canada, the US and England while others  live in South Asian countries. The diversity,  however, does not extend to class—many of  the writers are professionals in mainstream  occupations, and only a few appear to be  working class.  There are half as many pieces by women  as there are by men. Also, while the voices  themselves are somewhat diverse, the content of the pieces all tend to deal with similar  issues—community, love and finding  "home". This gives Lotus a certain homogeneity and excludes discussions of issues  such as class, caste, ableism and motherhood.  It is also surprising that the anthology  does not explore the experience of South  Asians settling in places other than Europe  and North America, even though South  Asian peoples have a long history of migration to Africa, the Caribbean and Fiji.  The anthology does provide a very useful directory of resources for South Asian  lesbians, gays and bisexuals. Lotus is particularly important for South Asian lesbians  and gays who live in isolation, and are not  supported by a community.  The writing is quite accessible and we  i  both found it to be an easy read.  It is a powerful  acknowledgement that  South Asian women  have always had sex  with each other.  WOMEN'S WORK  SCREEN PRINT,  We give to the Commun.  that supports u:  • Women Positive  • Earth Friendly  • Community Economi  Development  • Equality Right!  Itwasdisappointingforboth of us therefore that, after reading the anthology, most  of the poetry and prose didn't have a lasting  effect on us. What did stand out for us? It was  the historic representations of lesbians in  India, as well as the interviews of some of  those presently living in India.  Photographs in the book of cave sculptures depict sex between women and historically place lesbianism in South Asian  culture. It is a powerful acknowledgement  that South Asian women have always had sex  with each other.  Ratti's statement that "just as our culture and our gayness or lesbianism sets us  apart from others, so they serve to bring us  together with one another," rings true, particularly given this historical context. Overall, Lotus of Another Color is politically important because it makes a strong statement  about our existence and survival as South  Asian lesbians, gays and bisexuals.  Many of the authors in this book don't  use their real names, even as they take evident pride in their sexual and cultural identities. One of us (Archana Gandhi) chooses  to do the same. It is an act that serves as a  reminder of the many real dangers that exist  in a racist, homophobic and sexist world.  Archana Gandhi is a South Asian lesbian  living and studying in Vancouver.  Sur Mehat is South Asian dyke living in the  spraivling working class suburb of Burnaby,  BC.  VANCOUVER  WOMEN'S  BOOKSTORE  Monday-Saturday  10:00 am-6:00 pm  315 Cambie Street Vancouver, BC  V6B 2N4 (604)684-0523 Arts  Review and interview:  Being  wicked  by Pam Fleming  VIRAGO BOOK OF WICKED  VERSE  Edited by Jill Dawson  Virago Press, London, 1993  I met Jill Dawson (alias Ruby) when we  were mutual strangers on our way to  Fiddlehead Farm last August. Fiddlehead is  an organic oasis on the northernmost tip of  the Sunshine coast in BC. It is reachable only  by boat—the Irish Mist. Fiddlehead, like  Avalon, is mythical, magical and for dreamers only.  Ruby sat on the hull of the Irish Mist.  With her short black curls, rhinestone cat's-  eye sunglasses, and black and white shorts,  she looked like she would be more at home  in a London nightclub than in the backwoods of British Columbia—and more like  Madonna than the mother she is to three-  year-old son Lewis.  Later, as we gathered on the porch of the  cookhouse, I learned that Ruby is not just a  pretty face but an editor, poet and writer.  She is author of How Do I Look?, a bookabout  adolescent women's self-imagery.  Dawson had just won the prestigious  Eric Gregory award for poetry for Britons  under 30. Her family's holiday to North  America was partially funded by the award,  which is intended to be used to broaden  one's experience through travel.  "I've never been so rich in my life!"  Ruby said, in herSouth-Londonaccent,about  the 8000-pound award. Ruby sounds like  she might be middle class, but she is from a  working class background. "I got my accent  educated out of me," she said.  Dawson's working-class background  certainly comes through in her editing of the  Virago Book of Wicked Verse that was just  released this winter.  "One way to widen the scope of an  anthology such as this is to include, as we  have, folk poems, rhythm ballads and songs,"  Dawson writes in the introduction.  "Oh my name is  Diamond Lily  I'm a whore in Piccadilly  And my father runs a brothel in the Strand.  My brother sells his arsehole  To the guards at Windsor Castle  We're the finest fucking family in the land."  -from "Diamond Lily"  "Wicked has so many meanings,"  Dawson confided as we sat getting our feet  wet in the bubbly creek the next day. "Like  humourous, subversive, spirited, sexy, unacceptable, and wick-ed as in awesome.  'Wicked' is what women are often categorized as, but being wicked, as we define it, is  generallydenied us.It's the whore/madonna  syndrome."  In order to get a broad range of wickedness, Dawson sought out poems: from  Sappho of AncientLesbos, to Chrystos of the  Menominee Nation, and Adjoah Ando of  Ghana/England; from ancient China to  modern-day Poland, Canada, Japan, India,  and more. Lesbians, straights, autoerotics,  bisexuals, libertines, celibates—anarchists,  rebels and revolutionaries—will find much  to titillate their fancies in this jam-packed  trade paperback that's a deal by its size  alone.  "The government official  speaks in English with friends,  in Hindi with servants  s his mother tongue  FOUGERE from page 16  tives on the issue—none of the women interviewed is the mother of a male baby who ha s  chosen not to bring him to the space, for  instance. In addition, the question of how  women with male children are expected to  afford to be a part of woman-only spaces is  not raised, nor is the fact that a few women's  festivals do provide separate childcare areas  for boys.  One of the women in the video expresses her surprise that some women think  we shouldn't have any women's spaces,  given that there are so few to begin with. A  Black woman talks about this type of "sacred" space in terms of political power—  that is, women having the right to determine  who does and who does not come into their  space. For similar reasons, she says, the need  exists for women of colour only spaces within  women-only spaces.  While Sacred Space addresses some  important issues, the interviews tend to become somewhat repetitious, with several  women making the same points. As a result,  the video loses momentum. It is also flawed  by what Fougere admits is an intentional  bias—the video could have been more powerful had it presented a wider range of experience among the women interviewed.  Fougere's video, Lesbian Art, marks the  bridge between her careers as sculptor and  video artist. This is a quietly "arty" video  that shows sculptures of women's bodies  being built in the sand, then washed away by  the tide. The shapes of the sand-women  constantly change as they are gradually  eroded.  Fougere shot the video in a lesbian community in Florida—it was a space where she  felt safe making sculptures of vulvas on the  beach. Considering how recent and how  rare it is, still, for women to be in control of  the way our bodies are represented, Lesbian  Art is at once very simple and very remarkable^   Alice Swift is a first-time Kinesis writer and  dyed in the wool dyke.  for his 2 Alsatian dogs."  - from "Contemporary" by Suniti Namjoshi  "I am made of rock  harder than diamond  it cuts through your conventions  and your sticky, sticky lies."  - from "Lesbian" by Caroline Claxton  "I had to include Atwood. I adore  Atwood," Dawson confesses. "There aresep-  eral Canadian poets actually," she is quick to  add, when she notes my there's-more-to-  Canada-than-Atwood look. "Like CM.  Donald, Winona Baker, and others."  Baker gives us a glimpse into the  every day wickedness of many women's  lives.  "The couple  married a long time  lives in uneasy truce  waiting  neither cares  for the way the house looks  if he were gone  she'd sell his tools  burn bits of lumber  if she goes first  he'll throw out  books and pictures  won't ask  the family if they want them  solicitously inquire  How do you feel today?"  - from "Waiting" by Win Baker  Dawson has chosen poetry for Wicked  Verse with care and clarity, humour and  thoughtfulness. Over 100 women croon,  swoon, scold, seduce and scorn in the pages  of the five sections—^Clitoris in my throat;  Listen if you dare; The bush catches fire;  Queens of the underworld; and If they can't  take a joke".  Wickedness is clearly timeless; transcending cultural boundaries.  "I like sleeping with somebody  different  It's nicest when my husband is  in a foreign country  and there's rain in the streets at night  and wind  and nobody"  - Anon, 12 c. AD  Wicked Verse is not one more eulogy to  the dead poets' society, but rather very much  alive notes from the underground:  "I'm rappin it up in a real tight squeeze  I don't cross my eyes I don't dot my teas  Shakespeare Milton Poe and Dryden  Woodsworth Eliot Great Traditions  all you poets I don't give a fuck  coz you're dead I am PA an'i am  RAPPIN  IT  UP"  - from "Rappin' it up" by Patience Agbabi  "I want it to be the kind of book that  women will come across while browsing in  bookshops, nudge each other, smile and say,  'Oh! Look at this! This is funny, or lovely, or  wicked'," Dawson explains while dipping  her big toe in the cold stream. "You know  how women get together and get into taboo  subjects and the kind of hilarity that comes  of that."  The Virago Book of Wicked Verse is guaranteed to make you "nudge, nudge wink,  wink know what I mean? Know what I  mean?" in many ways and places.

It's  either her "semi-annual mid-life crisis" or  just another cycle in her Saturn Return, but  somehow, life seems to have lost its focus.  Things have gotten so bad that, at the  peak of her ennui, Claire lets a friend talk her  into accompanying him to a market research  group. Between samples of donut holes, she  notices that the session leader is staring at  her labyris (the one she wears around her  neck).  This is to be the first and most innocuous of her encounters with Dr. Herbert  Troggle, a molecular biologist determined  to prove that lesbianism has a genetic basis.  Through a little research of her own, Claire  discovers that Dr. Troggle is so obsessed  with proving his theories that he has been  extracting urine samples from the sewer  systems serving the homes of prominent  lesbians in the community.  Questionable research methods, to be  sure, but when Claire catches Dr. Troggle  snooping around her sump pump, she finds  herself caught up in a web of intrigue, adventure, and truly hair-raising, not to mention hilarious, plot twists. All in all, it makes  for compelling reading.  To tell any more would  be to give away too  many of the surprises...  Despite its too-clever title, Well Worn  Genes is a smart, stylish, and very funny take  on contemporary dyke life. It's rare to find  a lesbian novel that is so shamelessly satirical. At the same time, Genes manages to  incorporate elements of the mystery genre  that has become so popular with dyke writers in recent years, along with the requisite  dose of eroticism and rich character development.  A first-time novelist, April Narr manages simultaneously to explore and explode  many of the straight world's myths about  lesbians. But she's clearly not above poking  fun at her own community. The characters  who populate Claire's world range from  earnest academics to playful video artists  like Lucy and Miranda, who are working on  a 50s pulp parody informed by 90s S/M  (lesbian sadomasochism) sensibilities, called  Satan Licked My Cunt, and who frequently  prevail upon Claire for advice and small  loans.  Narr's playful style has a more serious  edge, though, particularly in her characterize tionofTroggle'ssupporters,a group working toward the genetic "extinction" of lesbians. The range of personalities is a continual  surprise to Claire, as she seeks to expose  their motives. There are the moneyed and  powerful corporation owners, the sermonizing "family values" types, and even grassroots activists who spraypaint slogans like  "It's in her piss" in lesbian neighbourhoods.  It becomes impossible to know who to trust.  And politics makes strange bedfellows:  Troggle's research is also endorsed by the  "Dykes in Diapers Campaign," a group of  lesbians seeking to fit into the mainstream  by insisting that they were born as lesbians  and therefore cannot help the way they are.  The Dykes in Diapers stance is vehemently  rejected by Claire's radical friends. As  Miranda puts it, "What? We're supposed to  apologize for being this thing that's so awful  that no one could possibly want to choose it?  'Sorry, we can't help it?' I don't think so.  Whatever happened to pride? We're supposed to be proud of an accident of birth?"  Stumbling into the convoluted world of  Dr. Troggle and his backers provides exactly  the distraction from her own life that Claire  needs—particularly when she approaches  the local feminist newspaper about doing a  story on Troggle, and develops a hopeless  crush on the editor. At the same time, Claire's  involvement in her community and her faith  both in herself and in other dykes get a  much-needed boost.  A particularly powerful scene comes in  the form of a confrontation between a group  of dykes and Troggle's female assistant,  Penny, who has been sent to collect samples  from the washroom ata lesbiandance. When  she is caught and her connection to Troggle  established, a group of dykes coaxes her out  onto the dance floor and gets her dancing to  Madonna's "Express Yourself." Penny is  swept away: "It was clear now that she was  enjoying herself, her hips swaying, her eyes  half -closed, though every no w and then she'd  take a shy peek over in Claire's direction.  She started swinging her arms, and vials  were falling out of her pockets, smashing  and spilling all over the dance floor. Women  were stepping back, not wanting to slip, but  Penny kept on dancing, heedless of the lost  samples and not giving a moment's thought  to how she was going to explain this to Dr.  Troggle."  The scene is at once hilarious and empowering: a vivid and inventive example of  the power of collective resistance. It also  marks the beginning of an unlikely—but  ultimately delightful—romance between  Claire and Penny.  To tell any more would be to give away  too many of the surprises that make Genes  such a consistently enjoyable read but, believe me, you will neither predict nor be  disappointed by the ending.  Narr is an exciting new voice on the  lesbian literary scene and, whether or not  my desire is genetically induced, I look forward to reading her next creation.  Actually, I look forward to reading her  first creation—or my first creation, since  there's no such person as April Narr, and  there's no such book as Well Worn Genes.  That's right, folks, I made the whole thing  up.  Why, you ask?  I've been writing reviews for Kinesis for  close to a year now, without ever really  stopping to think muchabout whatthe whole  process entails. This exercise—besides being my dutiful fulfilment of my promise of  bringing in a story when all the other things  I was going to review fell through—helped  to raise some valuable questions.  For one thing, Well Worn Genes is the  sort of lesbian novel I would like to write—  if only because it's the sort of book I'd like to  read, and I haven't found it on the shelves  yet. There seems to be a real shortage of  satire among the lesbian-feminist titles out  there.  It's not that there's any lack of serious  issues to ridicule and seek to correct, which  is what satire is all about. One of the challenges in imagining Well Worn Genes was  coming up with scenarios that sounded so  much more ridiculous than real life that they  were obviously satirical. The genetic research idea came from a very recent news  clipping, and whether or not there are sew-  Well  Worn  Genes  a novel  by  age-obsessed scientists like Dr. Troggle, I'm  sure there are plenty of researchers who  would just love the opportunity to get inside  our pants, one way or another. None of this  is all that far-fetched: some would even  suggest that living in North America in the  latter part of the 20th century is like living in  a satire.  The other thing i s humour of any kind is  reliant for its success on a delicate balance of  inclusion and exclusion: it includes those  who are going to get the joke and excludes  those who either don't get it or are the butt of  Reviewing.-.hinges on  creating a sense (or  illusion) of community...  it. Any of us who have less power—whether  we're lesbians, women, people of colour,  people with disabilities in hetero-patriar-  chal-racist-ableist mainstream society, have  felt the exclusion of being ridiculed for what  we are. But hopefully we've also felt the  inclusion of being able to share certain codes,  vocabulary, and understanding among ourselves—jokes that those who try to deny or  suppress our existence simply wouldn't  "get" because they are not part of our communities.  Reviewing is similar, in that it hinges on  creating a sense (or illusion) of community,  if only for a moment, of those engaged with  the work being reviewed. You were either  there, and, that's what you thought, too; or  you totally disagree with what I think and  how could we have been at the same show?;  or you wanted to go, but didn't make it, and  you're either very sorry or very relieved; or  you're hearing about it now for the first time  April Narr  and hmn, that sounds kind of interesting; or  you wonder if it would be possible to bring  that show up to your town or city; or, or, or...  I have to have a bigger set of eyes, ears,  tastes than just my own when I'm seeing a  play, film, reading a book, or whatever that  I'm going to review (I also have to take  notes!), so that I can take you along too, and  bring you back some of what we saw there.  And yet at the same time, I'm still just little  ol' me with my peculiar set of assumptions,  likes and dislikes, etcetera. It's no wonder so  many reviewers (feminists too) get arrogant.  Often, one of the hallmarks of "great" mainstream reviewing is a tone of unrelieved  snottiness—you really know whether you're  "in" or "out" based on how well you can  decode the reviewer's obscure references to  little-known works, esoteric philosophies,  and so on.  Obviously, this sort of thing won't do at  Kinesis—though, as a recovering English  major, I'm always having to check my tendency to throw in obscure references; it's  possible to be academically trained into a  certain type of affection for them, y'know.  But a feminist newspaper isn't about making  women feel excluded, nor is it about trashing  anybody. That's why I also have a difficult  time reviewing anything that I really didn't  like—you know, if you can't say something  nice...  So it was a treat to have the freedom that  came with reviewing something that didn't  exist—no feelings to hurt but my own. And,  as it turned out, I had nothing but nice things  to say!  I hope I'm not the only person who'd  like to read a book like Well Worn Genes, one  that doesn't so much make fun o/lesbians as  have fun with them. (Remember that old  distinction between laughing at someone  and laughing ivith them?) In fact, I hope lots  of you would like to read it—because I think  I just might write it.

Love,  Kinesis  Happy  subscriber  Kinesis:  I'm happy to renew my subscription  early and get the regular ten issues plus one  free issue. Good deal!  I've been a subscriber since my daughter was in grade one, and now she is in her  fourth year of university. Long time, eh?  Thanks for your good work,  Joy I. Lennox  Terrace, BC  Thank you  sisters  Kinesis:  This letter is to thank women who wrote  letters and supported some of our daily  survivals.  Ma ria Verghina s of Montrea l, thank you  for remembering the anniversary of the assaults on myself, my child, and friends by  women at the Flygirls event on December 31,  1991. Your letter [see Kinesis, Feb. 93] offered  support to many women victims/survivors  like myself, Karin Mladenovic and Diane  Atkinson, in and out of the women's many  "movements". This has validated me, not  just as a casualty but also as a warrior.  Thank you, sister, for walking with me  and honouring me by including me in this  walk. This has eased my nightmares of women's fists and boots on mothers' backs while  children wail on this anniversary. Although  I did weep and drink until I couldn't remember or dream, I also had a "community" of  friends with me who wept, ate, and validated our pains of surviving woman-to-  woman violence. One friend was assaulted  on that evening with me and we have been  supportive of each other in our nightmares  and harsh realizations. I thank them too.  To my knowledge, there has been at  least one other attack on another lesbian of  colour by women involved with the organi  zation Flygirls. She too is a survivor and a  warrior, and not just a casualty.  I would also like to acknowledge a local  woman's business who has taken a stand by  refusing to sell tickets or advertise Flygirl  events until an exchange and accountability  toward an acceptable resolution has taken  place. I and my children thank you too.  Another local lesbian space has contacted Flygirls by writing letters and attempting to organize meetings (this ongoing effort  has not yet resulted in any significant exchange between Flygirls and "the community"). I thank them as well.  So, Maria, these are some of the actions  taken in Vancouver to support and educate  our communities about anti-mother, anti-  children and anti-woman attitudes since the  bashing at the Flygirls' event in 1991.  I must say that Karin's and Diane's  letters also pulled raw strings in my spirit,  and I too "had a sense of having failed  them." Their words spoke volumes to me  and befriended me. I thank them.  I also thank Susan from Toronto who  gave me her support in her letter to Kinesis a  few months ago.  To the women involved with Flygirls, I  only have the following to say: I do not have  your privilege to ignore hatred as I survive  daily. I will not go away now, as I didn't on  the night that you wanted me to go away  enough that you beat me up, in front of my  son. I had a right to take up some space then,  and I still have this right. I take pleasure in  remembering that I was the very last person  to walk out the doors.  As Maria says, "you cannot ignore us.. I  am right there, in front of you...there are  fewer and fewer places to hide from our  anger." And I am not alone.

To do otherwise is to  undermine, sometimes even destroy an artist's credibility publicly and possibly  personally. Simply put, support is the responsibility of the exhibit staff. (It does not  preclude or deny critical discourse or intelligent feedback around the work).  What happened to the artist, Diana  Kemble following the quagmire at Women  In Focus gallery [see Kinesis, Nov. 92]? I  contend that she and her work have been  trampled on. I also suggest that the internal  chaos in the organizational skills of that  gallery rendered them ineffectual and close  Queen's University  Campus Bookstore,  Kingston  The Book Tree,  Peterborough  Trent University  Bookstore,  Peterborough  Womansline Books,  London  Women's Bookstop,  Hamilton  Hi-Land News, Barrie  Toronto  A&S Smoke Shop  Another Story  Book City  DEC Bookstore  Glad Day  Bookshop  Lichtman's News &  Books  Longhouse Book  Shop  Maison de la Presse  Pages  Readers Den  Ottawa  Britton's Smoke  Shop  Globe mags and  Cigars  Mags & Fags  Ottawa Women's  Bookstore  Winnipeg  Bold Print  Co-op Bookshop  McNally Robinson  Booksellers  to hysteria. For example, a promise was  made part way through the exhibition's run  to at least open the gallery on Saturdays.  Even this didn't pan out because of a two-  hour mid-day lock-up lunch-break which  altered that schedule. With such spasmodic  hours, many many potential viewers could  not get in to see the paintings, think for  themselves, engage in some dialogue, read  some pertaining literature—in short, become  involved. In essence, Diana Kemble's works  were banned from public viewing.  One co-curator is quoted as saying, "...it  doesn't matter what culture she's drawing  from. This fascination with borrowing from  other cultures and mythologies indiscriminately hurts."  The artist has written that "these paintings call attention to cavity/cave, birth/bear,  woman/emergence." Apropos of what culture she is drawing from, what if a white  woman borrowed from ea rly Celtic imagery  yet herself was only 25% pure Celtic? Would  this be acceptable borrowing? Another: what  if an artist were part-Japanese, part-English,  part-French and part-Jamaican? A blend  takes only a few generations of many races  living in one country; this is happening in  Canada. Now, what will the board members  and committee at Women In Focus gallery  do about this mix? Mixed up? I am.  Agnes Huang's article "Women Out of  Focus" in the November issue of Kinesis read  as very balanced reporting around this very  controversial issue—in part, the gallery's  board members' response to an exhibition  going up on their own walls which they  didn't know enough about until it was up  and ondisplay.Whata mess they then found  themselves in. Curious that the focus has  been on the political dynamics and not on  the aesthetics of the work. No informed  reviews, no critical thought, no public attention. And almost all Kemble has said is "I am  working out of my dreams."  One irony is that Kemble was indeed  tentative, but for totally different reasons,  about displaying this particular series from  her life's work: the very graphic portrayals  of female sexuality, the dramatic brutality of  the torn vagina in childbirth, the intriguing  yet unutterable fear of giving birth to another species, the stories of animal and human copulation. This is all highly charged  imagery and found in the legends and mythologies of most every society. It is archetypal and no one single culture holds the  copyright to any of these experiences.  Moreso, when these stories are shared  between cultures, they often provide the  catalyst towards the following sort of exchange... "Yeah, well, in our family (read  culture), we had a similar story but it went  like this..."It is this mode of sharing, this sort  of dialogue and interaction for decades held  around kitchen tables, perhaps centuries  around woodstoves or f irepits that brings us  closer together.  To articulate why the leaves of a tree  have been painted purple may have some-  Alberta  Daily Globe Inc,  Calgary  A Woman's Place  Bookstore, Calgary  The Fourth Street  Bookshop, Edmonton  Hub Cigar &  Newstand, Edmonton  Nova Scotia  Atlantic News, Halifax  Blowers Street  Paperchase, Halifax  Red Herring Co-op  Books Ltd, Halifax  The Inside Story,  Greenwood  Newfoundland  Books for a Change,  St John's  Wordplay, St John's  British Columbia  Nelson Women's  Centre, Nelson  Tanners-A Bookstore  and More, Sidney  Everywoman's,  Victoria  Yates News & Books  Ltd, Victoria  Vancouver  Agora Co-op  Ariel Books  Banyen Books  Book Mantel  East End Food  Co-op  Hearts  Little Sister's  Manhattan Books  Mayfair News  Octopus Books  Pages and Pages  People's Co-op  Books  Peregrine Books  R2B2 Books  Spartacus Books  SFU Bookstore  Vancouver Women's Bookstore  Vancouver Lesbian  Connection  Women's Health  Collective  West Coast Books  UBC Bookstore  USA  Red and Black,  Seattle  thing to do with the French Impressionists'  theory of light, or a particular purple-leaf  tree of South Asia, or maybe with an emotional level the artist wants to convey, or it  might even relate to the fact that the artist has  run out of green paint.  But the adult artist will take the artistic  freedom to paint a sky red or a tree purple  whenever, much as the child artist will also  insist that sky can be red, that it doesn't  really have to be blue. And really, who is to  argue any of this? This is the explicit freedom of choice with regard to the color range  on the artist's palette.  Currently however, a conundrum is facing the artist with regard to the color rendering on the figure. The white artist, it seems  by the logic of some, can color the figure  white. The black artist can color the figure  black. The brown-skinned artist paints  brown-skinned figures.  All of the above is artistically inane and  obviously ludicrous. What sort of political  censorship will be issued on the creative act  and by whom? Have the 15th Century Italian paintings of Madonna and Child been  examined to determined if the color of flesh  on the palette was not appropriated from  another culture?  Who is Diana Kemble? Does she "work  (only) out of her dreams"? Why have these  been her only words with regard to her  paintings? How should this be considered?  For decades she has been an outspoken,  precise and witty proponent of womens'  issues, in particular inher support of women  artists. Her commitment to the arts spans a  real proficiency of literature and music, as  well as visual arts. She does respect her  subject matter. And what is important to me  is her sense of humanity.  Since money is a big part of race discourse (that is, funding agencies), let's make  it public: she is not federally funded, a remittance woman nor is she a pampered aristocrat. For decades, she has supported herself  as a part-time librarian. She has lived in the  Downtown Eastside of Vancouver for about  20 years (long before it was a fashionable  and arty pa rt of town). She shares the history  of repression and resistance; she is of a disenfranchised minority already (lack of recognition and lack of financial support for her  art) and these restrictions are all too familiar  to women artists.  My grave concerns are this: how easily  her art and her creative process have been  dismissed, how dialogue within the Women  In Focus gallery has been a 'no win' situation, how that communication may remain  suspect, impossible and closed. That the  willingness to celebrate imagination ("I am  working out of my dreams") and freedom  (the palette and its colours) of the artist has  been abolished.  Carole Itter  Vancouver, BC  No apology  from WIV?  Kinesis:  I found the response by Women In View,  to the feed back from Adonica Huggins on  racism at Women In View sadly lacking in  substance [see Letters, Kinesis, Mar. 93.]  Rather than reacting with that barrage  of statistics, a simple apology would have  been a good start.  We need less to deny and more to acknowledge how we have been influenced  and sometimes repeat patriarchal/imperialist attitudes toward race and class.  Politics between women is going  through a painful but necessary process. We  are in the throes of hard labour. Let's be  proud of our stretchmarks.

CALL FOR CONFERENCE PAPERS  This is a call for conference papers and  workshop proposals for a conference sponsored by the Centre for Research in Women's Studies and Gender Relations and the  School of Social work at the University of  British Columbia to take place Nov 18-20.  Poverty is a woman's issue which, like so  many others, also raises questions of other  forms of discrimination and privilege. The  Centre for Research in Women's Studies  and Gender Relations and the School for  Social Work believe that feminist perspectives on poverty help us to recognize and  confrontthese issues. This conference aims  to bring together anti-poverty and community groups with interested researchers in an  investigation of what feminist perspectives  mean for understanding poverty from childhood to old age. For the Saturday sessions  we are inviting community and academic  researchers to propose papers and workshops. Presentations may draw on completed studies or research in progress. We  are especially interested in work drawing on  new feminist scholarship, which recognizes  female diversity. The conference will close  late Sat afternoon with a 'Working Together"  panel, where invited researchers and community activists will explore, with the audience, the implications of feminist research  for a social justice policy agenda. Proposals  for Sat, including title, summary, and type of  presentation, together with mailing address  and telephone number should be sent, by  Apr 19 to: Centre for Research in Women's  Studies and Gender Relations, University of  British Columbia, 314-2206 East Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3.
