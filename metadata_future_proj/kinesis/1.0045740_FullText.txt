 July/August 1986  ^sjvotnen in musicjL  the politics of music  'women in country music Transition House  MHR denies funds for city  by Esther Shannon  Vancouver City Council received  word in late June that the provincial government will not  participate in funding a city-  run transition house for battered women.  Word of the province's rejection  came in a letter to council from  Ministry of Human Resources Min-'  ister Jim Nielsen, who wrote  that the province "is unable to  fund such a facility."  The city's proposal, which has  also been forwarded to the federal government, calls for the  establishment of a "residential  facility" which would provide  at least 15 beds, and an "advocacy centre" for advocacy and  court accompaniment services  for battered women.  The house itself would operate  in the traditional manner with  a confidential address but the  advocacy centre would be set  up separately "in a central  location accessible to the public." The city's proposal for  a separate advocacy centre is  a unique idea which formalizes  battered women's need for advocacy services.  According to the city, while  transition houses have always  done advocacy work "time  required has always been time  borrowed from the main activity  of running the house."  A separate advocacy service  would not be restricted to current and ex-residents but  would be i.open to "women who  may or may not need or use the  residence."  In his letter Nielsen advised  the city that "The ministry is  committed to opening an additional transition house for  ten residents in the lower  mainland. The Ministry's preference is to have this facility located in one of the  more suburban communities."  Nielsen went on to say that  the house "...will be available to women throughout the  lower mainland including Vancouver ."  Megan Ellis, spokesperson for  the Women's House Saving Action  (WHSA) told Kinesis  that Neil-  sen's decision "shows contempt  for women in Vancouver."  "The government's decision,"  said Ellis, "wasn't proceeded  by any serious negotiations  despite the fact that the need  for services is undeniable."  Gerry Fordyce, co-ordinator  of the Salvation Army's Kate  Booth House also expressed her  disappointment at the decision  saying "It's too bad really,  especially as there's no rhyme  or reason given."  According to Ellis there are  rumours that the new house is  to be established in White  Rock. "Clearly," said Ellis  "other houses are needed in  other areas but that shouldn't  preclude Vancouver having an  adequate number of beds for  battered women."  Fordyce says she's doubtful  that women in Vancouver would  use a house in the White Rock  area.  "Unless there was a special  need for protection," said  Fordyce, "they probably wouldn't  use it. Also, if it's in  White Rock it's going to cover  the Surrey area and Surrey itself is producing a lot of problems."  In an interview in the Vancouver  Sun  Alderperson Bruce Eriksen  said that "The government's  priorities are not to the people  of Vancouver. It's a slap to the  people of Vancouver."  According to Eriksen, Nielsen  "is so busy trying to take Mr  Bennett's chair that he's lost  touch with the important issues.  Megan Ellis says women must presi  the provincial government to  "re-think its decision." Asked  whether she thought the province could be persuaded to reverse its stance Ellis said  she really didn't know.  "You have to wonder," she said,  "if it's going to take some  woman being beaten to death  before it becomes politically  necessary to open more beds in  Vancouver."  PEI women lose only  hospital abortion committee  by Eunice Brooks  This month, in Prince Edward  Island, no woman can get a  legal abortion. The 24- member  board of directors of Prince  County Hospital in Summerside,  the only hospital which was  doing abortions in the province, dropped its abortion  committee in early June.  The committee wasn't up to  much. It had not approved an  abortion since October 1982.  Canadian Abortion Rights Action League (CARAL) spokesperson Diane Mossman said: "Women  knew that there was no use  asking for an abortion in PEI.  The committee was a farce."  It is estimated that 650 women  left PEI in 1985 for Dr. Henry  Morgentaler's clinic in Mont  real, or a clinic in Bar Harbor  Maine where they had to pay for  an abortion. Nova Scotia, the  neighboring province, does provide aboriton, but only for residents.  PEI women have been forced to  pay between $275 and $350 at  the Morgentaler Clinic, or  $250 in Maine, plus the cost  of transportation, according to  CARAL. Last spring, Dr. Morgentaler offered to start ;;up an  abortion clinic in PEI but the  Conservative government at the  time turned him down. The new  Liberal Health Minister, Keith  Milligan, will not make a  statement to the press on the  Morgentaler offer.  The federal government has no  plans to change Canada's abor-  New porn bill escalates  the censorship debate  by Elaine Liftman  It's been called fascist, puritanical and Victorian,  and  has raised a groundswell of  protest—and thus far,  little  wholehearted support.   It's the  proposed Criminal Code amendments to tighten pornography  laws—amendments critics fear  will lump together violent  porn and bestiality with nudity and kissing.  Justice Minister John Crosbie  presented a whole package of  sex legislation designed to  control the use of children in  porn and prostitution industries,   and to amend the hate  literature law to include sex,  but so far it has been eclipsed  by outrage over the porn bill.  The bill defines four types of  pornographic material involving adults: three are specifically linked to violence or  degradation, but the most contentious is a grocery list of  sex acts ranging from "vaginal,  anal or oral intercourse" to  "incest,  necrophilia..." and  ending with the catch-all .  phrase "other sexual activity."  Although this section has the  critics up in arms,  it will  probably be the first to go  if amendments are made.  Reaction from Vancouver feminists has split predictably, but  both pro and anti-censorship  forces object to the wording.  Opinion is also divided over  what will happen to the bill,  but most feel it will pass  with the most controversial  phrases revised.  Some,  however,  do not rule out its passage in  its current form,  especially  if there isn't strong protest  against the bill. Artist and  anti-censorship activist Sara  Diamond is one:   "It really  is a worst-case scenario of  what could happen with censorship lobbying," she said.   "It  shows that despite intensive  feminist lobbying,  the federal  government can't really differentiate between the clearly  Porn continued on page 8  Concern continues to be expressed among  Vancouver women about the appropriateness of patronizing the Lotus Hotel's women-  only disco because of fears that the hotel's  increased rents may have forced some low  income tenants to move. While the Lotus is  not on any group's hotel boycott list, the  newly formed Vancouver Lesbian Network  intends to discuss concerns about the Lotus  at a meeting slated for July 10th, 7:30 pm,  at 876 Commercial Drive (VLC).

Her  said Ottawa can't force prov- .  inces to provide abortions. He  said that women could always  leave the province if they needed an abortion. He did not take  into consideration that many  women live on the edge of poverty in PEI and cannot travel  due to a lack of funds.  Ottawa has been asked by women's  groups for more than a decade  to remove abortion from the  federal criminal code so that  it is no longer necessary to  get a hospital committee approval for a therapeutic abortion.  Crosbie says Ottawa will not  establish abortion clinics  simply because a certain province has no hospital with an  abortion committee.  Another CARAL spokesperson said  of John Crosbie's comments  that Ottawa can't interfere:  "That's interesting. The government here says it's a federal responsibility." She said,  that PEI Justice Minister,  Wayne Cheverie says it's up  to Ottawa to decide what to  do. Mossman said: "As long as  we've got the law it has to be  fairly applied. That isn't  happening in PEI."  The Prince County Hospital exec  utive director said: "It was  known by doctors they were  wasting time applying here, if  it wasn't a medical emergency.  The policy was only to permit  abortion in a life threatening  situation." He added: "The  board is representative of the  continued page 2. 2     July/ August TO Kinesis  msmw  Across BC      3  Immigrant women    4  Across Canada       6  AMARC           8  P4W       9  No Name Column 10  BC Nurses 11  International  News shorts 13  Lesbian conference  14  Music Supplement  Lillian Allen  16  Women playing 17  Country women 18  Women's Music Project  19  Cristina Gonzalez  | .. 21  Resisting Rip-off 22  Folkfest preview ...

Women's Tour  of Nicaragua  The first women-only tour of Nicaragua  from western Canada is well underway.  This two week tour is being organized  by the BC-Niearagua Coalition, Women's  section, and is expected to be in  Nicaragua by Sept. 25, 1986. The only  other women's tour of Nicaragua is  leaving Toronto this August.  While in Nicaragua, the tour will be  sponsored by the largest women's organization: AMNLAE. They will visit a  host of organizations, including prisons, hospitals, daycare centres and  . military organizations. This tour will  also coincide with AMNLAES anniversary  celebrations.  The tour of 16 women consists of photographers, filmmakers, journalists,  students, teachers, nurses, mothers,  lawyers and more. Upon their return  the women hope to continue solidarity  work with the women of Nicaragua by  presenting slide shows and talks, videos and hopefully produce a publication on the situation in Nicaragua.  In order to fully prepare for tour, the  women are meeting regularly to discuss  group process dynamics, and travel  arrangements and are being thoroughly  briefed on the history, culture and  politics of Nicaragua.  The tour also hopes to raise enough  money to subsidize expenses, especially  for those women who cannot pay the full  fare amount, estimated at $2,000. Therefore, tickets for a raffle draw are  presently being sold and benefits are  being planned.  Since information gathered in Nicaragua  by this tour will be brought back for  the women's community here in BC. Tour  members are asking feminists to support  the fundraising efforts.  If you are interested in assisting with  fundraising efforts or would like more  information on the tour, please call:  734-2228.  from previous page  community we serve, and we're responding  to concerns in the community."  There is only one abortion unit in Nova  Scotia, at Halifax's Victoria General  Hospital. That hospital will not accept  out of province abortions. To qualify  a person must be a resident of Nova  Scotia for three months. The hospital,  however, takes out of province surgery  patients for other procedures, such as  neurosurgery.  Canada has seen a serious drop in the  numbers of therapeutic abortion committees from 274 in 1975 to 244 by 1984. In  that year, 1984, for which the latest  statistics are available, only 34 hospitals performed 73 percent of Canadian  abortions. At 47 hospitals none were  performed.

We are given  the worst paid and lowest stat-  . us jobs. We are traditionally .  responsible for raising children and keeping house, whether  we like it or not.  All women in South Africa are  oppressed under the system of  apartheid. But black women  suffer the greatest burden of  oppression. They are three  times as oppressed because  they are women, black, and  workers.  On August 9th, 1956, 20,000  women representing millions  of women from all parts of South  Africa marched on the Union  Buildings in Pretoria to pro-"  test against the imposition  of the pass laws on African  women. Dressed in black, green .  and gold, the colours of the  African National Congress,  the disciplined and resolute  women stood in silence for  thirty minutes after the Prime  Minister refused to receive  the hundreds of thousands of  petitions the women brought.  The silent vigil was broken  by the singing of Nkosi  Sikelel and Africa Morena Bol-  oka. The delegates returned  home to intensify their resistance armed with a new freedom  songr •  Now you have touched the women \  you have struck a rock,  you have dislodged a boulder  you will be crushed'.  On Wednesday June 18th the  Southern Africa Women Against  Apartheid (SAWAA) met with  other women's groups to organize a celebration for August  9th, in Vancover. The celebration will be co-sponsored by  OXFAM.  We committed ourselves to making this day not only a day to  acknowledge the struggle of  women in South Africa but also  the struggles of our sisters  in British Columbia.  Present suggestions are that  we share experiences, films,  literature.and food. The day  will explore the commonality  of women's struggles in South  Africa and British Columbia.  With the aim of networking witl  women's groups in South Africa,  we can learn from each other  and help each other in our  mutual quests for women's liberation nationally and internationally.  We welcome all women's groups  and individual women to participate and attend our meetings  which will be held throughout  July.

Kelowna centre active but underfunded  by Lynn Corrigan  The delay of Secretary of State  operational funding grants for  women's centres is disrupting  our ability to serve the women  in our community. We've been  without paid staff since the  end of February when our rapid  growth caught up with us.  Calls, referrals, visits to  the centre and library circulation have all nearly quadrupled over the past year. So  we cautiously expanded another  200 square feet, doubling our  space. This,gave us enough  room for the four regular  office volunteers and five to  ten visitors a day. We had  to add another phone line to  handle the twenty to twenty-  five incoming and fifteen to  twenty outgoing calls each  day. We expanded hours, from  twenty per week to thirty.  Now both the new space and the  phone will have to be cut back  and we've already had to close  two■days■per week, cut ting  office hours back to eighteen  hours a week.  There is still work to do so  we drop by the office to pick  up work for home. Everytime  we do we find a woman on our  doorstep looking for information, help, a book, and wonder  where she and her sisters are  going when we're closed.  It's particularly galling to  be operatirig in limbo as the  work of years finally bears  fruit in the form of invitations to consult, take part in  community decision-making and  help plan development in several areas.  A member of our collective now  sits on the Okanagan College  Advisory Board, the Local Advisory Council to Canada Employment, and the Family Services Centre Board.  FASWOC finally wins improved contracts  The Food and Service Workers  of Canada (FASWOC) has emerged  victorious from their most  recent bargaining session with  Kentucky Fried Chicken of BC,  a division of White Spot.  The contract provides a signing bonus for all employees of  15j^ an hour for all hours  worked between September 1985,  when the last contract expired,  and May 31, 1986, with a  $50.00 minimum bonus per employee. There are three 15(^  per hour wage increases effective in January 1987, '88  and  '89 as well as some improvements in contract language.  Gloria Dean, president of  FASWOC Local 12 stated that  "the bargaining committee  believes that this is the  best settlement possible without considering strike action,  and the Bargaining Committee  is recommending acceptance of  the settlement offer." Voting  will take place in early July.  Their FASWOC sisters who are  employees of the White Spot  restaurant chain have also  settled a similar three year  contract recently, which provides a wage increase in each  year. A White Spot waitress  at the current job rate of  $6.75 an hour will earn $7.05  at the end of her second  year and receive one-half  the cost of living increase  in her third.  Relations with the company  have been strained since  White Spot imposed a contract  with a two-tier wage system  last winter. The impasse ended when FASWOC indicated  they would be increasing piib-  lie pressure by rallying \  their supporters from other  unions at the company's head  office to launch a BC Fed  boycott and picketting the  expo site where White Spot  has restaurants.  The union's bargaining committee is pleased that it  forced White Spot to remove  the clause that allowed mana^ .  gers to alter or cancel shifts  on short notice. FASWOCs new  contract stipulates that  management must provide at  least four hours personal  notice, and if a shift is  cancelled, another of equal  or greater length must be  provided. The seniority has  been strengthened to ensure  that^workers who indicate- ,  their availability will receive extra hours in order  of their seniority. .  Planning is underway with the  .Ministry of Human Resources  for a program for women who  have been receiving financial  assistance for five years or  longer, with Okanagon College  for pre-trades orientation  programs for women, and with  the school district for broader  career/vocational access for  high school women.  Despite the uncertainty and  the hardship caused by insufficient funding for our work,  we are in good spirits as a  result of the formation of  the BC, and Yukon Association  of Womens Centres at the 1986  Womens Centres Conference.  Another bright spot from the  conference was the request  for a Facilitator's Training  Course, "Working Together for  Change" (developed by North  Island Women's Services Society) from the Williams Lake  Women's Centre. We will be  offering a six-day course  there from July 20 to 25.  For registration information  call: Kate McDonaugh, 392-24-46  or write the Williams Lake  Women's Centre, Box 4094,  Williams Lake, V2G 2V2.  Programs being developed for  late summer and fall include  a five-day course for w°men  who want to start a small  business, a ten-session course  on intuitive management and  popular education methods in  business, workshops on handling  sexual harassment and on counselling women who have experienced it, communication  skills for immigrant women, and  assertiveness training course  that will be sponsored by the  Kelowna Multicultural Society.  We find ourselves betwixt and  between, working for change  while saddled with the same  old problems, excited by the  opportunities coming bur way  while frustrated by the lack  of energy,, time and funding  to take advantage of them. 4     July/Au  July/August TM> Kinesis  IMMIGRANT WOMEN  Conference focuses on employment issues  by Lena Warrington  Imagine yourself in a new country: you  are the only "different" person in the  city; you don't know the cultural do's  and don'ts, you have little money left  and very few friends. Having finally  arrived in the land of your dreams you  find that there are not jobs—and what's  worse, you don't speak the language well  enough to converse with employers. Would  you go into business for yourself under  those circumstances?  Over one hundred women from throughout  British Columbia attended the seventh  annual conference of the B.C. Task.  Force on Immigrant Women, held on May  23rd and 24th at Gordon Neighbourhood  House in Vancouver.  "Among the unemployed and their families is increased separation, div-.  oree, child abuse, wife abuse, children's  behaviour problems, and the employed  person themselves are more likely to  suffer from a variety of disorders....."  said Dr. Sue Penfold, Chair of Women's  Studies at Simon Fraser University.  She described the psychological stages  of unemployment as being initial  optimism, growing despair, chronic  resignation and bitterness.  Penfold, the keynote speaker, concluded  with a recommendation that our soc- ■  iety make massive changes, including  a shorter work week, male identity not  connected to success in employment and  reduction of stigma attached to unemployment .  The problem is, of course, what do you  do in the meantime? Social change is a  slow and painful process. Getting the  necessary help while you are under strese  is important, but judging from the experiences of the Panel of Immigrant  Women, they did not have the time or  the money.  Shaku Rashid, a teacher from India,  started a most successful business  with her husband to get away from her  boredom with being a full-time mother  and housewife.  Anna Yeung spoke of her language problems and lack of work experience. She  decided to go into business in Canada  by using her Hong Kong family connections to the fur business. "But," said  the soft-spoken young woman, "I have to  think ahead and work twice as hard as  men... I cook dinner in the morning or  night before to avoid conflict with  the family."  Paulet Oujuri, a black woman from Jamaica, gave example after example of job  interviews where racial prejudice may—  or may not—have been a factor. Still  unemployed, Oujuri is determined. "I  won't give up," she said.  The problems of coming to a new and  strange country are many: your qualifications may not be recognized; language courses are expensive, so you  stay in job ghettos; lack of daycare  funding forces women to stay home and  often opens them to exploitation from  cottage industry entrepreneurs. Depending on the category you're in, you may  qualify for welfare, but then can't take  courses; discrimination and a lack of  "Canadian experience" are often impossible hurdles.  "It's time we did it ourselves. Immigrant women have to organize; we have  to make the public aware of our special  needs in the labour force and small  business," said Khatun Siddiqi, chairperson of the Task Force. An English  language teacher at King Edward Campus  and herself from Tanzania, Siddiqi has  no illusions: "We have to promote a  dialogue with all three levels of government, promote networking and initiate programs. No one is going to do it  for us."  Donna Stewart from the National Action  Committee described their four million  volunteers from 460 women's 'groups  across Canada who act as a political  lobby. "Status of Women does the research, and we push," she said"emphatic-   ally. "We are not a minority in numbers—  only a minority in power and wealth.".  The Canadian Advisory Council on the  Status-of Women, represented by Kilby  Gibsons, stressed the importance of  having the facts and doing the research  before proposing legislation to the  government.  Elizabeth Lee of the National Immigrant  Women's Follw-up Committee, herself a  long-time member of the Task Force said  "Since 1981 we have lobbied the government. Immigrant women need a national  body. It is time for us to be more organized."  Much of Saturday was spent looking at  the. golden lining around the dark  clouds.''"' >*v>,--'  Judy Korbin from CP Air said they  were hiring now, and speaking other  languages was an asset. The Ministry  of Labour Women's Programs representative was Sandra Molloy. She reminded  everyone of the Pacific Rim's potential  one billion customers, where multiculturalism is a most decided asset. Also,  she continued, 80 percent of all future  jobs are in small business. While  women have a high success rate in business, access to English language training is "a big barrier to immigrants."  Marg Boyd, Assistant Secretary of the  Treasury Board, explained the Employment Equity Program. Women, native people,  the disabled and visible minority groups  need special help as these groups generally experience higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of pay than other  workers. "The federal government has  set their goals and the changes are being  monitored, but it will take time," she  said.  Liz Elliz from the Bank of Montreal and  Helen Hossick from the Federal Business  Development Bank gave sound advice on  business planning and financing, saying  that providing a service or starting a  cottage craft industry has a low initial  cash requirement. It was not until later  that anyone mentioned that two thirds  of all new businesses fail.  And what does one do if one's English  skills are poor? Vancouver Community  College offers an English as a Second  Language Course entitled "How To Start  a Small Business" and another ESL  course for women interested in selling  products they make at home. Alice Wong,  an instructor at the VCC King Edward  Campus, emphasized that if there are  twelve or more people who want a course,  VCC will provide a teacher, even to  outlying areas.  Reva Dexter of "Employment Equity Consultants" and Louise Gallarneau of  the CEIC Women's Programs described the  Canadian Jobs Strategy Program, stressing that more money was being made  available for women with daycare  needs and language training requirements.  At this juncture a woman from Kelowna  spoke out: "To qualify for job re-entry,  you have to be unemployed for three  years. Immigrant women do any work—  dishwashing, picking fruit, cleaning—  now we-don't qualify. Only rich women  who could stay home qualify." And a  young Guatemalan woman said: "I don't  speak English. I have four children and  welfare says I cannot take the course."  The past chair of the Task Force, Edith  Nee, struck a note of optimism: "There's  a really good momentum on immigrant  women's issues. We're at a critical juncture. How do we organize to become stronger? We have no real structure provincially,  and it's up to the women to do it ourselves."  This seemingly tall order was partially  realized at a Saturday workshop led by  Nee. Twelve women from various BC towns  and cities formed a working steering committee, complete with objectives and action  plan.  Afternoon workshops on Small Business, Employment, Affirmative Action and Organizing were led by Alice Wong, Eva Waldona,  Marianne Hoyd and. Edith Nee respectively,  to brainstorm solutions to specific problems.  "What exactly is the, relationship between  culture and employment?" asked Khatun Siddiqi  at the close of a long but stimulating conference. "Canada is a multicultural society,"  she continued, "and we have to consider cultural integration. We have expectations from  immigrants, but we also have to ask, what  do they have to offer us? What can Canadians learn from other cultures? We make  integration possible by giving choices  to  people, and for immigrant women to have  a choice, their needs must first be met."  The reality that immigrant women have  special problems apart from the mainstream  was indisputable by the,time the conference  drew to a close.  The B.C.

Kinesis July/August ^6   5  ACROSS BC  Women meet with MP to press social housing needs  The federal New Democratic  Party housing critic Dan Heap  recently spent three days in  the West gathering information  about local housing situations.  At a meeting, hosted by Little  Mountain Neighbourhood House,  representatives from over 15  groups involved in work on  women's housing needs talked to  Heap.  In future the federal government will take responsibility  for only native housing (both  on and off reserves) and co-ops.  In BC this has caused alarm  among special needs groups.  Women at the meeting expressed  dismay over the transfer citing two major reasons.  First they wondered if the BC  government will do the same  thing with housing money that  they did with education funding. The entire federal education payment to BC went into  provincial government general  revenues, and only a portion  of it was spent on education  leaving BC's post-secondary  education system iseriously  underfunded.  The second fear expressed by  women was that the Social Credit government is on record as  saying that there is no housing problem in the province.  They have no inclination to  construct social housing in  BC but would, if pushed, do  something about people's housing problems, preferably a  system of rental subsidies.  This approach means that housing monies are transferred  directly to landlords.  Many women were also 'alarmed at  the-thought of the provincial  government administrating  social housing programs. Again  and again women stated the  need for control of the programs by non-profit groups.  Women pointed out that it's hard  to imagine the Social Credit  government dealing fairly or  even adequately with the housing needs of women released  from prison and mental institutions, of street women, battered women, and sole support  women including single mothers,  lesbians and older women.  Many women representing support  groups underlined the need for  . ancillary services along with  housing. Women need housing  but many also need, under the  same roof, childcare, education  and job readiness programs,  counselling and support services.  The women urged Heap to press  the federal government to release funds for 1986 social  housing programs, but cautioned  that before transferring funds  to the provinces the government  should demand that basic  standards of control and maintenance by non-profit groups  be established.  One woman told Heap to return  to Ottawa and ask where the  money is going to go, since  1986 is half over and social  housing programs aren't even  beginning to be constructed.  In some areas of Canada, for  instance in the north, the  building season is almost over.  Nationally many groups have  Judge denies publication  ban on rape victim's name  by Eunice Brooks  A request that is usually granted automatically was refused  last month in a Vancouver  court. Judge Stephen Harding  insisted that Prosecutor Craig  Dykes have a persuasive reason  for banning publication of a  victim of rape. The application  was opposed by the defence  lawyer for the two men on trial,  Dennis Kontonis and Christopher  Douthwaite.  They were each charged separately with sexually assaulting  the same woman on August 9,  1984.  Judge Harding said: "A full  and fair report of proceedings  includes the names of parties  in the proceedings. It  strikes me as an extraordinary  provision I am being asked to  invoke, that on request I  should make an order banning  publication of such information." His ruling was made in  absence of a jury.  The case will not be heard  until the fall. Dykes indicated a new application may be  made at that time to ban publication of the complainant's  name, or any information that  would tend to identify her.  lost land they were holding  in expectation of forthcoming  funds. For many women, the  primary consumers of social  housing, this isn't just an  opportunity lost, it's a waste  of years of volunteer work  and planning.  Heap urged women to contact  Pat Carney (Member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre)  and make their demands heard,  asking her to represent women  in Cabinet.

The  Supreme Court of Canada refused to grant the Ontario Hockey Association (OMA) leave  to appeal an Ontario court  rilling which struck down as  unconstitutional a law that  prohibited her from playing  in a hockey league because  of her sex.  Blainey's next step is to  file a discrimination complaint  against the OMA with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. .  After 13 months of legal challenges she still does not know  whether she will be allowed  to play hockey.  According to Blainey's lawyer, Joan Gilmour, a complaint  has been laid with the Human  Rights Commission but the  NAC meeting demands  free trade referendum  Over 500 women representing more  than 450 women's groups met in  Ottawa in late May for the  annual general meeting of the  National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC).  The weekend meeting was followed by NAC's traditional daylong lobby of the three federal  political parties.  The theme of this year's meeting  was "organizing for power" in  recognition of the fact that  women's concerns, regardless of  how just or reasonable they are,  are too often ignored by politicians.  According to NAC, women must  consider innovative political  strategies and concrete actions  which groups can undertake,  both locally and nationally  to demonstrate that the  women's movement is a powerful force that cannot be ignored.  Participants attended workshops on a wide variety of  issues, including right wing  women, going forward with  native women, free trade and  pornography. Delegates passed  resolutions demanding a national referendum on free trade,  which NAC fears will endanger  jobs and social programs for  women, and called for action  on other issues, including  full indexation of family  allowances, family violence,  services for immigrant and  visible minority women, access  to abortion, protection from  discrimination on the basis  of sexual orientation and  sanctions against South Africa,  among others.  At the lobby, attended by over  300 women, NAC representatives  reminded Conservative MPs that  in the last election they  promised legislation to require  equal pay for work of equal  value and mandatory affirmative action programs and that  the lack of government action  in these areas is "disappointing."  The Conservative cabinet ministers at the lobby promised  to announce concrete measures  on family violence and to  work towards more uniform  access to abortion across the  country, (see abortion in PEI  page one).  However, they offered little  of substance on other issues.  According to Louise Dulude,  acclaimed as the new NAC president at the meeting, NAC  will "continue to lobby for  change...the Conservatives  will have to understand that  if they want to get re-elected  they will have to listen to  timing of a hearing depends  on hurdles, such as adjournments, placed in the way of  the proceedings. Gilmour said  she hopes the discrimination  complaint is ruled on by the  time the hockey season starts.  According to Blainey, while  the successful decision is,  "wonderful", the entire process "takes way too long."  She says she will continue  to fight because it's important for women's equality but  mainly because she loves the  game.

Access to abortion restricted  due to Ontario doctors strike  Press Gang Printers  603 Powell St., 253-1224  Therapeutic abortion committees  in five Ontario hospitals have  been disbanded as a result of  a strike by the province's  doctors. The doctors, on strike  for over three weeks, have with-  withdrawn all but emergency  services to protest Ontario's  new laws banning extra billing.  A recent Globe and Mail  poll  found that 77 per cent of  Ontario residents disagree  with the doctors' action.  Ontario's health ministry has  asked the Toronto-based  /Women's College Hospital to  increase the number of abortions it performs until the  disbanned committees are reestablished. The health ministry's request generated  controversy when it was rum-  ured that physicians were  being offered double the  usual rate for abortions.  According to Dr Henry Morgentaler the doctors' strike has  also necessitated extended  hours at his Toronto abortion  clinic which, he said, has  been "flooded" with women  who. have been turned away  . from hospitals. The Morgentaler clinic will now be  opened on Saturday to "meet  the demand".  Pro-choice activists are outraged at the withdrawal of the  the abortion committees,  charging that it "shows the  fragility of access to abortion in the province when a  few doctors can deny access  to abortion."  Meanwhile anti-abortionists  are continuing their efforts  to put pressure on the Ontario government to close  the Morgentaler clinic.  Reverand Ken Campbell, the  head of Choose Life Canada,  has recently embarked on a  hunger strike as another  way to gain attention.  Campbell lost a bid recently  to proceed with the criminal  charges against Ontario  Attorney General Ian Scott  for refusing to close Mbr-  gentaler's clinic.  In November 1984 Dr Morgentaler and two associates were  acquitted by a jury on charges  of conspiring to procure a  miscarriage. The Crown appealed and 11 months later the  Ontario Court of Appeal threw  out the jury's decision and  ordered a new trial.  Morgentaler has appealed this  decision to the Supreme Court  of Canada which will hear the  case in the fall.  Pension changes  A bill to amend the Canada Pension Plan and provide mandatory pension credit splitting  on divorce or after a separation of at least one year was  given all party approval in  parliament late last month.  The bill, which implemented a  federal-provincial agreement  reached in December, received  unanimous approval on the final reading and was sent to the  Senate for approval.  Changes to the Canada Pension  Plan Act require the approval  of two-thirds of the provinces  representing two-thirds of the  population. The changes on pension-splitting will come into  effect on Jan. 1, assuming  enough provinces agree by that  date 'Ģ S!lrf>sS- *  In another amendment to the  CPP act, widows or widowers  will no longer lose their survivors pensions when they remarry, and an estimated 35,000  people who lost benefits in  the past will have them reinstated as of January.  Mandatory pension-splitting  had been informally agreed to  by the federal and provincial  governments last December.  When the amendments were finally tabled in the spring, however, the mandatory pension-  splitting was dropped. Renewed  lobbying by the National Action Committee on the Status  of Women ensured that the  pension-splitting provision  was re-introduced. Kinesis July/August H6   7  ACROSS CANADA  DisAbled women win NAC support  e&  graphic by Joucette  by Joan Meister  Approximately a year ago, the  DisAbled Women's Network  Canada (DAWN CANADA) was formed  by disabled women from all across  the country. More recently, DAWN  BC held its founding conference  in British Columbia, joined the  National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) and sent  Shirley Masuda and myself to  NAC's annual general meeting.  The AGM sessions and workshops  stressed actions to empower  women in the coming year. The  first day had sessions on organizational skills and NAC's main  issues. These provided an overview of NAC's philosophy, practices and concerns. The second  day included reports, candidates'  speeches and afternoon workshops which had the overall  perspective, "What Actions Can  I and My Group Undertake in  the Coming year...".  This series of workshops included many interesting subsections  which ranged from "To Fight  Against Free Trade, Privitiza-  tion and Deregulation" to "To  Go Forward Together with Native  Women" and, "To Abolish Sexual  Harassment from the Workplace"  to "To Eradicate Incest".  DAWN CANADA led one of these  workshops: "To Integrate Disabled Women into the Mainstream".  Pat Israel and Joanne Doucette  from Toronto, Maria Barille  from Montreal and I faciliated  the discussion. This session was  attended by several Ottawa  women with disabilities and  provided a fourm for a discussion of the origins of DAWN  Study shows  female students  moving up  A newly released two-year  study of Ontario students shows  that girls are making better  progress than boys. In advanced  pre-university classes, the  majority are girls. Girls are  consistently achieving higher  marks.  At Queen's University 55 percent of undergraduates are  female, and this is expected  to rise as those in high  school now move up. The number  of girls at grade 9 level planning to go to university is  twice that of boys.  The reports show girls still  avoiding mathematics, sciences, and computers. The girls  demonstrate lower self-esteem  than boys.  The report also showed that  male and female students whose  parents were born in China,  Hong Kong, India and Pakistan  got the highest marks. Most  students like and respect  their teachers. The report  also showed that more career  guidance is needed in Ontario  Globe and Mail  and our reasons for participating in NAC. The non-disabled  women who attended the session  offered their support in various forms such as acquiring  letters of support from their  organizations for grant applications .  DAWN CANADA was formed in response to the need for disabled  women to find a voice of our  own with which to define and  share concerns, first with each  other and then with others. We  felt that neither the disabled  consumer's movement nor the  women's movement had begun to  understand or address issues  of specific interest to women  with disabilities from the  point of view of women with  disabilities. These are issues  such as sexuality, assertive-  ness, parenting, affirmative  action, and accessibility to  the women's movement and to  services and resources for  women. The workshop in Ottawa  helped us to view and clarify  our concerns from a broader  perspective.  Another important aspect of  the NAC AGM for disabled and  non-disabled women alike was  the passage, at the business  meeting the following day, of  two emergency resolutions submitted by DAWN B.C.. The resolutions also received prior  approval of DAWN CANADA. They  first read as follows:  WHEREAS disabled women face  economic,  employment, transportational,  health,  educational,  housing,  communication and  social handicaps, and  WHEREAS the women's movement  has failed to reach out to  disabled women or support us  in fighting to eliminate these  handicaps,  BE IT RESOLVED THAT NAC begin to work with the DisAbled  Women 's Network and/or other  disabled women to develop and  carry out strategies for overcoming these handicaps,  and  BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT  NAC urge all member groups  to contact DAWN and/or other  disabled women in their  communities and determine how  they can best lend support  to their disabled sisters.  The second resolution addressed  access and was passed,as follows:  WHEREAS most women 's events,  services and resources are  inaccessible to women with  disabilities,  BE IT RESOLVED THAT NAC urge  member groups to make accessibility (including but not  limited to such things as  utions also received prior      limited to such things as happen in 1'  Ontario gays a step closer to protection  by Eunice Brooks              Bm ? camot be voted on in    Attorney Genei  Don't start celebrating yet.

In addition to these two important resolutions receiving approval by the NAC membership, Pat Israel (DAWN  TORONTO) was elected to the  NAC Board of Directors as  a Member at Large. Now,  disabled women are assured  of a continuing voice and  an ongoing opportunity to  contribute to the decision  making level of the national  women's movement.  It would seem that for disabled women, the theme of  the 1986 NAC AGM has already  ' started to become a reality.  DAWN, together with the rest  of the women's movement in  Canada, is prganlzaing for  power and making things  happen in 1986.  by Eunice Brooks  Don't start celebrating yet  The omnibus bill to bring  Ontario statutes into line  with the Canadian Charter of  Rights, Bill 7, still has to  struggle through the legislature, but there is a good  chance for sexual orientation.  Bill 7, when passed, will add  sexual orientation to the  Ontario Human Rights Code.  The amendments were proposed in  committee by MLA Evelyn Gigantes  (NDP-Ottawa Centre).  On May 6, the Coalition for Gay  Rights held a press conference  at the provincial legislature  to present members with a brief  entitled Discrimination Against  Lesbians and Gay Men:  The  Ontario Human Rights Commission.  Speaking on behalf of the  coalition was Christine  Bearchell.  She said: "The Ontario government 's ommission of sexual  orientation from Bill 7 is a  disappointing and glaring one.  We can only assume that the  Liberals are in favor of discrimination of lesbians and  gays."  Earlier briefs had been presented in 1975, 1978 and 1981.  When this new amendment was put  to a vote in the standing committee to consider Bill 7,  there were 8 in favor and  2 opposed, both PCs, MLA Peter  Partington (Brock) and MLA  Nobel Villenueve (Stormont-  Dundas-Glengarry).  Bill 7 cannot be voted on in  the legislature clause-by-  clause because it is an omnibus bill. None of the MLAs  outside the committee would  comment to the press on how  they meant to vote, but it  should be noted that ill the  Liberals on the committee voted  yes. In Ontario Liberals are  the government.  Attorney General Ian Scott  was unavailable for comment.  But, in his speech at the  opening session of the session of the standing committee he stated: "Bill 7 is  concerned only with discrimination on already recognized  grounds such as sex, age,  marital status, and disability.  Quebec housing study  In Montreal, the Comite  Logement Rosemont has recently completed a survey of women  in rental housing who live  with discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment.  297 women were surveyed. Half  reported harassment during  the past 4 years.  Sixty-eight of the surveyed  women (86 percent of those  on welfare) had been victims  of discrimination, and 40  percent of harassment. Reasons  for refusal of housing were  unclear to the victims. Landlords question women about  civil status, bank account  numbers, welfare/work status,  and number of children.  The five types of discrimination are: having children  (12 percent), being on welfare  (11.5 percent), being a woman  (10.1 percent), being a young  person (9.7 percent), and  being a single mother (7.6 percent ).  Harassment can be intimidation,  such as prying into the tenant 's personal life ( 23 percent)  surprise visits (15.5 percent),  or insults and threats (10.8  percent). It can also be sexual harassment, leering (15.5  percent), fondling (1.7 percent) and other approaches.  Seventy-seven of those harassing are landlords, while  another 23.2 percent are neighbours . Because they feared the  situation, only 12 percent of  the women harassed have made  any official complaints. 22  percent of the surveyed women  had not previously known that  Quebec has a Rental Board for  their protection.  In Montreal 85 percent of tenants are single parents.  The survey report is available  from the Comite Logement Rosemont,   3895 '3rd Avenue, Montreal,  HI J 2X2.

The world will find out at the  upcoming Second World Conference of  Community Oriented Radio Broadcasters,  July 25-29 in Vancouver, BC.  The conference, known by its French  acronym AMARC 2y will play host to some  400 delegates from every continent who  will discuss issues of mutual concern,  exchange technical information, and set  up international networks. Women's issues  have been targetted as a primary focus  for the event.  "Community radio is the only place where  women from the grassroots have been  able to get access to the airwaves,"  says Helen Dixon of the Agenda Committee. "This means that women can speak  for themselves about issues that concern them. We can broadcast on a range  of issues to a wide community of women,  and we can address specific feminist  issues of interest to women already  organized into the feminist movement.  We also have space to broadcast cultural work by women.  "AMARC 2 will bring together women programmers from a wide variety of contexts where the ways in which radio  is being done can also tell us about  how women are organizing in their communities."  Representation is expected from the  full spectrum of community radio stations: listener owned and operated; \  campus stations; Native broadcasters;  European free radio; development radio  from the Third World; women's radio;  and guerilla radio, like Radio Farabun-  do Marti of El Salvador, or Radio Freedom, the station of the African National Congress.  Women from across this spectrum will be  at AMARC 2: Radio Raquel, an entirely  women-run station from Norway. Formed  in 1982, the station has taken courageous stands on several women's issues,  and come under fire from the government for its controversial broadcasts  on prostitution.  ...GORADEP, the community radio organization in Nicaragua, which broadcasts programming aimed at rural women  that has a primarily educational focus.  ...North American Native women .who are  involved in stations that hold together  isolated Native communities.  ...And women from the listener-owned  coalition stations like the host,  Vancouver Cooperative Radio (CFRO-102.7)  who put together feminist programming  in the context of larger stations committed to broad social change and alternative culture.  Conference organizers have placed a  strong emphasis on acquiring travel  subsidies to offer to women broadcasters, and on ensuring equal participation on all panels. Workshops with specifically feminist content include:  "Where to for women broadcasters after  the UN decade for women?" "What models  exist for encouraging programming by  and for women?" and "Reaching women in  non-mainstream communities."  There is space on the agenda for regular caucussing among women, and a women's plenary is scheduled for the  Interested Lower Mainland women may want  to attend "Sounding Out: Community Radio  at Work" a forum designed to introduce  community radio to the public, on Sunday  July 27th at 7:30 pm.

The public backlash has led many observers  to declare the extreme portions of the bill  a token gesture to the right wing fundamentalists, in the Conservative party. Crosbie,  they say, doesn't expect it to pass as it  stands.  "I'm hoping that as a politician, he can't  afford to anger this group," says anti-  porn activist Jancis Andrews. "He can bring  forward this bill, and it will be thrown  aybe that's what he's banking on. He  ns a "golden boy" between the two  lies—those who want everything banned,  and the civil libertarians." Andrews  hoped the final bill resembles the 1985  Fraser Committee recommendations.  But Diamond thinks the bill's references  to "degrading" sex is as much of a token  to the feminist lobby as the broad sex  classification is to the Tory right. The  real issue, she says, is the state's role  in "shaping.our sexuality." Diamond main-  that censorship does not serve the  ist community.  Ellis of the Working Group on Sexual  nee is one of those who doubts the  will pass. As it reads, she says, it  contravene the Charter of Rights,  so far Crosbie seems to be standing  behind it. I think they'll let it sit for  a while. I think they'd be wasting their  time (to take it to committee). But who  knows?" Ellis supports a Canadian version  of the "Dworkin-McKinnon ordinance," giving women the right to sue pornographers  for damage. For her, overhauling the  obscenity laws serves less purpose than  examining rape, incest and child sex-  assault legislation.  A more positive reaction comes from the  Anglican Church's Task Force on Pornography  .Although they are concerned with the "open-  endedness" of the language, "on the whole  we're very happy in terms of specific  named areas, such as violent activity and  bestiality," said Margaret Marquhardt, who  prefers the term "restrictions" over  "censorship". She feels most areas are  clearly defined, and isn't too concerned  about misinterpretation. "The bill will go  to committee',  there will be enough submissions and debate to clear up the vague  language. I think it will pass. There's  enough support, enough feeling that this is  a grave, important issue."  Although both Marqhardt and Andrews claim  the list of sex acts is clear enough to  avoid confusion, they are quick to offer  their own clarifications. The ban on "ejaculation" images is aimed at scenes where  "a man is ejaculating in a woman's face,"  Marqhardt said. And Andrews, reading from  the Canada Customs guidelines' she favours,  explains a restriction on "artificial  phalli" is to prevent "showing women shoving cucumbers and bananas up their insides."  Confusion could be eliminated here, she  suggests, by making an exception for "material recognized as a legitimate sexual  aid by a sexual therapist."  Crosbie's appearance at a University Women's  Club luncheon in March gave no indication  of the coming bombshell. He was asked about  the Fraser Report, and the inclusion of sex  under the hate propaganda section of the  criminal code. "I didn't get any sense that  he wanted to see a crackdown on erotic  imagery," Marqhardt said.  The hate literature amendment has produced  mixed feelings. "It's a step because it  acknowledges that real hatred can be directed  towards women," Andrews said. Ellis, however,  is doubtful about its usefulness. "There  have been almost no prosecutions under the  hate literature section in Canada. It would  depend on the provinces, on having a progressive attorney general, interested prosecutors. ..'.'  Whatever happens to the bill, feminists who  don't believe it's the answer will continue  working for sex education, alternative erotic images, or another area of the Criminal  Code they consider more effective. Those  with hopes for the new legislation must wait  and see how it looks when and if it passes—  1986 at the earliest—and how it is enforced  if it does become law. Kinesis July/August TJ6   9  PRISONS  P4W Inmate Committee's warnings ignored  by Karen Gram  The Kingston prison for women has never  been a very relaxed environment, but  since January when two women were transferred from protective custody into the  general population, tension has risen  dramatically.  Protective custody is the area in prisons reserved for prisoners who have  committed crimes morally repugnant to  the other prisoners and whose lives would  be threatened in the general population.  Most protective custody women committed  crimes against children. Their exact  crimes are confidential so the prison  population simply assumes the worst  of any one who has ever been in protective custody.  The two women who were transferred,  requested the move but the inmate committee who represents the prisoners  urged the prison administration to deny  the request because of the negative  impact on the general population.  "Our grave concern is that a time bomb  is ticking here. It may appear peaceful on the surface today but next week  or three months from now, someone is  going to get seriously hurt," said the  inmate committee in a letter to the  editor of the Kingston Whig Standard.  The inmates are angry about several  things. First, that women who have  probably killed children are in their  midst, second, that these women just  by their presence provoke  violence which results in  charges being laid against  prisoners who otherwise  would have avoided the  trouble, and third, that  the women have been moved  into the most privileged  wing in the prison.  All this exacerbates an  already tense situation.  One recent prisoner at P4W;  who.was transferred out  three weeks after the two  protective custody women  joined the general population, said Security started  hassling prisoners about a  week after the transfer.  "One girl was charged with not being  in her cell by 11 pm and-lost a visit  with her old man." Said the former  inmate who requested anonymity because  she feared for her job! She said the  woman had loudly protested the protective custody move.  Another woman was charged with having  a dangerous weapon in her cell. The  weapon was a fork she was using to hold j  up a plant.  "When I left that place there was a lot  of tension," said the former prisoner.  "The only way to stay cool was to take  drugs, fall in love, and play music.  You had to stay high."  To protest, the inmates have held •  sit-ins and refused to eat,, work or  study with the protective custody  women.  One of the protective custody women  was badly_ beaten, twice in one day  • when prisoners caught her away from  her guard.  Monique Hall, another recent transfer  from P4W, said the two protective custody women were often hit in passing.  "You had to be pretty fast though."  She added there was also quite a lot of  verbal intimidation.  Despite the prisoners' concerns, Warden George Carron approved the transfer and has consistently refused to  reconsider his decision. In an interview, he dismissed opponents to the  integration saying they are a "small  group of aggressors who don't have  the will of the population behind  them. These two women are trying to  make it out in the population and  it's not easy for them. There are  some inmates with very little gray  matter," said Carron.  When asked if he thought the protective custody women would be scapegoats for these "aggressors" he  replied, "we have stabbings and beatings in here all the time, and it's  not just the protective custody women  who are attacked. They attack anyone."  Carron refused to permit interviews  with prisoners until a full year had  passed.  Bev Whitney, a former prisoner at  P4W, said the members of the inmate  committee are elected by the prisoners and represent all the areas in  the prison. She said hostility toward  the protective custody women is wide  spread because so many of the.regular  prisoners were abused as kids.  Whitney said even, prisoners who don't'  hate protective custody inmates would  be angry about the transfer because  they were moved to the wing.  A time bomb is ticking here.  Everything may appear  peaceful on the surface  but someone is going to  get seriously hurt.  "The Wing used to be a cool place to  be but now it's not even cool to  smoke dope in there because the protective custody women are there (and  their guards). They are turning a privileged area into another protective  custody" said Whitney.  Karen Howe, coordinator of community programs for the Kingston Elizabeth Fry Society, said three quarters of all the  women she has talked to expressed concerns  about the integration. She said she is  sure the inmate committee speaks for all  the prisoners because prisoners are very  sensitive about being misrepresented and  wouldn't tolerate it.  Whitney said she believes protective custody is necessary because "people have  the right to live out their sentences."  She doesn't think candidates for protec- ■  tive custody should be given the option  to refuse protective custody because it  is unfair to the prison population and  dangerous to the women who refuse the  protection.  "If they aren't killed they are beaten  very, very seriously," she said. Whitney,  said she doubts these, two women will live  to the end of summer.  Carron said the two women knew the risks  involved before transferring.  "You have to understand the dynamics of  the situation. These inmates were faced  with double bunking in a little box and  said they wanted out. They asked to take  their chances."  Karen Howe said she thinks the two may  have been pressured by the prison administration to transfer. "I think they were  told if you get out we'll have some  available space here."  Prisoners in protective custody lead very  restricted lives. The wing is very small  and crowded and they spend all but two  hours each day locked in. They can  only use the gym once a week whereas  others can use it everyday, and can only,  exercise outside for one hour each day.  Their meals are brought to them on trays.  Library use is restricted to once a week  for two hours. If they want to study a  teacher will visit, them but only twice a  week compared to full time for the others.  Work is limited to an upholstery shop.  Howe said every concession that is made  to provide protective custody women with  better access to prison services restricts the general population's access  because when the protective custody's are  in an area, the others must not be.  "It causes resentment,"she said. "It's  like forcing someone who gets one meal a  day to share it with someone else."  Claire Culhane, a prison abolitionist for  •many years, said she is not surprised  the system is encountering problems  now. She says they should never have  created protective custody in the  first place because it divides the  population.  "All it has done is set up a peeking  order for prisoners, once you're in  protective custody you are marked for  life. You are at the bottom of the  barrel."  Karen Howe agrees. "There has always  been a moral code in the prisons but  the prison administration bought into  that code when they created a protective custody wing. They reinforced that  code."  "We're going to have to find a way to  break down that anger but I don't  think the method they chose.was the  appropriate one."  At a recent general meeting, the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry  Societies passed a resolution which  recommends one possible solution.  They suggest that protective custody  wings be expanded to provide adequate  space for all the prisoners and that  prisoners be given access to social,  health, vocational, spiritual, and  pre-release programs in response to  demonstrated needs.  Executive director of CAFS, Carol  Faulkner, said the prison should also  always consult the inmate committee  before moving protective custody  prisoners into the general population  or introducing child abusers directly  into the population.  "If the inmate committee says no way,  they should listen," said Faulkner.  For Claire Culhane there is no solution.  She says they created a monster when  they established the protective custody  area and no reform will solve the problems it created. "That's why I'm an  abolitionist," she said. 10 July/ August *86 Kinesis  by Sylvia Arnold  Vancouver...B.C....the mountains, the  ocean, the forests; an outdoor haven.  They're just minutes away, yet can seem  so unattainable.  They can seem unattainable especially  for women; be it due to real barriers -such  as lack of skills or childcare, or due  to the myths that outdoors exploration  is only for the super-fit or competitive.  The Vancouver Outdoor Club for Women was  formed to counter those barriers and  myths—to make the outdoors attainable  for women. In existence for seven years,  the club sees its purpose as to offer  to women an opportunity to learn skills,  and to share the excitement of the outdoors in a friendly, non-competitive  atmosphere.  One of the important aspects of the club  is its emphasis on skill sharing. Women  do not need to have any outdoor skills to  join. Of the forty or so women who are  members, some are skilled while others  are not. Maureen Holt, a member of the  club, laughingly told me that previously  when she would go hiking she would bring  nothing, not even a water bottle. Since  joining she has learned to backpack. "It's  a very good group for exchanging skills,  I picked up a lot," said Holt.  Equally important is the club's noncompetitive structure which puts as  first priority enjoyment of the outdoors.  Jan de Grass, a member for a year and a  half in the club, praised the fact that  there was no real push in the activities.  "I wouldn't have joined a club full of  Phys. Ed. nuts," she said, and added  "we eat a lot."  Outdoor Club  promotes friendly,  non-competitive  atmosphere  The club is an eclectic group, coming as  Holt said "from every different kind of  lifestyle." Sometimes women can share  their city responsibilities so that they  can be able to go on the weekend trips.  For example, one such member, a mother,  is looking for a second who will alternate  childcare responsibilities with her.  The club's activities include hiking,  canoeing, kayaking, cycling, mountain  climbing, horse-back riding, skiing...  they exclude next to nothing. A glance  through some of the club's monthly newsletters revealed trip reports on a bike  tour of Vancouver that culminated in Dim  Sum; hikes in the International Women's  Day and Peace marches; an overnight ski  camping trip to Pemberton meadows, rock  climbing in Lighthouse park, and an Easter  retreat.  Twice a year they get together to schedule  events. "That gives members a chance to  plan" de Grass said, but added that trips  also arise spontaneously. The club has a  loose structure, and depends on the imput  of members to initiate trips. Each trip  is lead by a member so that members can  learn leadership skills.  Annual membership rates are on a sliding  scale, ranging from $15-$30. Fees are used  for the most part for purchasing equipment.  Major items such as tents, packs and camp-  stoves can be borrowed from the club's  equipment.depot. "We try to keep costs  down," said Holt.  Monthly meetings are held to plan trips, as  well as to share information and socialize.  Those meetings have included members sharing first aid, photography and camping  nutrition skills, as well as slideshows.  De Grass said she's amazed to see how the  women really volunteer and are enthusiastic  in the club. She reasoned that it is probably because "there's no real pressure,  since it's for our own enjoyment."  So for the women in the Vancouver Outdoor  Club the mountains, ocean and forests are  attainable.  The club's friendly, the club's fun. It's  also liberating. Their club manual ends  with this inspiring quote from Simone de  Beauvoir:  Let her swim,  climb mountain peaks,  pilot  airplanes,  battle against the elements,  take risks, go out for adventure,  and  she will not feel before the world .   .   .  timidity.  If you're interested in joining the club,  they meet the first Tuesday of every  month at the CRS on Odium Street. It's  best to phone Linda at 876-3506 to confirm  though.  by Nora Randall  Fate is twisted. I first went to the  South Vancouver Neighbourhood House  Immigrant Women's Group to talk to the  women about their experiences of coming  to Canada for the Women's Voices play I  was working on. The group had such incredible stories that I wanted to keep  in contact with them some way. So when  the volunteer English teacher quit and  another one couldn't be found to replace  her, I said I'd do what I could. My  only qualifications for this task were  that I speak English (as an only language ) and that I know other women who  know how to teach English. This is  pretty thin, I admit, but I was better  than nothing which is what they had.  Those first classes provided the women  with more entertainment than English,  but we all persevered. Which is why I  was there when the group leader had  to move to Saskatoon and we weren't  sure how we would go on. We were only  sure that we wanted to go on.  The thing that made the group leader  so important besides the fact that  she's a wonderful woman is that she is  the only person in the group fluent  in English and Punjabi. Half of the  group spoke little or no English, and I  speak no Punjabi. I decided that what  we needed was another volunteer who  spoke Punjabi and English.  Of course, it would be a lot better  to hire a worker who speaks Punjabi  and English which is what they really  need, but the city cut the funding for  immigrant programs and the appeal is  just coming up. (It's this little niggling bit of information that took the  sparkle out of the Centennial fireworks  display for me.) So it had to be a  volunteer.  I asked a friend who told me to call  a friend and she called a friend she  knew and pretty soon a woman who speaks  Punjabi and English called me up and  offered to come meet our group.  She turned out to be terrific. Not only  did she speak Punjabi and English so  our group could continue, but she also  was willing to help with the cooking for  the ethnic lunch so it looked like our  group could save the ethnic lunch from  . extinction too.  This is how we did it. I asked Gurmail  if she'd ask Surjit if she was willing  to continue cooking the ethnic lunch.  Surjit said sure, Gurmail said she'd  help and I said I'd arrange it. Then I  told the people at the neighbourhood  house that we were willing to take•  over the ethnic lunch. They said fine.  I signed out the kitchen and made  arrangements for Surjit and Gurmail to  get the shopping money. Surjit and  Gurmail decided on a menu and made a  shopping list. Then we were all ready  until the day of shopping and preparation.  It is still not exactly clear to me  what happened on that fateful day, but  as near as I can piece together it  went something like this. Surjit went  to the neighbourhood house and asked  if it would be open until nine because  they would be late with the groceries.  Surjit speaks very little English or  she could have done the whole thing herself, but as it is the staff didn't  understand what she was saying. They  thought she was looking for.Gurmail who  wasn't there.  Gurmail in the meantime got her cousin  to come with his car and take her shopping. When she arrived at the neighbourhood house with all the food, it was  closed, and nobody was around so she  took all the food to her house. Surjit  went to the neighbourhood house and  couldn't find anybody so she called  Gurmail and Gurmail told her what had  happened. So Surjit went to Gurmail's  house. Gurmail called me but I wasn't  home from work yet.  Meanwhile, I'm standing by the door of  the'Vancouver Little Theatre trying to  think about how the rehearsal went when  the director of the South Vancouver  Neighbourhood House comes around the  corner. It's fate we should meet, she  says. You know the women didn't show  up today to cook for tomorrow. What!  I said. You're kidding. No, she said.  I said, I'll go home and call Gurmail  and find out what happened.  So I went home and called Gurmail and  she told me that she and Surjit and the  food were all at her house - I borrowed  a car and then I called the director  back and talked her into driving over  and opening the neighbourhood house.  Then I drove over to Gurmail's and picked  up Gurmail and Surjit and the groceries  and Gurmail's daughter, Baljit, and we  all went to the neighbourhood house and  cooked for three hours. Gurmail and  Surjit did the cooking and Baljit and I  peeled ginger and potatoes. I figured  out how to make the cuisinart work and  I chopped up onions and chili peppers  and garlic. I had never seen that many  chili peppers before in my life. It was  awesome.  While Gurmail and Surjit chatted away in  Punjabi, Baljit entertained me in English.  We played a game where I picked a colour  and then a number and Baljit told me my  fortune. She said I would become rich.  Ha! She also told me about her baseball  team. I was green with envy. She plays  on a team that has real uniforms. She  plays for Shoppers' Drug Mart and her  brother plays for Army Navy and right  now they're tied for second place, but  Baljit assures me that's only because  they haven't played each other yet.  Baljit says her team always beats her  brother's. Finally, about 11 pm we took  out the garbage and piled in the car  to go home.  Then next day the ethnic lunch came off  like clock work. Kinesis July/August TO   11  LABOUR  The following is an address by Bernadette  Stringer to the Vancouver May Day rally  held May 1st.  Bernadette Stringer did  not speak on behalf of the BC Nurses '  Union (BCNU).  She is the past vice-president of the BCNU and is currently a  steward at Vancouver General Hospital.  The BC Nurses Union held its ' strike vote  in May. Ninety-one percent of the union's  nurses voted to go on strike. As of press  date the union has served strike notice,  and is now in a legal position to strike,  at 48 of the 135 facilities involved in the  dispute.  I am a nurse. I have been for the past  fifteen years. For ten years I have been  active in nurses' unions. When I was  asked to speak I kept thinking: May Day,  Nurses. Nurses, May Day. Do the two  have anything in common? What in heaven's  name am I going to talk about? Then,  slowly, after some tossing and turning  late at night it came to me. I'll talk  about the fact that in the entire history  of May Days throughout this country,  and probably the rest of the world, nurses have not once been asked to lead  the parade.  The point is, when you think of nurses  you don't think of "working class"; when  you think of May Day, you don't think of  a twenty two year old woman taking the  anal temperature of a newborn infant at  four o'clock in the morning. Even here  in this room with all the 'correct politics and lack of sexism not one of you  in a free word association test when  given May Day to respond to would have  nurse. Not even me.  you have to stick together with these  people in fighting for a better  world.  How many nurses in BC would have  working class consciousness defined  in this way? Don't we wisn scientific  socialism could answer seven thousand  three hundred and twelve? The answer,  of course, is not enough; but probably more than you'd think on first  glance.  Nurses share all of the illusions,  all of the mindless television dreams,  all of the brainwashing, that capitalism uses to keep tnis society going.  And then we have some of our own  special little hang-ups. Like professionalism. Liice wanting to marry  doctors and escape this awful world.  Lots of young unmarried nurses are into  the whole Whistler-skiing in the  winter-sailing in the summer-nightclub-Porsche-doctor-scene. But they're  a small minority. Most nurses, like  most women and ninety-eight percent  of us are still women, come from  working class or immigrant backgrounds.  Right now. we're in contract negotiations and the government really thinks  they have us on the run. Their demands  have been almost identical to what they  have offered the Hospital Employees  Union and the' Health Sciences Association.  First they wanted all sorts of concessions, including giving away the first  three days of sick leave, that we start  paying half of our medical and dental  plan even though the employer pays  100 percent now, then we pay them one  dollar per union member to make out our  cheques and lots more.  Working class means male. Working class  means blue collar. Working class means  factories or mines or forests. Working  class means tough and rough and foul  mouthed. Working class means controlling  the means of production. Wording class  can mean women, but women who work for  ' minimum wage. Women who work in huge  offices. Women who do men's jobs. Women  who act like real workers. Women steel-  workers or construction workers or  coal miners. Not nurses.  So what are nurses? Middle class professionals? The pay, the conditions, the  being bossed around all day, tell me that  isn't true. The fact of the matter is,  we get paid less than unionized wood  workers, work as hard or harder than  miners^ have worse shift work than anybody except busdrivers, get shit on all  day by bosses and doctors, do as much  lifting as longshoremen, have a horrible  industrial accident rate, and yet we're  not workers. I say we damn well are'.  I say our bosses can try to fool us by  telling us what wonderful dedicated professionals we all are but we're not  buying it anymore. Well, I'm not. Some  of us aren't. And therein lies one story  to be told here on May Day 1986.  What is the state of working class consciousness among nurses in the province of B.C.? What is working class  consciousness?  For the purpose of this talk I'm  going to say that working class  consciousness is holding the belief  that a large number of your fellow  human beings share something in common with you as a result of what you  and they do for a living. And that  BC nurses  a growing  working class  consciousness  Lots of us are married to bus drivers  and wood workers and other regular  working class people.  Nursing is an occupational goal for  moderately well educated working class  women. Nursing also attracts upwardly  mobile women who historically have  had only one other career choice,  teaching. But this is breaking down  as more choices become available  for women. The fact is, most nurses  have always viewed their jobs as a  means to survive just as most other  workers view their job.  The fact is, nurses in B.C. have  belonged to an association with bargaining rights for as long as most  woodworkers have been unionized:  since just after the Second World  War. An association dominated by head  nurses and administrators for thirty  years but able to bargain with  employers nonetheless. Only for the  past ten years have we had a separate  union and professional association.  And we have never had a major strike  of the entire province to see what  nurses here can accomplish.  Nurses in other provinces, most  notably Alberta, have conducted and  won major strikes which have not only  accomplished major gains in their  contracts but also have made nurses  in those provinces come face to face  with the fact that they are workers.  It's going to happen here too. If not  this contract then the next or the  one after that. Employers will push us  into it. The Socred government will  push us tnto it if they hang around  long enough.  Although they have recently withdrawn  these concession demands they are still  only offering us a zero percent increase for last year, one percent this  year and two percent next year, which  is, of course, effectively a pay cut,  once inflation is taken into account.  We've been negotiating for over a year  and our bargaining committee has finally  responded by calling a strike vote for  May 21. I believe some of the negotiating  committee and staff members from the  BCNU don'-t really think nurses are workers either but the truth of the matter  is that all over the province nurses  are surprising them.  Over one thousand union members out of  15,000 have written letters asking for  a strike vote in response to an ad in  our union paper. The strike vote is  going to take place in three weeks and  I expect there will be a strong yes  vote. Nurses are mad at the cutbacks in  health care because it hits us directly.  We have to do more work at jobs that  were already too hard. We see people dying and we' don't have the time or energy  to look after them as they deserve. We  see what militancy has accomplished in  other provinces and know that we've  fallen, in five years, from best paid  in Canada to sixth best paid amongst  all the provinces. We're not stupid.  We're workers and proud of our skills.  We have a tendency to look up to doctors  and down at other workers in hospitals  but that is changing. The respect most  nurses have for our co-workers in the  Hospital Employees Union and the Health  Sciences Association has increased tremendously. In 1976 during a Hospital  Employees Union strike at Vancouver General, nurses and nursing students did  all the HEU's work, from working in  the laundry to portering patients. Now  we have an official position to maintain  only essential services and not to do  work other than our own if any other  union goes on strike.  The consciousness and conviction that  we are all in this together would not  allow the majority of nurses to be scabs  today. We have some distance to go but  we are clearly recognizing where our  interests lie and I think with time,  experience and a lot more working class  feminist understanding, we'll rise to  the challenge. 12   July/August TO Kinesis  ncest survivors have always been talking.  But it's   probably only been in the last ten  years that anyone has bothered to listen.  Perhaps this is due to the increase in media  attention to incest. Not only has the written  media played its part,but also the visual media ;witness  the sudden increase of films and videos on incest.  by Kim Irving  What is unfortunate is that no feminist  film on incest has ever been produced.  With the exception of a few American videos, few films even come close to addressing feminist analysis or concerns. Most  films take a safe, 'middle'of-the-  >e-  road' approach, afraid to confront the  controversies surrounding incest.  A new film, Breaking Silence,  produced  and directed by Theresa Tollini, must  unfortunately be added to this collection.  This recent purchase of Women in Focus  premiered on June 2 and 3rd in Vancouver.  Even though it's produced by a feminist  and distributed by a feminist centre, the  film remains disappointing because it takes  a middle-of-the-road approach to incest.  Tollini spent the better part of four years  in research and production. During this  time she interviewed several incest survivors and talked with educators and therapists. Her idea to make this film was initiated by a conversation with a woman  police officer who was distraught over the  lack of resources for incest victims. This  is Tollini's first film.  While researching Tollini was able to solicit funds from foundations, corporations  and church groups. Breaking Silence  has  since received a world-wide screening and  picked up four awards, most notably the  Chicago Hugo award for best documentary.  While I question the feminist value in Tollini 's film, I beleive it has important content. For one, the women survivors who tell  their stories in the film are, as in most  incest films, inspiring and validating.  One woman is Nita who, as an incest survivor, is struggling to reclaim lost memories  of sexual abuse by both her father and  brother. Through journal writing and art  Nita found she was always drawing flowers  but couldn't understand why she was compelled to draw them. It wasn't until she  discovered an old photograph of herself and  her mother, taken in her parents' bedroom,  that she recalled the flowered wallpaper on  that bedroom wall. The memories came back.  Explaining her compulsion to draw flowers  Nita explains: "As I was being molested, on  'my parents' bed, I would look at the flowered wallpaper and keep repeating flower,  flower, flower."  Another aspect of the film which I liked was  the series of drawings by sexually abused  children. As the narrator explained, in order  to understand the impact incest has on child  ren we as adults must remember what it was  like to be a child and to be powerless. The  drawings were an effective way of connecting  us, the audience, to those children—to  ourselves.  Tollini's film fails with her decision to  interview rapists and in particular, the  sympathetic view towards these men. It begins with interviewing a male social worker  who discloses being raped as a child, arguing  that more empathy must be given to men raped  as children. He implies that these men, as  adults, may rape eipildre because of their  previous abuse.  Later in the film, an offender interviewed  in shadow admits to raping his daughter. He .  did this, he explains, because he  was raped  as a child. He then congratulated himself for  speaking out because he was therefore "helping his daughter to stop incest when she grew  up."  I asked Tollini why she included these  rapists, .who I found to be victim-blaming  and irresponsible and therefore, I felt,  made the film less credible. She explained:  "I have priorities of what I wanted to  connect with,- where I want to put my energies, on what I want the film to evolve  around. Therefore, in order to understand—  I have to look at both sides."  Tollini continued to say that while interviewing survivors she found most women  wanted to hear from the offenders, wanted  to know why they raped. She!felt that by  including offenders in the film it was  providing an answer.  I'd like to continue with this issue but  other issues need confronting regarding  the screening. I was disturbed that the  panel invited to speak after the film was  represented by professionals: a doctor,  a lawyer and a psychologist. I agree that  these women have done significant work on  incest, but having them as the only "ex—\  perts" alienates the work that has been  done by grassroot organizations and, most  importantly, incest survivors.  I question the appropriateness of allowing men to attend the film's premiere.  Surely, as feminists, we recognize that  men are the primary sexual abusers of  children and many feminists believe that  any man is a potential rapist. Would it  have been too much to ask for a women-only  screening? Having men present when discussing issues that largely affect- women  only threatens our safety. Although there  were only a handful of men at the screen- -  ing, and there were some women who spoke,  I can't help wondering how many women  didn't  speak because of the men's presence.  The general empathy towards men was present in the first question asked after the  film. "Why are men excluded from the film  production and from the panel?"  I was confused by the question, because I .  didn't understand how men were excluded  and also I was angered by the panel's mistake of not responding to the question.  Instead, the women on the panel looked at  ■rfeea.dftilaHm&ker, who choked out some answer  about women as filmmakers and having the  right to women-only production crews. Once  again, this was an instance of how the controversial issues are evaded in order to  stay middle-of-the-road.  And as if this woman's question was a cue,  a man stood up and talked about his sexual  abuse, his story, and how good it felt to  finally talk about it. Thank you, he said,  for listening. As if this wasn't enough,  another man stood up and thanked his brother for speaking out.  I do strongly believe that men need to  start addressing their own physical and  sexual abuse towards each other but this  obviously wasn't the intention of either the  rapists in the film or the men speaking af-  .terwards. Instead, as women, as survivors,  we are once again asked to provide the emotional support to these men—a role women  are always expected to fill.  After the screening, when most of the audience went out to the lobby to mingle with  the panel, a group of women, all of us  survivors, remained in our seats.  We talked about the divisions between survivors  and professionals.  About our anger  at rapists being presented in the film—  that once again they've invaded our space.  One woman commented that as soon as the  first rapist spoke, she "shut-down" and  couldn't respond to anything else in the  film.  We talked about our lack of safety—for  any woman at this screening—and thei.fact  that incest is rarely acknowledged within  the women's community.  Through this discussion, we were able to  comfort ourselves—that we are okay, that  we are surviving. And we talked about how  to continue surviving and to fight back.  We talked and comforted each other, just as  incest survivors have always been doing.  ~H Kinesis July/August TO   13  INTERNATIONAL  Military zapping Greenham women?  by Eunice Brooks  A group of English women have  visited their doctors within  the last 18 months with symptoms that included: nose  bleeds, pain in head and ears,  chest pains, palpations, swelling of the tongue, dizziness,  sunburn in winter, sunburn  at night, menstrual disturbances, loss of hair, impaired  co-ordination, impaired short  term memory, disorientation,  deep depression, and unreasonable panic.  .Some 50 of these women have  made written statements of  symptoms from the list. What  makes these women special is  they live around the perimeter  of an American Military Base—  containing cruise missiles—  called Greenham Common.  Nowadays the press is turning  a blind eye to the women's  peace camp, but it's time for  another look. Something is  happening there that is more  like a plot from Star Trek  than most of us can imagine.  A group of doctors and  scientists tested food and  water in the peace camps.  Measurements of low-level  radiation were also taken.  It was found that an increase  in radiation could be provoked,  simply by starting a demonstration in any place around  the base. It remains to be  proved that a weapon is  being used on the women.  Greenham is 9 miles around  the perimieter. Barbed wire  and razor wire fencing protect it. For months after the  arrival of the missiles hordes  Information for international  stories from: Spare Rib,   Off 0ur\  Backs,   Outwrite,  Globe and Mail  of military personnel inside  and police outside guarded  the place. Now there are none.  Over the past 18 months laws  have been passed in secret  to erode the women's right  to protest. Trespass has  never been a criminal offense  before, but it is now. Police  put out the campfires every  hour in winter. Police do skin  searches on women. Attacks on  the women have come from men  recognized as- American personnel. Now the Yanks may be  trying out a new weapon on  the women.  Low-level microwave radiation  has been used as a weapon for  the past 33 years. It was  used against the American  Embassy in Moscow at one-time.  Back in 1930 the US Navy discovered that persons standing in front of aerials got  weak and drowsy. More testing  was done using 10 marines  and the extra-low frequency  at Clam Lake, Wisconsin. All  but one showed'a rapid buildup of serum triglycerides.  In 1955 the USAF found that  anyone in the way of radar'  beams felt ringing in the  ears, buzzing, vibrations and  pulsations. In I960 work at  Cornell University proved that  people could tell when they  were hit be microwave emissions. Even deaf people could  hear them. In 1972, a US  Department of Defence document said that the army had  tested a microwave weapon.  There have been undocumented '  reports that armies could use  low-level microwave beams as  Thompson/Kowalski case stalled  -On March 21, the United States  Supreme Court refused to hear  an appeal filed by the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union (MCLU)  No comment or explanation was  given for the refusal.  This appeal is only one of the  many legal efforts to contest  guardianship awarded to the  father of severely disabled lesbian Sharon Kowalski.  Kowalski's father has prohibited visitation of his quadriplegic daughter by her lover of  four years, Karen Thompson, as  well as any of her friends, or  MCLU attorneys. In addition,  he has failed to provide Sharon  Kowalski with adequate rehabilitation therapy. (She was the  victim of a drunk-driver caused  car accident in 1984-).  The appeal filed by MCLU contended that Sharon Kowalski's  constitutional right to an  attorney of her choice had been  violated by Minnesota courts,  which rejected her efforts to  retain MCLU attorneys as her  counsel.  Both Sharon Kowalski and her  court-appointed lawyer, Thomas  Hayes, had requested the MCLU  to join the case. Hayes said he  had neither the experience nor  the resources to represent adequately Kowalski's interest in  the suit against her father.  The Minnesota Supreme Court  denied an earlier appeal from  Hayes, upholding a lower court's  ruling that Kowalski "appears"  to be incapable of "independently retaining counsel."  A suit, filed by Kowalski's  lover, Karen Thompson, is pending.  Off Our Backs  a battlefield weapon to immobilise and disorientate opposition.  Is this, happening now at  Greenham?  Studies in the US showed that  irradiated mice had litters  that were mutants. Recent  data from Sweden shows that the  normal balance between cell  types in the central nervous  system has been partially destroyed by exposure to microwaves. Brain tissue changes  alter the exposed person's  ability to concentrate and  cause short term memory loss.  It has been estimated that the  CIA spent millions of dollars  in the sixties on experiments  with mind-altering drugs.  Electro-magnetic weapons are  a new concept. What the  women at Greenham need to know  is: "How can this happen to  us in our own country?" It is  possible, that in England  today, the penalty for opposing the government by peaceful protest, is a restructuring of one's brain cells plus  the loss of any chance to give  birth to normal .children in  the future.  Australian  women's army  A group of women known as  "The Sisters" are training  women to defend themselves  against men on a farm outside  Sydney, Australia, according  to local police. In a sensationalist report in the Australian Sun Herald,  the police  say they photographed the  women dressed in army clothes,  carrying out exercises and  that the women have formed a  special unit to take back  their children from men, by  force.  The police say there is nothing they can do officially as  the women are training on private property. However, they  have been using helicopters  to photograph the land, and  one was quoted as saying,  "there has been a huge upsurge  in the purposefulness of radical female groups, and it is  difficult to keep track of.  them..."  Nigerian women seeking donations  by Eunice Brooks  Money is needed in several  countries in Africa, to educate people about the harm  being done to females by the  religious rite of circumcision.  It involves a partial, and  in some places total clitori-  dectomy.  In Nigeria a feminist Christian  group strongly condemns the  act. Genital mutilations are  performed on females including:  babies, little girls, and women,,  depending on the custom of the  region. Persons who do the mutilation range from an old woman  of the village, to barbers, to  blacksmiths, to modern doctors  in modern hospitals.   In Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Nigeria, and Mali women who have  not had the operation are  called unclean. It is believed  that the clitoridectomy will  diminish a woman's desire for  sex. The reasons given for it  include hygiene. Yet, the  ■ health risks from an operation  done outside of hospital are  great. The exact numbers of  women who have already been  mutilated are unknown, but it  involves tens of millions.

US abortion  victory  American women won a major  victory in June when the United  States Supreme Court upheld  its 1973 decision, which  established women's constitutional right to abortion.  The court's decision is seen as  a major setback to the Reagan  administration which, along  with anti-abortion groups,  urged the Court to overturn  the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade  ruling.  Abortion came before the court  again because of a move by  Pennsylvania to limit state  financial support to women  seeking abortions. The Pennsylvania law also required that  women doctors obtain the "informed consent" of women seeking abortions after telling  them about the "detrimental  physical and psychological  effects," that doctors file  various reports for the public  record about each abortion  performed; that doctors performing third trimester abortions use procedures less  risky to a fetus capable of  surviving outside the womb;  and that two doctors be present at third trimester abortions. The law also required  parental or judicial approval  for minors seeking abortions.  In a five to four decision  the court struck down the  Pennsylvania law saying "The  states are not free, under  the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life,  to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies."  "A Woman's right to make that  choice freely is fundamental.  Any other result, in our view,  would protect inadequately a  central part of the sphere of  liberty that our law guarantees, equality to all."  Charles Fried, the Reagan administration's top courtroom  lawyer repeated the government' sj  opposition to the ruling but  admitted it would be "slightly  futile" to make the same arguments against abortion next  year.  The Court's conservative bloc,  led by Chief Justice Warren  Burger, dissented on the ruling. Burger said he rejected  the idea of abortion on demand and that the 1973 decisioi  must be re-examined.  While American feminists can  be pleased with the Court's rul-|  ing, the future of abortion  rights in the United States is  in no way secure. Reagan is intent on re-moulding the Supreme  Court to his conservative  philosophy. He has sufficient  time remaining in his term to  appoint justices who support  , his social agenda. The anti-  abortionists' strategy, to over  turn Roe v. Wade, may yet prove  successful. 14   July/August TO 1  International Lesbian Conference  Critical access issues avoided, ignored  by Jeny Evans  Throughout this article woman is spelled  womyn—the plural of womyn is wimmin.  At the end of March Louise Proux, from  Vancouver's Dykes for Dykedom, and I  attended the 8th International Lesbian  Information Services Conference (ILIS)  in Geneva, Switzerland.  In Geneva, for those of us who listened,  the conference became a very necessary four  day workshop on exposing the limitations  of a predominently white middle class  movement.  LLIS was formed out of a split at the  International Gay Association Conference  in 1979, from a real necessity to set up  a lesbian only organization to deal with  our oppression as wimmin. Each year, since  1979, lesbians and lesbian groups in var-  600 wimmin, most of whom were white, middle  class and able-bodied. For the first time  efforts were made to organize a truly international conference.  Organizing a conference of this magnitude  is no easy task particularly when the  collective—only eight womyn—are not part  of a large challenging community and when  300 more lesbians than anticipated attend.  However, even given the organizing efforts  of these wimmin, there were serious problems  at the conference that need to be addressed  if our movement is to grow.  The attempts to make the conference an international one, for instance, largely  failed. The one token workshop on racism  was scheduled at the same time as other workshops. There were no workshops for black  wimmin and, in plenary sessions, they had to  *F ^ -CO"  .X?

This includes  organizing the annual conference and working to maintain a growing network of lesbian organizations.  At this year's conference the theme was to  consolidate that which unites us—resistance to patriarchy, and that which divides  us—racism, classism, ageism, ablebodyism  and others. Louise interviewed an organizer  before the conference and asked what ILLS's  expectations were. Four goals were clear:  to reinforce an international lesbian network, to find ways we can work together and  support one another, to find out what, conditions other lesbians live under in different countries, to find out what other lesbians are doing to fight their oppression  and build solidarity.  The conference was organized by members  of a Swiss lesbian collective,; Vanilla  Fraise, who also produce the ILIS newspaper: Clit 007. It was attended by over  >~^ car ^r .#  SLJZjyjF  so  £\sfr  defend their right to meet autonomously.  Although money was used to fly lesbians to  the conference only one womyn from Africa  was funded. When she arrived, from Kenya,  she was housed with a heterosexual woman  who was racist.  sible and that no signers were available.  During the opening plenary, one blind  womyn from Gemma spoke. Gemma is a London based organization for lesbians with :  or without disabilities which was formed .  to bring isolated lesbians together and  enable them to join the lesbian movement.  She warned, "I shall not be remaining  silent on the issues of how lesbians who  are symmetrical and able-bodied shit on  lesbians with disabilities." She asked for  wimmin to do two hour shifts with her  throughout the conference to make sure she  could get around. Only two wimmin responded.  At the end of the conference, she had to  " conclude, "We did not come here solely  to talk about access. The real Issues facing all people with disabilities, lesbians  included, are the ways we are feared and  taunted. I have talked about physical  image. I have talked about the ways in  which we have been excluded. I've talked  about the dependency we have experienced.  I want you to hear one thing: we are  proud to be disabled, that we enjoy our ■  lives. That you and your ideologies about  us being lesser are lies, are hatred, are  fascistic. We will not accept such fascism.  We will demand to be heard. We will demand  to be allowed to live and enjoy ourselves  with our lesbian sisters. You have to move  over and listen."  There was no childcare. You had to preregister, which denied mothers the right  to spontaneity. A few did pre-register,  but it was felt that the numbers didn't  warrant structured childcare.  Her reflections on the conference: "I came  here to fight racism and I can not do that  when it's practised where I- am staying. So  I would like it if ILIS, the honourable ILIS,  could get me home as soon as possible. I am  fed up with being ignored and I'm fed up with  people practising racism on me. I didn't come  here to be an object. I didn't come from  the zoo. I don't see why they invited  "WW  While there were many controversial  issues around accessibility, racism  was the conference's central problem. I'll  give an illustration.

The frustration lesbians feel organizing  in the feminist movement were also"revealed. With thirty minutes left in the  plenary, a white womyn stood to speak for  South Africa. The room exploded. Black  wimmin called, "Where are our black sisters from South Africa?" The womyn was  asked to sit down. She refused. Other  white wimmin defended the womyn's right  to speak and said that the black wimmin's  anger was inappropriate.  A representative form the US National  Lesbian Mothers Defense Fund, whose organization has fought custody battles  in support of over 600 lesbian mothers,  had to miss events to make sure her  daughter was cared for. At the final  plenary she had to point out that  childcare is absolutely necessary if lesbian functions are to be accessible.  Wimmin said things like, "Let's try to  show each other some love rather than  hate." A conference organizer stepped in and told the black wimmin they'd better  behave and speak into the microphone  when it was their turn to speak.  Finally, a womyn from Fiji spoke, "We're  talking about racism here and for many  of us it is an important issue. Wimmin  keep saying "Well, we're wimmin here  together". I realize that Margaret  Thatcher, presumably, is a womyn but I  don't feel any sort of solidarity with  . with Margaret Thatcher. So stop all this  "We are wimmin here together" stuff.  While the debate went on indivdual white  wimmin tried to divert the plenary's  focus on the issue. Precious time was  wasted with responses from white wimmin  like: "I'm oppressed too, because I'm  six feet tall" or "I too am discriminated  against because I'm an older womyn." Some  white wimmin dismissed black wimmin's  critisism by saying, "It's very important  that we do not waste time in disagreements  and arguments on racism and other things  like that."  Direction returned when an Asian-American  grassroots activist from New York said:  "As I look down at this panel, as I look  around this room, what else did you expect  black wimmin to do (but react against  racism at the conference)? We lesbians must  change our perspective. You must look.at  port for black wimmin at the conference's  opening plenary. This meeting, attended by  30 wimmin and called to challenge white  wimmin's racism, became another forum to  criticize black wimmin. In frustration a  group of anarchists decided to meet separately to prepare a statement for the closing plenary which would expose the conference's racism. Exhaustion and lack of time,  however, meant the group could not develop  a statement that was satisfactory. Throughout the entire "conference only one white  womyn publicly confronted the conference's  It was frustrating, amidst these barriers  and defensiveness, to get down to doing  international lesbian solidarity work.  Some networking was accomplished at the  conference. Black, Asian and Latin American lesbians were able to meet each other  for the first time .and do serious work in  organizing around international lesbian  struggles. Wimmin with a committment to  struggle came with a focus to gather, interview and record information to bring  back to our own communities.

Such defensiveness is a repeatred tactic  the poor, you must look at the working  wimmin, you must look at my sister (from  the South Pacific) who has been silenced  for so long. I hope at next years conference I can look down at that panel and see  black wimmin, poor wimmin and disabled  wimmin."  Once again a black womyn offered some direction when she said, "Who was the first  person to get the vote in America? It was  a white man. Who was the second person?  A white womyn. Who was the third person?  A black man, and who was the last person?  A black womyn. You say "don't separate being on lesbians in physiciatric institutions,  black from being a lesbian'.' Look at us today, on pornography or prostitution. No work-  Many wimmin came, however, with little  interest in active participation in participation in political issues. Their focus  at Geneva was one of personal pleasure.  I went to Geneva with many illusions about  an international lesbian conference. Lesbians at the conference should have left  much more politicized on issues of race  and class. Excluding these concerns make  sexuality a privileged focus.  There are horrific oppressions we have  chosen to ignore. There was no workshop  I'm black, you're white. If I'm in a crowd  I am a black womyn.. I will be picked out."  As white people our skin is our passport,  making it easier for us to travel internationally. Black wimmin consistently found  they had to pay three times the taxi fare  to go the same distances as white womyn.  Hotels charged much higher room rates to  deter black wimmin from registering. Service in restaurants amounted to sitting  and waiting and waiting and waiting while .  all around whites were served. Intimidation  and harassment of this nature is entirely  racist and more importantly, can lead to  serious consequences. Wimmin could face  prison, upon their return home, if it  was found out that they were travelling  abroad for an international lesbian conference .  At the conference Itself there were many  instances of how white wimmins assumptions  prevented womyn of colour from full participation. For example, the organizers planned  a demonstration focussing on the right to  political asylum for all lesbians, which  didn't take into account wimmin of colour's  reality. They took for granted the freedom  that while wimmin have to demonstrate and  didn't research or prepare for any legal  problems if there were any arrests that  could have resulted in deportations. So  black wimmin didn't participate and the  demonstration was exclusively white.  Some white wimmin were  outraged at the conference 's racism and a white wimmin's meeting was called to deal with the lack of sup-  shop dealing with the realities facing  isolated and poor wimmin, or on the  affect relocation has on the aboriginal  peoples of the world. No workshop on the  survival issues facing Central America  or black wimmin's resistance to apartheid  in South Africa.  We have to seriously make the links to  see the racism inherent in using our  privilege, our money, time, access to  print and mobility, only to better or  maintain our own status.  White lesbians can no longer declare that  it is our movement. Our defensive responses to issues of facism, classism and able-  bodyism were an outrage. Such defensiveness  is a repeated tactic used by middle class.  It's intent is to silence and block rage.  Kinesis July/August TO   15  Netherlands!

ILIS has designated  the first week in October as a time for  action on international lesbian issues.  This week gives us an opportunity to  work within our communities to expand  our political focus. For lesbians, this  work is vital to a strong and responsible  movement.  The 9th ILIS conference is tentatively  scheduled for Mexico during the summer  of 1987. The Basque country, in the north  of Spain, was also being considered. A  Black womyn from London.proposed that  next years' conference be five days: the  first three days for First Nation wimmin  and the last two days to include white  wimmin on First Nation's wimmin's terms.

Lillian Allen considers  community, culture and criticism  by Kandace Kerr  Lillian Allen is a Toronto-based dub  poet.  Her work is rooted in community  organizing and action,  an outgrowth of  her political and social involvement  with black communities in New York and  later,  Toronto.  She was interviewed for  Kinesis by Kandace Kerr.  Dub poetry developed out of reggae music.  Traditional dub poetry relies heavily  on mainstream reggae rythms and, until  quite recently, was almost exclusively  male. Allen's work is very different:  her poetry reaches across a wide spectrum of experience, speaking the pain  of incest and teenage pregnancy, the  angst of no money and no future, the  anger-of a community at the murderous  actions of police, of racism and greed.  Community has always been important to  Lillian Allen, from her childhood in  Jamaica to her current work encouraging  young dub poets in the Toronto area.  Born in Spanishtown, Jamaica the fifth  of ten children, Lillian grew up in a  tightly knit family. Her grandmother  was a haggler, a market-seller: Lillian  remembers her mother as "always working".  As she pursued her high school studies,  much to the dismay of her wealthier  schoolmates, Lillian discovered the  escapism of literature.  "I remember really grooving on literature...I'm the kid, you'd come over on  a Friday night and see me reading stuff  I'd have to read, and I remember people  laughing at me, right, I found it interesting, man. The thing transported me  and gave me an option...it gave me a  place where I could be...and nobody  else was there, and I could do anything  I wanted, right...  "I remember distinclty figuring how  groovy that was, and that in fact instead  of somebody else taking me on their  journey or taking me where they wanted  to be, right, I could create my own  world.  I didn't have to wait for somebody to  create it for me.  I made stories up a lot and wrote it down,  and told stories. I basically used my  writing as a place where I could test  my ideas, where I could work 'things out,  it was a real special place, you know, it  was a place where...1 figured things  out, I consolidated things, and I just  go, you know...a real freedom trip.  But I didn't think of writing as social,  it was more of a personal kind of  thing...social, I mean, is making the  connection to other people and to what's  going on in a conscious way.  I remember when I came back to Toronto  in '74 (from the States). I again sought  out community...started to volunteer,  joined organizations and so on, and I  was writing- still and I would begin to  use my work there as part of that process of community organizing. When  there was event, you know, stuff around  police brutality, there was a lot of  stuff happening in and around the black  community, I would always offer up a  poem or offer to write something about  it, mainly because I figured that  I could capture in a piece of work, in  3 minutes, what 3 speeches were trying  to do...make an impact, right, and that's  what I did.  At first it was a struggle, it was like  they want you on during the break, or  when everybody's getting up, right, 'or  after 5 speeches, you know—"And good  night everybody we'll take some money  up now and now Lillian will•••" (laughs)  we sort of had to struggle to let them  know it needs to be there, it needs to  give people life, and then they started  seeing it, you know, it started to happen, and people started looking for it,  so people started asking for it. That's  sort of how I got in.  Kandace: I'll be honest.   When Lillian  Allen 's name appeared as one of the  feature performers at Folklife,  part of  expo, my gut reaction was profound disappointment—a reaction shared by many  others.  To some,  it was a sell out;  for others,   it was not quite that  drastic,  but mildly disturbing,  nonetheless.  Kandace:  The criticism has been expressed  that if performers like yourself,  political artists,  were really political,   they  wouldn't have even considered playing  expo in the first place.  Lillian:   ...I don't know why people are  surprised...this is what I can't figure  out... it's like the domed stadium, and  I can't figure out why people are targeting those things... it's an outgrowth  of the capitalist system and in fact if  you poll working class people they'll go  with;it because of the way they have  been brutalized...made hungry and then  given limited options, right, the actual  work we have to do is with those people,  we have to get into the community and  get to the root of the matter and start  tearing away at the sheen that's been  placed over people. ..  I have ten. years of politics in an ongoing way...playing at expo didn't seem  any different than getting Canada Council  or playing in a bar or something. A lot •  of people use those words because they're  not engaged, they have to be out there,  working in the community, you know, and  they can stand around and be purists,  right, because they don't have to be  there making decisions on a day to day.  basis...so...what does it mean when people  say you're not political?  .All my life there have been people who've  been telling me what to do, and I've  done what I wanted to do, because if it's  my mistake I have to be self-critie'al^^*.  it's my ass, right? When I was doing  this album (Revolutionary Tea Party) with  the Parachute Club (producer/musicians)  people were saying: "flan, that's roots  stuff, you can't let those guys do it...  man, you need some distance..." everybody has something to say but ain't  nobody comin' out, I mean I've been  doing this stuff for a decade and I need  to do an album, but there's nobody  saying Lillian, you need to do an album, let's hep you do it...but the minute I'm getting it together everybody's  gonna tell me how to do it...  Kandace:  What kind of response are you  getting from expo audiences'?  Lillian:  The piece that's getting the  best response, that people have sat  down quietly through, that people have  applauded the introduction and applauded sustainedly afterwards, is- Nellie  Bellie Swellie, the piece about incest,  about violence against young women.  I never thought I wouldn't play expo, what can I say. I mean, who in  their right mind...expois a natural outgrowth of the capitalist system,  it happens every few years... it's their little whooppee.  Lillian: See, I never thought I wouldn't  play expo. I mean, first of all I can't  defend expo, what can.I say? I mean, who  in their right mind...expo is a natural  outgrowth of the capitalist system, it  happens every few years...it's their  you know, their little whoopee right?  I find that, as a black person in this  society, you know, I have less options  than other folks have, than white folks  have. I find I had to fight like hell  for my voice to be heard. And I find  that I emerged not out of any political  process or out of the goodness of anybody's heart, but because I'm so good  and so persistent. You know, I find that  I need to speak. I cannot impose silence  on myself once the door has been opened.  Nobody can tell me what to say...  I mean, there are some women who come  back and sit there, for the whole day,  and there are people who are coming  up, basically saying, you know, that  they want to get us here, they want  to get us there, they're making contact people are saying "this is stuff  I wished I'd known about, I'm longing  to hear such stuff," so it's beginning  to get to some people and the network  is beginning to happen."  Lillian Allen is one of the few women  currently writing and recording dub  poetry. Male dub artists like Linton  Kwesi Johnson and .Jitutabaruka often credit Louise Bennett as one of their main  influences but,  by and large,  dub is a  male preserve.   Lillian Allen continued next page Kinesis July/August TO   17  Kandace: How did  Curfew in BC/The Five  come about?  Lillian:   "...I wanted to do a piece to  sort of pull together some of their  (the "five's") ideas, you know, and in  fact a lot of their ideas are in common  with the ideas of progressive people all  over the world. And I also keep hearing  about, .how people in BC are feeling really  down, really discouraged and I thought  I wanted to do a piece to do what political art should do, revive people and  get people up and around and, you know,  funk down on the system so I did  Curfew which outlines the conditions in  BC for the BC people and the actions of  the Socred government....  When I was out here for the Folk Festival,  or maybe some other time, I jammed with  Rachel (Melas) and Roscoe (Hales, both  of the Animal Slaves), two musicians I  respect very much, and talked about my  ideas and recording some music and  basically getting it out. So when they  came to Toronto last summer we sort of  got it together, myself, Marian Lydbrooke,  Elaine Stef (both members, with Rachel,  of the Moral Lepers), Roscoe, Rachel..."  (available on cassete).  Her new album, Revolutionary Tea Party,  entailed a different approach to the  melding of poetry and music.  Lillian:  We met for a long time beforehand before we actually got into the  studio, and during that time we j  meeting, we were talking a lot about my  work and the approach developed, a philosophical approach to the work, which  basically said that the poetry existed  for itself and existed to breathe life  into the instruments, right. As opposed  to the other way I've worked with  musicians before, where they've either  played what they wanted to play, or  played some music that the poetry had  to fit into, right?  For me, it is a consolidation of the  work that I've done over the past ten  years and a lot of ideas that I've had.  So it's like a writer with a book, now  I have a chance to move on..."  De Dub Poets with Clifton Joseph and  Devon Houghton,  Curfew in BC/The Five  (cassette), Revolutionary Tea Party  Lillian:   "Reggae music (laughs) and dub  poetry has been influenced by reggae  stylistically (and) the reggae tradition  is a patriarchal domain, it's a bullpen.  So there's Breeze in Jamaica, and there's  a number of other women. There's a compilation album out, Womantalk  (on the  Heartbeat label) with a number of women  on it (who) haven't quite come into  their voices yet, as far as I read the  Jamaican scene. But I think my album will  do a lot for those women.  In Toronto there are a couple, there's  one person who is particularly good and  is doing quite well, Audrey Zini Mandela.  There also are lots and lots of other  people who are doing one or two pieces,  but there's a couple who are working at  it consistently.  One of the things I've done in Toronto  is to take the time to do the kind of  nurturing, the kind of building that  has created a movement of dub poets so  that Toronto probably has more dub poets  than any place else, and that's exciting...the biggest innovation in dub  poetry is happening right here in Canada.1  Kandace: Do. you see your approach as  breaking that patriarchal shell (of  dub)?  Lillian:  "Oh yeah, especially as I'm one  of the pioneers they call me the godmother of dub (laughs) especially that,  again, a lot of the innovations are coming from here, coming from my spheres  of influence."  Kandace: Such as...?  Lillian:  "Technique, subject matter,  musicality, everything you can think of.  If you notice...a straight kind of delivery. . .based on voice just weaving around,  which I say is based on reggae, the more  classical beat, as opposed to some of  the innovations I've put in, some of the  emotiveness, some of the changes in internal rhythm. 18   July/August TO Kinesis  Women in country music  Babies, Burdens and Broken Hearts  by Noreen Howes  If you can find it in your heart to Just  forgive/ I'll come back and live the way  you've wanted me to live/ All I want is  Just to be your girl/ Please come and get  me, and take me to your world.  I'm a feminist. I'm also a proud lover  of mainstream country music, some of it  featuring lyrics such as these. It isn't  an easy thing to admit, but I've struggled along and with every spurt of development within my feminist consciousness  Tammy, Loretta, Dolly, Patsy and Kitty  are right'there with me. In fact, their  music has helped develop my feminist  consciousness.  My initial attraction to country music  was for their powerful and passionate  voices. I loved the whines, twangs and  teardrops in every syllable. Then I  began concentrating on the messages these  women were singing, and my interest  grew.  Loretta Lynn sings:  The girls in New York city they all  march for women's lib/ and better homes  and gardens show the modern way to live/  and the pill may change the world tomorrow but meanwhile today/ here in'Topeka  the screen door 's-a-bangin',  the coffee's  boilin' over and the wash needs-a-hangin',  one wants a kissin' and one wants a  changin' and one's on the way.  I value women's country music because  it's simple, it's real and I trust it.  As a cultural phenomenon it's the voice  of working class women courageously  applauding their life's work, and so do I.  Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette are archetypal Nashville women. Both travelled the  road to superstardom in the late fifties  and arrived in the sixties. Both sang  about the working class housewife. Although their words reached the same audiences the message each woman presented  was remarkably different. A suggested  clue as to why these differences exist:  Loretta Lynn pens most of her own mater-  'Z&iffi-whereas Tammy Wynette's greatest  hits are written by men.  Tammy Wynette is submissive to her husband. She doesn't hesitate to lay herself  at his feet to be trampled upon. She  appears to enjoy it, believing the ultimate marital crisis to be unspeakable—  D-I-V-O-R-C-E.   So Wynette whines her way  through marriage, a 'good little doormat'.  And if she finally decides to get off  the ground it's only to stand by her man.  "Here's a song I love to sing", she tells  us "i't's about the man that wears my ring/  and even though he's tempted he knows  I'll make sure that he gets everything."  There is one gleam of hope within  Wynette's musical marriage manual but  it doesn't concern her situation as wife-  protagonist, it's her young daughter who ;  criticises traditional marriage. In I Don't  Wanna Play House  the mother weeps as she  WAHNA  plaj House  -EC  Mm  hears her child say to the little  boy next door: I don't wanna  play house,  I know it can't  be fun/ I've watched mommy  and daddy and if that 's  the way it 's done...  TmiS^J*  ^JYaSstT   O*1 ^he theme of marriage  *J\L^^W% Loretta Lynn belts out:  *^aASI   »i wash and iron and  cook and sew and find  time for your naggin'/  :but you seem to forget  big boy, that two mules  pull this wagon." She  accepts traditional marriage roles: the husband brings  home the bacon and the wife  cooks it, but she demands recognition and  appreciation for the  plate before him.  While Wynette lays down  the doormat for the husband to trample on,  Lynn yanks it up from  beneath his fe'et. Although she accepts  certain restrictions  such as women's role  within the home,  she fights for  healthy changes  within the  marriage.  Also unlike  Wynette, Lynn  has self-  respect  which further ignites her fire. Almost  invariably the husband is a drunken  fool whom she must nag, or he is yet'  another one of her growing brood, demanding attention. In "Don't Come Home A-  Drinkin'(With Lovin' On Your Mind)" she  throws him out of her bed. "Well you  thought I'd be waitin' up when you came  home last night/ you'd been out with all  the boys and you ended up half tight/  well liquor and love they just don't  mix leave the bottle or me behind..."  The implication is sexual: she has good  lovin' and he won't get any of it unless  he deserves it.  Sexuality is presented differently H  in Tammy Wynette's songs. She  makes no sexual demand on her hus- fl  band-lover and she therefore re-  I  ceives no pleasure. In fact, the  i  whole sex thing sort of puzzles  Tammy. "I don't know what I do  that's right but it makes him  come home at night" she sings.  While he is perpetually tempted  by honky-tonk women out there,  and like most men in country  music, is led around by his  libido, she remains at home to  be sexually available and satis-  I  fying for him. The doormat now  lies on the bed.  In Your Good Girl's Gonna Go  Bad  she decides to feed his sex-  I  ual appetite with the delicacies  I  he appears to like best. To  resemble the other women (whom  she believes he's attracted to)  she'll paint up, powder up,  dress up fancy and be the  "swingingest swinger" he's ever  had.  According to the wife in this song, appealing to the husband's sexuality regardless  of her own identity and desires is an  ingredient to a successful marriage. The  implication is that she, as a wife, doesn't  deserve  sexual pleasure. She promises to -  "change if it takes that to make you happy/  from now on you're gonna see a different  me." The title alone implies that 'good  girls' don't enjoy sex while 'bad girls'  do. Wynette identifies with the.good  girls, but she'll pretend if it will save  her marriage.  In contrast, a predominant theme in Loretta  Lynn's work is that women should be as  free as men sexually. "As far as the Bible  is concerned" she argues "it's just as bad  for one as for the other". In The Pill she  sings about the sexual freedom which  accompanies freedom from pregnancy.  It's a funny and touching manifesto of a  woman's liberation and her renewed sexual  desire. "This incubator is overused because  you've kept it filled" she sings "but  feeling good comes easy now since I've got  the pill". She continues to say that her  old maternity dresses are going in the  garbage (which suggest the 'bra burning'  of the early days of women's lib) and that  from now on she'11.dress differently—  "mini-skirts and hot pants and a few little '  fancy frills" to please herself, not her  virile husband.  Like Wynette, Loretta Lynn makes a clear  distinction between the sexuality of 'good  girls' and 'bad girls',- but unlike Wynette  she admits having her own desires, and  refuses to surrender them—and her good  loving—to satisfy her husband (who is too  drunk anyway to know the difference).  Another theme running through women's country music is the threat to hearth and home  of the evil "other woman". Few songs present her compassionately.  Wynette depicts her as a well made-up,  fancy-dressed creature who tempts the husband from the wife's loving arms. These  loose women definitely swing, and some even  drink whiskey. But, according to Wynette,  a husband only cheats if he's not getting  what he needs at home. It's therefore  neither the other woman's fault nor the  husband's—it's the wife's alone. And if  he does stray into that illicit bed she  assures him that she'll: "keep waiting  in this lonely room just in ease you  change your mind" and return.  The other woman also plays a significant  role in Loretta Lynn's songs where the  husband walks into the path of temptation, trips, and falls into her experienced arms. But he is not promptly  forgiven. He must prove himself worthy  of his wife before returning home.  Although responsible for his actions,  Lynn suggests that wives must expect  •husbands to 'stray', as though adultery  is an inherent male quality. Their  brains are dimmed by moonshine, she  implies, and at best they're just  irresponsible 'boys'. But it's when  women act just as foolishly, such as  the honky-tonkin' other woman, that  she is least compassionate. "You ain't  woman enough," she challenges her,  "to take my man".  Women as friends or emotional support  are absent in both Wynette's and Lynn-''S  songs. The cast of characters include:  husband, children, husband's drinking  buddies ("old army friends") and the  other woman. This absence of women  friends suggests tremendous energy demanded by the housewife simply in running the house and disciplining children and husband. Not enough time for  friends.  This phenomenon is particularly interesting when one considers well-known  friendships between stars such as Loretta  Lynn and Patsy Cline.  MAN'S HON 10/-  IdNK ArJG6L..  Another explanation for the absence of  women as friends is that the mainstream  country music industry is ruled by men  who consider it easier to present women  as rivals—their sole ambition being  gettin' and keepin' their man—than to  honestly present these women as coffee  drinking allies sharing horror stories  of husbands.  I enjoy country music even though examples of anti-woman propaganda—such as  women as enemies—are often expressed.  As feminists rightly argue, the lyrics  are  sexist. But to dismiss the music  for these reasons would be an unjust  dismissal of the experiences of thousands of women—housewives, trapped in  marriages.  I began this examination of women's  country music with the most sexist  lyrics I could find. I£oweri^]£r unpalatable stuff, not surprisingly coming  from Tammy Wynette. That particular  song Welcome To My World focuses on a  woman's oppression and absolute self-  denial: a song about a living death.  What affect can these words have on  women other than despair? None, I expect,  except for the simple fact that Wynette  is recognizing many women's reality.  The most harmful element in her lyrics  is the inherent hopelessness. She repeatedly counsels women to accept, as  wives, the anguish of marital servitude—as though the ring upon their  fingers becomes a rope around their  necks which they must continue wearing.  Lynn's music seems a response to Wynette,  as if she heard Stand By Your Man  once  too often. (Incidentally, a tradition  in country and western music is  to  respond to another artist's material).  In Loretta Lynn's work she appears to  have moved from despair into positive  action, recognizing that there's a  battle, but that she's armed and angry.  Granted, battlelines are strictly drawn  and adhered to: within the marriage.  Women's country music rarely examines  alternatives to the nuclear family and  (many) accompanying traditional values,•  »b it  but with Lynn the rules- are bent and  women's power realized. She inspires us  with hope both through her honest and  appreciative portrayal of women's work,  and through her show of personal strength  and dignity.  It's important to consider why divorce  is rarely expressed as. a viable alternative to marriage. It suggests that for  the majority of working class women adequate alternatives simply don't exist.  As tough as marriage may be, the divorced woman in country music has it tougher.  "The women all look at you like you're  bad", Lynn sings of the divorced woman,  "And the men all hope you are"—but go  ahead and live your life, she advises  her, and "let 'em talk".  The reality is, it's an incredible financial and emotional struggle for a;woman  with little education and no job skills  to independently support herself and her  children. In many, ways it'.s understandable why women would choose to remain  married, with the devil they know—and  his paycheck, rather than experience the  reality of single motherhood.  I trust and enjoy the music.of Nashville-  women like Tammy Wynette and Loretta  Lynn because in their unpretentious (yes~  and sometimes even corny) way, they sing  about what's happening out there. And  through first recognizing problems and  restrictions we can develop solutions.  Also, by concentrating solely on those  two artists and their different approaches  to similar issues, I'm proving that country music is not monolithic (a common misconception) regarding its' presentation  of women.  So don't be afraid. Tune into a local  country music station and listen for  yourself. One warning though: study has  proven that Vancouver radio stations,  like the music industry itself, doesn't  fully appreciate women's music. Almost  all the voices you'll hear—will be men's. 20   July/August TO Kinesis  VLC Coffeehouse turning a new leaf  If  i ®>'  mmtm&M  by Nadine Davenport  Currently there are four women in the  collective that produces the women's  coffeehouse. With a number of successful nights of entertainment under our  belts we see the coffeehouse as a necessary part of this community. Although  support from the community in recent  weeks has diminished the collective is  turning a new leaf which has lead to  a new format for the summer months.  The coffeehouse doors'will be open for  three days out of each month in the  summer, bringing in entertainment at  each of these dates and charging a little bit more at the door to cover the  cost and support of paying the performers.  You can look forward—to a number of  women musicans and performers including: We Three/Ezzel: July 17th (tentative booking) and six local women  musicians and songwriters share the  stage for a round robin evening with  Maura Volante, Isis, Sylvie Murphy,  Norma, Donna Lee, and Nadine Davenport:  July 25 (tentative booking).  In late August/early September confirmation on an evening with Acting Up  Theatre Group and Aya, a women's a  capella group, are still under way.  .As well as a bill with Raw Sugar, a  one woman show from Seattle and an  evening with our own Marcia Meyer.  Also in the works is a proposed ping  pong tournament for the fall. Any  women interested please get in contact  soon with the collective'. Ping Pong  equipment donations will also be  welcome.  Networking music and culture  by Nadine Davenport  Some of us remember in 1982 an ad hoc  group of women decided to produce a concert with Alix Dobkin, a well-known lesbian singer/songwriter. A workshop followed  the next day. The concert was moving,  the workshop inspiring. I was impressed  with the concert's production team,  although both events did not manage to  break even. The group disbanded.  Many have tried since. Producing themselves  if they're musicians. Working a gig for  free, and barely making enough to pay the  sound woman. The Vancouver Folk Music Fesr-  tival has faithfully filled in the gaps  over the years, bringing in various women's  music artists of our industry. (Although  first hand experience with the festival  leads one to admit, breaking even is a  foreign word in this business).  But is it possible in this  city, in this  women's community, (that is, perhaps too  laid back to keep any kind of music project going and supported for more than .  one year) to turn a new leaf, to strive  for quality in production, communication,  • administration, and a general networking  of women's music and culture in Vancouver  and Canada's west coast? A sort of San  Francisco of Canada, if you will.  Ideas and possibilities for this project  have been brewing for four years. We  have just begun. Women are beginning to  come out of the woodwork and voice interest  in a project such as this.  A project that would be as diverse as  our community. A project that would offer  strength and organization to women's music  and culture in Vancouver.  Women's music has many  representations: a project as  diverse as our community.  The goals are these: to build a network  of women musicians/artists/technicians/  administrators/producers that would pioneer a women's music and culture founda  tion in Vancouver and Canada's west coast.!  It's happening everywhere else, why not  in Vancouver?  Long range goals include a network j  membership which would support a number  of smaller projects. A newsletter with  events local and national. A women's  production company, producing concerts,  workshops and festivals. A women's  music studio, and a basic skill-sharing  network between, individual specialized  groups. This would be housed in a 3  storey building in the Chinatown/Gas-  town area.  The possibilities are endless. I think  it could happen, and many other women  are beginning to think so too.  To make this project work we need to be  strong. To say to our sisters whose  struggle it was before, the time has  come. Lend a hand to the women who will  make this project happen today.  Women's music has many representations.  Let's all see if we can share and  live under one roof and be a city that's  not only know for "where Ferron is  from" but to stand for much more.  There is going to be a co-ordinators  meeting on July 15 at 7:30 pm. You can  call Nadine Davenport 254-7475 for  location. Those women interested please  phone for more information on the location.  There will also be a city-wide "project connection" meeting of all interested women who feel this project would  benefit them.  This will take place at the Lesbian  Centre, 876 Commercial Drive at  7:30 pm on July 22nd/86. All .women  welcome.  The Vancouver Women's Music Network  project will only be possible with  your support. Face the music'. The time  has come I  Any women interested in this project  phone Nadine Davenport 254-7479 or  VLC 254-8458.  In fact, the coffeehouse collectiv  always looking for new members to join  our collective. New ideas and new energy  will be most welcome to begin fall scheduling of events and music.  Being a member of the collective is easy.  The coffeehouse evening workshifts are  set up in pairs (perhaps three women are  needed"on busy entertainment nights) setting up tables, the coffee bar, and a sound  system for the performers are the duties  of each coffeehouse collective member. We  run a rotating schedule and welcome women  who are interested.  Any women experienced in MCing are also  needed, as well as women with strategies  on fundraising and publicity.  The bottom line is the women's coffeehouse  needs to be supported by the community. '  The money made by the coffeehouse goes to  the Lesbian Connection, which pays for  rent and- supplies.  Many of us remember six or seven years  ago there was a coffeehouse. There hasn't  been one for years and we all need to  support and learn the skills again to  share our women's music and culture with  every woman in our community. We all, in  .turn, should support the women who make  the music.  Any woman interested in joining the women's  coffeehouse collective please call VLC  254-854-8 or Nadine 254-7479 or drop by on  a Friday night from 7:30 pm.  Look for advertisements on the confirmations on our summer concert line-up and  tell your friends.  Let's all keep women's music and culture  alive and well and.living in Vancouver.  "/ just love women who keep up with  women's music and culture."  by Connie Smith  This will be my last Rubymusic column for  a while. But before I go, I want to tell  you how this column came about.  The column was inspired by my radio program, Rubymusic,  which went on the air  May 16, 1981 on CFRO. At Cy-Thea Sand's  suggestion, the first Rubymusic column  appeared in 1982 in Issue Seven/Eight of  The Radical Reviewer,  a literary journal  which Cy-Thea edited. Issue Nine, published  in 1983, carried the first of my articles  on "girl group" music.  When The Radical Reviewer  ceased publishing  in 1983, Cole Dudley invited Cy-Thea and  myself to -bring our columns to Kinesis.  We did, and Rubymusic has appeared monthly  since December '83. (With special issues  included, this comes to a grand total of  35+ stories on women musicians and singers)  It's been an incredible experience having  the opportunity to write history, and in  some cases, to rewrite it. There have  been many exciting moments, and I assume  there will be more when I return. **<***<?re*recicc**<***»re»racre<^  Yomedeclaro  campanera  con mi voz  Kinesis July/August TO   21  sometimes can be a lot more effective than  a political speech. I've already been  touched by the repression. I know that they  could grab me again. I'm aware of that.  • you touched by the repression?  CHISTINA GONZALEZ  by Kim Irving and Helen Dixon  Chilean singer Cristina Gonzalez recently  performed in Vancouver at a Pena-concert  organized by the Committee for the defense  of Human Rights in Chile. For the first  time,  Cristina is touring Canada (she'll  visit Calgary, Montreal and Kitchener) and  she hopes to return for Winnipeg's Women 's  Music festival in September.  Her music is a mixture of soft ballads  and semi-pop.  She sings about peace,  women's liberation and the continuous  struggles faced by the people of Chile.  Cristina reverse 's the  "r" in her name to  indicate resistance,  a subtle bit of  activism that 's necessary in a country  that represses any political action.  Cristina has a year and a half old daughter named Victoria Luna,  who lives with  her father in Santiago.  This interview was  originally done in Spanish.  Copies of  Cristina's tape  "Mensaero del amor" are  available at the Women 's Bookstore.  What is the situation for women in Chile  now?  The participation of women in Chile right  now is very important. That doesn't mean  to say it's just right now that they are  involved. Women have always been there,  in all Latin America struggles. They are a  very important element. Women in Chile are  now much more organized. There Is an understanding that the liberation of women will  only come through the liberation of all the  people. A lot of issues are coming up in  every class, in every social layer. One  thing that has to be really understood is  everybody, men and women, have their  sibilities within the home.-  El Comienzo de la Vida  "...

What that means is they are  not only unifying but they are much more  confrontational. They're much more outspoken, more militant.  How did you get started in music?  How i  In 1983, we were involved in one of the  days that was called for the national  protest in Chile. We went to a really militant sector of the city of Santiago, a  shantytown called Pudahuel. What we were  doing was music in the form of popular  education. That's one of the things we  use our music for. So, a group of us  were there and it was raided. Three members of our group were taken by the  CNI (Chilean secret police) and they were  sent to internal exiles or regulated  to very isolated areas of the country  where they have to sign in with the local  police everyday, sometimes several times  a day. And there are other types of  indirect repressions. For example, the  lack of work and the fact that I can't  icate over the mass media.  There 's no radio station that '11 play  your music?  There are two radio stations that do play  our music, but it's only for an hour,  . much like Co-op radio in Vancouver. One  of our stations is called Co-op radio, and  the other is called Chilean Radio.  Are they alternative stations?  No, not exactly alternative in the way  Co-op Radio is in Vancouver. A lot of  their programming is organized by the  Church. They tend to be more democratic,  have more space for national music, rather  than the larger commercial stations.  The way we function is through other alternative channels. Like people record their  cassettes, they don't wait for some big-  shot to do it for them. A poet doesn't  wait to get his or her book published, they  go to political and cultural events and  read. That's how we get our message across.  Here in Canada women can organize separate]  for instance there is "women's music". How  does it differ in Chile?  Women in Chile are not really organized  within a feminist movement. As I said, they  are organized in a struggle which the whole  population is involved in. We still see  the issues of women in a similar way, like  My family has always been connected to music  (Cristina's mother Myriam  is a popular sing-  spon- er in Spain). Because of that, I never wanted  to get involved in music. I was around it all  the time when I was living in Spain and getting involved in other kinds of work. I felt  at one point that I really wanted to return  to Chile, to get a sense of my country,  where I was from...  So when I returned, I linked up with people  involved in music and cultural work. I began to write songs, without being asked to.  in Canada. We don't deny the struggles women I realized I had to take it up in 1  much  more' professional and responsible way. Dedicate myself to it.  Can you tell us a bit about the history of  women's music in Chile?  A very important woman is Violetta Parra.  We still haven't been able to discover the  context of her work, who she was...Violetta  was involved in all forms of art, not just  music. She was involved in making paintings,  arpilleras  (tapestries), ceramics, poetry,  and music. She spoke and built a whole new  language. She revolutionalized the sense  . of what could be done with art. We still  years of dictatorship, the people have grown, don't know the full extent of all the work  we have understood the necessity of organiz- she did. I don't know if a new Violetta Parra  ing ourselves at a much higher level.  must fight. But the struggles we have as  women are going on in a different context.  We are living in a situation that is so  intense, so critical. So this means a spe- ,•  cific movment just around women's issues  hasn't developed. This doesn't mean to say  that it'll never happen. It'll happen and  probably it'll happen quite soon. But it's  still missing a certain context.  How is the political atmosphere in Chile  now?  The dictatorship is in a very critical  period. It is in crisis. After thirteen  All sectors of society are organizing: the  women, the students, the shantytown dwellers, the workers...everybody in every  sector.  The most predominant are the shantytown  dwellers and the students.  What women have brought to this is very  important. Women have been able to organ-  has been born yet. At the same time there  are women in Chile involved in music and  art, some of them very good.  Isn't it dangerous for you to be touring  and singing such political songs?  There is no alternative for me, it's my  principles! Being a musician, I have a  responsibility. I have in my hands a "very  important tool...to be on stage and communicate to large groups of people. That  Is it difficult to tour in Chile?  Yes, it's very difficult to live for music  in Chile. Most of my work is done for solidarity, about what's going on...it doesn't  pay much'.  How do you survive then?  I don't knowI I do the odd thing here, the  odd concert there. I try to organize my own  things to make a bit of money. I'm always  scrambling to make an existance.  Do you work with a group in Chile?  I just finished recording with a group  called Santiago del Nuevo Estremo^ The  kind of music I like to do is popular  music. I like jazz and blues. I'm trying  to break from the very traditional view  of what political music is, that being  with the traditional instruments, like the  charango,   the quena  and wearing the ponchos.  We have to break out of that 'image and find  new kinds of music. It's not that I have  anything against folklore music, but that  this music isn't for everyone. We don't need  to be running around in the same uniforms  all the time.  Who has influenced your writing and singing?  A lot of people! I've had a lot of influence from jazz music, from Chilean New  Song Mavement and specifically Patricio  Manns. I've been influenced by the Cuban  Nueva Trova and all the way up to Bob  Iferley!  continued page 33 22   July/ August TO Kinesis  Kinesis July/August TO   23  PLAYING   ON   THE    EDGE  by Isis  Rachel Melas, Filis Iverson, Maura  Volante and I are local musicians active  in the alternative scene.  We got together to discuss the relationship between  our music and politics.  Isis:  Right now I'm playing in one  band, Rockin' Harry and the Hackjobs,  and a lot of the appeal of that band  for me is that we -do play benefits and  things like that.  Rachel:  My name is Rachel and I play  the bass in the Animal Slaves and Rockin'  Harry and the Hackjobs. How about you  Phyllis, what's your function in the  Filis: I play bass in the Industrial  Waste Banned, and in the basement and  sometimes in the livingroom.  Maura: I'm Maura Volante, and I'm "just  a singer", and I also play some percussion. I was working with Liquid Wrench.  Isis:   I'm interested in a lot of things,  how is our music integrated with our  politics; what kind of music do we  choose to play and why; where do we  choose to play; how do we work together. Maybe that's a good place to  start, how do we write our music?  Rachel:  The Animal Slaves write collectively. We just go down there, and we  start playing. There are power struggles  in every band, people like to get their  egos out to the world and they like to  express themselves through their music.  It's really close to the bone, very personal. If you write with people you have  to really trust them, whether they're  girls or boys.  Filis:  We write quasi-collectively,  but we all go over the lyrics and see  if we agree on what we're saying. A lot  of whatever is said reflects the views  of everybody, not just the writer.  The lyrics I've written are usually something I feel quite strongly about, and  it's the same, I think, for everybody  else in the band. Things like housewives  going insane, being brought up to be  nice. About how all your life you're  told—women don't do this, women don't  do that. Also we have songs about people  in prison, and the environment.  Isis:  Rockin' Harry's lyrics are not  particularly political   Rachel:  Not at all—"I wanna love you..."  Isis:  Some of them are, but what we're  doing is- political beyond the songs themselves. Even realizing that we're all  women up there, on stage playing the  instruments. And we get really rocking  at times. It surprises people, and it  also inspires other women to start  playing too.  Maura:  I was thinking about that when  Liquid Wrench played the anarchafeminist  benefit house party. All the equipment  was there, and women who normally don't  have access to a drum set or electric  instruments were jamming. That felt  like a really good function of the band  too. There's a lot of ways to be a  resource to the community.  Rachel: The Animal Slaves don't play a  lot of benefits. Our songs aren't overtly political but if you look at us we  put out an extremely rebellious, weird  vibe. And who knows...it's just something else in the world.  Maura: I think that the Animal Slaves  are a political entity in.terms of the  lyrics. They're not the typical love  songs that you hear on the radio, and  musically it's quite a different style,  it's challenging. It's important to do  stuff that's outside the consumer trip  in music because they can really control us if they can control what we  listen to.  Rachel:  I think our last gig was an adequate representation of what we're trying  to do. (Rockin' Harry and IWB at Vancouver'  Venue )~it was a great gig because it catalyzed people's approach to alternative  culture. There were a lot of women, gay  women really aware men, and people of  colour together with a lot of different  kinds of music and political perspectives.  And it doesn't have to be a benefit necessarily but rather, just a place where  people can go who feel that way. At least  you have an alternative, you can see  people doing something you like, and it's  happening.  Filis:  I think that when people come to  alternative gigs, whether it's at a  straight club or not, they come because  they want to see what you're doing.  Rachel:  And support you. And they are  supporting you in a really concrete way  because when that club gives you a guarantee or whatever, and you get your crowd  out, they see there is some support for  this kind of music and they'll be more likely to hire other weird bands in the future.  Maura: I have sung at rallies. I don't see  as much use being made of musicians at  those events. There could be either musicians, poets or theatre people there. I  think that's another way for the political  community to support artists and cultural  workers. It would be a lot more interesting for everyone.  Rachel:  For sure. Politics without culture  is a big zero.  Maura:  That's something that the Latin  American workers have really got in their  movement; a lot more feeling for music as an  integral part of the struggle. I don't think  that Chilean upheaval in the sixties would  ever have happened without Violetta Para,  Victor Jara and all those people who really  catalyzed that political movement.  Filis:  Vancouver is notorious for having  totally boring demos. If they had some music  it would probably pick things up.  Rachel:  It's really going down the tubes, the  whole demonstration thing.  Maura:  Even at the recent South African demo  there were no black people speaking and no  black people making music.  Rachel:  Were there any black people there?  Maura:  There were, but not speaking, and the  organizers didn't have enough music. What  there was was very white sounding...folky.  Isis:  For a long time I've been meaning to get  together a little press kit with information  from local musicians, and give it to all  these progressive groups, saying we're available, give us a call, we like to do things  like this. Because they don't think of us a  lot of times. Or if they do they think, "It  will be so much work."  Maura:  It's like the musicians are an  afterthought—"We'll have to have a  song to open"—but they're, not thinking  that what the musicians would choose  to do at an event would very often be  IIlllllI^M^^^^^^^M^^^^P  Resisting the Musical    Rip-Off  by Maura Volante  It is very difficult for me to see...that a  non-singing people^can ever be free.  Bernice Johnson 1  Movements for change have always had their  music. In pre-electric times and places,  music has carried the news, has inspired  people and has been used extensively in  direct healing.  But the main function of music in a movement or a community is the making of music,  rather than the listening to it. It is as  natural to sing and play instruments as it  is to eat and breathe. It is a way to express thoughts and feelings, together, and  is one of the most powerful unifying activities for groups, large and small.  The bosses have attempted many times in  many ways to destroy peoples' musical traditions. On the plantations of the Americas, for instance, instruments were taken  from the-African slaves, along with most  of their time and energy. But the people  kept on singing, and made instruments out  of cast-offs, keeping African music alive.  Black people were still singing when the  black liberation movement grew in the  sixties, showing the progressive white  movements how important it is to include  musical participation in political events.  Women don't have an identity as a group  with a unifying musical tradition, as the  blacks have had in the Americas. Women  have been there in every musical tradition, to a greater and lesser extent,  and so we work in a variety of musical  forms. (Women are socialized into the  softer forms such as folk, country,  pop and classical, but have also  persisted in the rock and jazz worlds).  There is a particular difference in  the energy of women's compositions,  surfacing in all forms, but there is no  such thing as an all-encompassing  women's music.  This diversity and isolation within  different musical worlds has made women  particularly vulnerable to the more  sophisticated methods of muting that  have emerged with recording and broadcasting technology. Radio, television,  records and tapes now dominate the  space so much that there's no need to  take away our instruments.  Of course, what is used against us can  be an important tool to use for ourselves, and I appreciate the technology that allows me to hear music from  the other side of the world, or to  listen to a tape of a band rehearsal  at home and work on my parts. Listening to recorded music from  the other side of the world, or to  listen to a tape of a band rehearsal  at home and work on my parts. Listening to recorded music is broadening for  my own music and gives me a band to  dance to whenever I want.  However, the consequence of increased  dependence on recorded music is the  atrophy of the musical aspects of ourselves and of our music.  Children grow up now with a very different relationship to music than they  did a hundred years ago. At that time,  music was made in homes, churches,  sometimes in concerts; mostly a neighbourhood and family activity. It wasn't  on 24 hours a day. It was a gift each  time, and different every time. A  child would hear her mother and other  people in the home singing briskly on  a winter morning, languidly on a hot  summer day, and sleepily, at a 4 am  feeding.  Now, a song is heard as a frozen moment  in time, or several moments frozen together, through multi-track recording.  Only the best moment is chosen, and it's  electronically modified to sound more  slick, more full, more balanced, than  any one moment in time could ever be.  That is what children are growing up  with as their main, sometimes their  only, source of musical modelling. From  home to daycare to school, more and  more recorded music is being used as a  background sound with no relation to  the child's own voice and hands.  Very small children will still make  music spontaneously. They haven't yet  received the message about who can and  who can't make music. Often the first  silencing agent is a well-meaning parent asking a child who is singing a  semi-conscious improvisation as she  plays,' "Oh, what song are you singing  dear?" to which the child has no  answer, because she doesn't know how  to label it. She learns from this interaction 'that she's supposed to sing  songs  and' that songs sound a particular  way.  It's not nice, we don't  play nice music.  It moves my guts.  I get a feeling inside  from it.  Industrial Waste Banned in an earlier incarnation  as powerful a statement on the politics  of that particular situation as anything  in any of the speeches. Maybe we could  look at the way we choose the forms of  music that we do. Like why we do rock  or blues or folk or whatever.  Filis:  I never played anything before  I played bass. I liked the bass, and I  wanted to play the bass, so I got a  bass. I listened to all kinds of music,  but I worked Out my own bass lines. I  don't like commercial pop music, and  the stuff on the radio.  Maura:  Do you like the so-called "women's  music"?  Filis:  To tell you the truth, I really  hate it.  Rachel:   It's lame.  Filis:  It's whining...  Rachel:   ...it's incestuous.  Filis:  It's cultural masturbation.  It's not challenging in any sense of  the word.  Isis:  If "women's music" is, and I  won't argue with you, "whining, incestuous, and not challenging", what's coming  out in your music that differentiates  it?  Filis:  It's not nice, we don't play  nice music. It moves my guts. I get a  feeling inside from it. I'm not saying  that our music is totally great. I can't  dance to our stuff either. But to me,  it feels like something.  Rachel:  Your music is challenging. You  really have to put energy into it to get  anything out of it. It's not mellow,  soothing music that you can nod out to  or read a book to.  Musical politics continued next page  mSBmMSBSSmm  WBsm.  In school, children are taught, painstakingly, to sing cute children's songs.  These are written, not for the comfort  of young voices, but for the entertainment of adults, for whom they will  bravely sing these dreadful things at  a school concert. Far from developing  children's ability to sing or maybe  even create music, this kind of program weeds out the ones who will then  be labelled non-musical, and pushes  those who can keep up into a strictly  defined musical form which is often alien  to everything else in children's lives.  What a choice I To drop out (or be asked to  mouth the words) or to continue in a musical moulding derived mainly from white  elite traditions. It's no wonder the majority of people I speak with about singing tell me flat-out that they can't sing.  mercially manipulated, does not serve to  encourage the musical sides of most people.  What is essential to that encouragement is  the music of friends and family, playing.  and singing, showing each other that it's  fun even if it doesn't sound like the  record.  The Shona people of Southern Africa say,  "If you can talk you can sing. If you can  walk you can dance."  What it takes is being open to the sounds  of each other's music. Just as we are  learning to accept and welcome the diversity in our bodies, we must learn to welcome each other's voices and what we can do  with instruments. It may sound disturbing  for awhile, but it's still fun to do it  and it can't help but sound better if you  keep doing it.•  Just as we are learning to accept and welcome the diversity  in our bodies, we must learn to welcome each other's voices  what we can do with instruments.  There are parallels to this specialization  in other areas, too, such as athletics.  Those who are good at it are pushed into  a competitve funnel, while those who aren't  good are weeded out, to let their muscles  atrophy from lack of use until it is  indeed true that they can't run or throw  a ball.  In visual art as well, the good ones are  allowed to get better, within a framework  of what's considered good, while others  "realize" that they aren't artistic and  let the visually creative parts of themselves atrophy.  Obviously, each of us has special gifts  for particular creative forms, putting more  energy into the development of certain  skills than others. And those who excel  in a form can be examples of how that  form can be used.  But the impossible modelling of a singer  who has come through the competitive  funnel, electronically modified and corn-  Many of us who want to be strong and resist  are engaged in acts of resistance every  day. Much of this activist work is tiring  and emotionally draining. It is in these  tired spaces that we are vulnerable to  the lure of television, escape novels or  bland commercial music. We need to engage  in emotionally nourishing activities when  we are verging on burn-out. Sometimes it  seems like too much trouble to actually  do  something, but the wonder of doing  creative work, such as making music, is  that it is emotionally nourishing as well  as being, in itself, a further act of  resistance to the mainstream culture  business.  It is an act of resistance to make music  with children, enjoying with them the  creation of songs of the moment.  It is an act of resistance to sing on city  streets. It is an act of resistance to make  music in the home, in the workplace, in the  world. 24   July/August TO Kinesis  Folk Festival  Women's line-up promises diversity  by Maura Volante  "Something for everyfolk" is the catch  phrase this year for the ninth annual  Vancouver Folk Music Festival, with a  line-up that promises the kind of diversity we have come to expect from this  three-day festival of music and theatre,  held at Jericho Park, July 18, 19 and  20.  This diversity is reflected in the women's  representation as well. Women are coming  from many .areas of North America and from  England.  More jazz is happening this year, and  Swingshift brings together a jazz feel  with political lyrics and strong vocals.  In addition to their usual combination of  drums, bass, piano, flute, sax and vocals,  the five women do an a capella set to fully  showcase the vocals and to be adaptable to  all settings, including rainy demonstrationst  Swingshift has been on the progressive community scene in the San Francisco area for  five years, showing how polished you can  get, even when you do other work and play  a lot of beneifts.  Joolz is another example of the broaden-  .ing of the scope of the folk festival. A  poet of the rock culture of northern  England, Joolz writes with a sometimes  acid tongue, expressing the feelings of a  variety of characters.  Denise \'~ --K. =*~L  Then ap 17 they told her Sorry,  there's  no work  No mills,  no shops,  no chance to earn  the cash she 'd dreamed of  Just another scrapheap schooleaver  Sign here and join the growing queue  She sulked around the Youth Club  Laughing at the social workers  who told her how to make every penny last  Told her that she'd get satisfaction  From surviving and not t  Swingshift  Presenting herself in a theatrical way,  with attention to costume and style,  she's a performance poet, one of a  growing number who are taking poetry out  of the bookstores and into the clubs.  -Last year there were only a few black  women, and it seems that this year as  well, the numbers are low, but certainly  their presence will be felt.  Queen Ida is a singer, accordionist and  leader of the Bon Temps Zydeco Band.  Zydeco music is a rich Louisiana blend of  French, English and African influences,  that is guaranteed to get you up and  dancing.  And what can I say about Sweet Honey in  The Rock? That I was mesmerized by this  a capella singing group in 1975, and fall  into their spell every time I hear them.  These women have brought black American  women's voices to more white audiences  than any other I know, drawing thousands  of us into a deeper consciousness—of  black experience, of our responsibilities  to work against racism, and to the magic  of music as a tool of resistance.  Obviously there are more women coming to  the festival than I can talk about here.  Lucie Blue Tremblay out of Quebec, Christine Lavin from New York, the Kentucky  Warblers, Marcia Taylor, etc. I will try  to find out who all these folks are at  the festival and tell you about them  afterwards.  But I do want to mention two women who  are part of the Vancouver Folk-Song  Society. Lyn McGown sings with and without Michael Pratt at rallies and coffeehouses around town, and Hilda Thomas has  continued to sing and play with Phil  Thomas through an intense schedule of  teaching commitments and political activity. It is good to see the folkloric work  of the VFSS recognized this year, and  it's good to see some local women on the  program.  Musical politics continued from previous page  Isis:  I always wanted to play loud and play  electric. It took me a long time because  I didn't know anyone else who was into it...  and I didn't have an amplifier to plug my  guitar into. There is a whole element of  subversion and rebellion in electric music  in the roots of rock.  Maura: The "women's music" industry does  not represent the whole picture of what  women with a political consciousness are  doing, musically. Using the term "women's  music" to describe one segment of a diverse scene is an insult to all the women doing other kinds of music.  Isis:  And all the women who listen to  other music. You really notice it with a  lot of the young women, they're just not  into it.,It seems to be a phenomenon of  the women who came through the sixties  and early seventies, when there wasn't  anything, and it was really significant  to have women run record labels—that  was the first. These women were speaking  to a culture. But now feminism is so much  broader, and there's so many things that  they don't speak■:to a whole lot of us.  And like you were saying, it never was  the music of all women. But what about our  music—has it changed anything?  Rachel:  It's changed my life quite a bit.  seven  Isis:  That's a great answer,  words or less.  Filis:  I think that's the only  Maura: I don't think that's quite true.  Your music has changed my life as well,  and, that's probably true for us all.  Rachel:   I've played for a lot of people  over the years and I've got some good  response from some and been ignored by  others, so who knows? I've raised a lot  of money for this and that, but who cares;  I've put a lot of money back into the  economy too. In fact, the Animal Slaves  are thinking of doing an ad for PetroCan—  Animal Slaves circle the globe In their  pick up truck, we're keeping the Canadian  economy afloat singlehandedly. Kinesis July/ August TO   25  Vancouver Folk Song Society"  A stage for professionals or first-timers  by Nola Johnston  "And we won 't be free until the humble  women speak, No, we won't be free until  the humble women speak, No, I won't let  the world turn my head around... "  I am standing in front of a microphone  at the International Women's day concert,  singing a song made by For the Moment,  an a cappella group of black women from  Halifax. Beside me stand Lynn McGown,  the Euphonious Feminists and Aya, belting out the refrain in multiple harmonies. Earlier we sang at the IWD rally,  standing on the Art Gallery steps amidst  a multitude of banners. Women are  singing along, when I think: hey, these  people are listening'. And I think: How  on earth did I get here?  Ten years ago and more I had a guitar  and used to lock myself away in my room  and sing to my walls. I even used to write  the occasional (very bad) song. It was  great therapy, but I didn't accomplish  very much. Then through circuitous channels I heard about an organization of  people who sang traditional folk music.  I diffidently wandered into a get-together  one night—and I was hooked. Here were  people who sang wonderful chorus songs,  who didn't worry if a voice wasn't of the  highest quality—what closet singer could  resist?  Since its inception in 1959 the Vancouver  Folk Song Society (VFSS) has run a weekly  coffeehouse, produced a national folk  imusic magazine, and presented concerts,  workshops, and much more. But at the  heart of the Society is the Folk Song  Circle, also known as the "folk",  iwhich I wandered into many years ago.  On the first and third Wednesday of  every month members and friends come to  play, to sing, and to listen to others.  The open stage format provides an opportunity for musicians and singers of all  skill levels to perform three pieces  before a friendly and supportive audience.  Ten years later, I am still there. Why  am I still going? And what has all this  to do with women's music and International Women's Day? Indirectly, quite a lot.  There is a lot more to the VFSS than  those great choruses. Some of it is  expressed, some is not, most has, at  times, been the subject of disagreement.  The direction and emphasis of the Soc  iety depends on who is involved in it  at any given time. It is in fact a kind  of community.  Like any organization it has at times  suffered from the strains of irreconcilable differences of opinion between,  members. People come and go, argue and  struggle, but the structure remains,  and the central belief in the importance  of the music, despite differences regarding philosophy and direction, remains.  The VFSS is not an organization of  professional musicians, though of course,  some are included in its membership. At  a Song Circle you are as likely to  hear a terrified first-time performer as  a polished professional.  Beside me stand  Lynn McGown,  the Euphonious  Feminists and Aya,  belting out the refrain  from. Of remembering joys and sorrows  shared with the rest of the world.  . Folk music in particular is a history of  past, present, and fujture; it is the sound  of context. This is true whether it makes  direct political statements or is simply  a reflection of people's lives, whether it  is traditional or contemporary. Folk music  is a useful tool for teaching people about  themselves.  I have found it helpful, in working out my  own feminism, to have folk songs adding a  historical and social context. Much of the  history of women has been lost or suppressed,  especially that of "common" women; traditional folk music helps to preserve some of what  has gone before, contemporary "women's music  in multiple harmonies,!  This is not accidental.  The intention of the Folk is to encourage  participation at all levels and interaction  with an audience to remove, as much as is  possible, the split between performer and  audience. There is an underlying convic-!  tion that it is the music that is important and that- while it is best to do it  well, it is more essential to get people  to do it, period. For this reason less  accomplished performers are supportively  received; it is recognized that space  must be provided for people to learn and  improve.  For me, the logical extension of this was  a politicization of my view of music. I  began to see that music is not something  that simply fills a vacant bit of brain.  Nor is it a pure art form existing in a  void apart from the rest of reality. It is  the sound of celebration, of remembering  who and what you are, and where you <  WOMANVISION 02.7 f ITI  Mon. 7:30to 8:30pm  Tues. 9:30 to I0:30 pm  Feminist current affairs  and arts ^^  SUPPORTING RADIO BY AND FOR WOMEN  WOMEN & WORDS  Wed. at 9:30 pm  Past and current  readings by women  RUBYMUSIC  Fri. 7:30 to8:30pm  ^10:00 to 11:00am  ^^M usic b y worn en  WOMEN OF NOTE  Mon. at 4:00 pm  , Classical & Jazz music  THE LESBIAN SHOW  Thurs. 8:30 pm 9:30 pm  B.C.'s only lesbian  radio ^^  Write or call for your complimentary radio guide     '^p  Vancouver Co-operative Radio 337 Carrall St,     *dk    ^^  V*  puts it in context.

Some haVe remained, others  ' have moved on to other musical forms.  Women in the Folk have been nurtured as  musicians, some becoming 'polished performers, others simply losing the fear of presenting themselves in public. We have been  conditioned against standing up for so long  that it is never easy; but the VFSS has  helped.  Many women, like myself, have received  their first exposure to women's music here,  sharing with other women, educating the men,  and growing in strength. It has been an  education and politicization not only in  terms of music but of life.  You will have heard some of the songs we  sing, and you will have seen women from  the VFSS singing them. Most recently you  have probably seen musical and political  involvement from Lorraine Helgerson, Lynn  McGown, Rika Ruebsaat, and Hilda Thomas,  but there are many more of us.  We have sung at True Confessions,"at IWD,  at concerts and benefits and on street  .corners. We sing a lot of different kinds  of material, but all with a sense of  history and place.  I still get nervous when I stand'up to  sing in public, but less so. I know that  I've learned a lot. I've learned that  what counts is telling people a story  about their own lives, or those of their  sisters and brothers. I've learned that it  is important to present it well, to make it  interesting and accessible, but that the  quality of my voice matters less than the  content of the song. And I've learned that  the most important thing is that we stand .  up and speak, or sing. I learned this at  the Folk. I think we all did; it is why we  are here.

German femfnist filmmaker Margarethe  Von Trotta was in Vancouver recently  for the screening of her latest film,  The Patience of Rosa L.,   a portrait of  Polish Jewish revolutionary Rosa  Luxembourg. She spoke with Janet Duckworth about Rosa,  her earlier films and  her thoughts on film making.  Kinesis: I'd like to ask you first about  the quote in the Vancouver Sun,  where  Mark Andrews reports you as saying that  you are not a radical feminist,  do you  consider yourself a feminist or don't  you?  Von Trotta: Of course I do. I always have.  It's just these journalists, you know, they  must have simple statements for readers.  They like to be able to define you.  Because to define is in someways to conbrol'i  Von Trotta: Yes, absolutely.  Who do you make your films foi  have an audience in mind?  do you  Haunted Hamlet  On August 1 a very unusual performance  of Hamlet  opens at the Tamahnous House,  and for a feminist audience this production provides a refreshing approach to  one of the classics of the English  speaking theatre^Directed by Kathleen '  Weiss, the artistic director at Tamahnous, and adapted by playwright,  Peter Eliot Weiss, this production explores the oppression of paternalism  and examines some of the choices that  women make in a society structured by  men, and why they make them.  Jii  this adaptation the character of  Polonius (the senior state servant to  the court of Denmark) is played by a  woman. Polonius reveals the dilemma of  a woman who strives for power in a  man's world. In order to complete in  this masculine environment she sacrifices her feminine aspect. This is a  tragic choice that will ultimately  destroy her and her family.  Gertrude, Hamlet's mother and the queen,  also strives for political power. But  bowing to the dictates of a masculine  world she tries to rule through a man—  Claudius, her new husband—rather than  take power herself and function  independently of the status quo.  The character of Ophelia reveals both  the destructiveness of choosing a traditional woman's role and the paucity of  alternatives available to women in a  paternally structured society.  Director Weiss has long been associated  with alternate theatre in Vancouver and  her concept for this performance of  Hamlet  is entirely non-linear and encourages an active role for the audience."  The show will take place on three levels  of the Tamahnous House, where three  different stories will develop simultaneously. The audience may move at  will, watching whichever scenes they  wish. Thus it would be possible to  attend every show twice'.  Tamahnous ' The Haunted House Hamlet  opens August 1 at 1885 Venables St.,  Vancouver. For box office and more  information call 254-1911.  Von Trotta: No. That would be a sort of  programmatic idea. I just make films because  I love to make films and it's my life, my  obsession, my passion. So I think that  what I am living out, what I am experimenting with, and also my friends, I have many  friends especially women friends, and so. I  think that what I am living out and what I  can show people in films might be interesting for other people too. But it's not that  I say I must make films only for women, or  for a certain group of mankind (sic) it's  my expression of my feelings. It's like  other people write and do work in other  ways. For me, my work is filming.  So Would you say that to some extent the  female characters in your films represent  aspects of yourself?  Von Trotta: Yes, absolutely. That is why  I must have two women characters, at  least.  In Canada your films are very popular with  lesbian feminists. Do you think that people  take from your films what they want to take  from them? Do you think that this is in the  nature of a film anyway?  Von Trotta: Yes. I think that is good.  Alexander Kluge, one of our first new  German directors, a very intelligent man  who writes a lot about theories too, film  theory, always says that a film is finished  in the head of the people, because in every  head it's another thing, perhaps other ideas  Everybody looks in different ways and everybody gets or tries to get from the film what  is in his mind. So I agree with that.  I'm thinking of  Sheer Madness. In that  film the women were very strong,  particularly Olga,   the character that Hanna  Schygulla played.  The men were not.  They  were very weak, which I think appealed to  many women,  though not all.  Do you see  this weakness and strength as something  that's happening universally with men  and women or just in a particular setting?  Von Trotta: I don't think that the men  were weak. The men were insecure, because  this sort of friendship between women  (in Sheer Madness)  is a very new phenomenon. Men's friendship was always  accepted, it's even in the Greek myths  and there have been myths of men's  acter, it's just that he is helpless in  front of this new phenomenon.  So with women becoming stronger both in  the professional world and with them  developing new friendships with each  other,   this means men have to redefine  themselves both in relationship to women  and in relationship to each other.  Their  old position is lost,   they have to make  a redefinition which is in itself scary.  Von Trotta: Absolutely, absolutely. But  since they are still so enracines  in  their own tradition and in their old  power games and competiveness and all  that, it's...I think it's a lot of pain  for them to redefine and reflect on all  this.  It's  like in  The Patience of Rosa L.  when at one point Rosa says:   "Although  the bourgeoisis is stricken to the core,  it will fight to the death for its position. " In some ways that is a parallel  with men.  Von Trotta: I think so, yes, absolutely.  So rather than being anything inherently  brutal they are simply fighting to try  and maintain a position that is going.  Von Trotta: Yes, yes. And still we are  living on power ideas. All the patriarchy  since it has existed is based on power,  on power over others, on hierarchies. So  this is the point for men to learn really,  I think, that this patriarchal period has  to be over because we now know where it  led us. Because all this nuclear war is  now possible. It is leading us to total  destruction, and if we are not now, if  they  are not willing to redefine and  change, the world will be destroyed and  we will all go bang.  In some senses  The Patience of Rosa L.  is very different from  Sheer Madness and  your earlier films because in some ways  Rosa's very important relationships are  with men and it was interesting that when  Clara Zetkin raised the question of female  suffrage, Rosa said,   "That 's beside the  point." Did you discover in reading her  letters and while doing your research why  she didn't seem to show an interest in  so-called "women's issues"?  It is leading us to total destruction and if the patriarchy is not willing  to redefine and change, the world will be destroyed  and we will all go bang.  friendship all over the years and all  over the centuries. Friendship in war,  friendship in adventures, in fighting,  and in colonising the world, there was  always this great friendship.  Women's friendship was only accepted  when they were coming together to talk  about education of children, about the  house and all these personal things.  Now, since women are becoming more independent in their professions also, they  have to talk about other things too. So  friendship between women changed and it  became more a little bit like men's  friendship before.  So men are not used to i^his new sort of  friendship and they become helpless.  It's not weakness, it's helplessness.  They fear that they lose something, they  lose a possession of theirs. Love for  many men means possession, means to  possess the woman. Therefore, this man,  the husband in Sheer Madness,  he doesn't  know anymore how to treat this, therefore .  he becomes afraid and fear leads often  to agression, and so he becomes agressive,,  but it's not because he is a brutal char-  Von Trotta: Oh, she did. That comment was  only because at this lunch when they spoke  about women's stuff...It's in general  politicians are willing to give positions  to women but only positions they are not  interested in. So when you see in the  normal governments the ministry of family  or education and so on, that they give  away to women because they are not interested in it. They think it is not important.  It is important, family is important, but  not for them.  And that's the point Rosa refuses herself.  She said no. I want to share the important  things, not only the things that, are not  important for you. But she was not anti-  feminist or anti-women's movement. One of  her best friends was Clara Zetkin, who  was at that time the leader of the women's  movement in the Social Democratic party.  Clara Zetkin edited a newspaper called  Gleicheit (Equality). That was a magazine  for women. Rosa wrote a lot for this magazine too. So it was just a point between  Rosa and the leader of the Social Democratic party at that very moment.  I first read Rosa Luxembourg when I was  at university,  I went to the London School  of Economics,  and with Trotsky,  Lenin and  Victor Serge she was one of the cannon.  When we read her we considered ourselves  to be revolutionaries.  When you first  read her and learned of her when you were  a student,  did you consider yourself to  be a revolutionary?  Von Trotta: I still think I am a revolutionary, in some ways. I made a film  explicitly about terrorism, Marianne  and Julianne.  Your films have sometimes been criticised because the milieu they deal with  is a very bourgeois milieu. In Sheer  Madness in particular and in Marianne  and Julianne almost everyone is a  middle class intellectual. How would  you respond to that kind of criticism?  Von Trotta: I don't pretend that I am  universal or that I want to be understood by everyone. But I can speak  only of .things I know." And this middle-  class I know. I would find it pretentious to speak about a class I don't'  know and I am not living in. Because  my view in my films comes out very  often from the Inner side of the characters, so I have to deal with people  I know. At first it's a description of  a class which is just very defined and  reduced but the feelings and the people  I describe, I think you can transpose  it to other classes too.  Except that women like the one Hanna  Schygulla played and the one Angela  Winkler played (in  Sheer-Madness) have  a lot more leisure to deal with their  feelings because of the economic situation they're in. A woman who gets up  early,  works all day and then has to  cook and clean and feed her children  doesn 't have the freedom to examine  her relationships and her feelings in  the same way.  Von Trotta: Yes. But the feelings are  there. Perhaps they have no possibility  to reflect on them but watching a film  like.that, perhaps they can find the  same feelings in themselves.  In a country like Canada a working class  woman probably wouldn't go and see  your films.   Would they in Germany?  Von Trotta: On television. Not in the  cinema. They rarely go to cinemas. But  every film of ours is shown two years  later, after exposure in cinemas, on  television.  Do you ever get a response from these  people, when your films are shown on  television?  Von Trotta: Oh yes. People write to me  a lot, especially women.  Now,  I would like to ask a couple of  theoretical questions.  You are a filmmaker so you -engage in practice,  I mean  you make films.  Do you also read a lot  of theory and does it ever influence  what you do? Or is it afterwards you  read theory and say,   "Oh,   that 's what I  am doing or that 's what I did"?  Von Trotta: I used to read theories before I did films on my own. Then I read a  a lot but ndw I find it rather boring  to read all that because it disturbs  my intuition, and I'd rather have confidence in what's coming out of me just  like an unconscious flow. I have confidence in that rather than in theories.  Let them do the theories and do the  interpretation after. You can't be your  own artist and your own interpreter,  not too much.  Women are beautiful  when they are  looking like they look.  Margarethe Von Trotta  I was thinking particularly of a theory  that is quite current; that in cinema  you have an active male gaze and a passive female object; that the way women  are constructed on the screen is as  objects and as the locus of male desire;  that therefore this leaves women watching a film with nowhere to be.  Yet in  your films women are the protagonists,  they are the important ones. Do you  think in some ways in your films you  break down this relationship,  that you  give the female spectator a place to be?  Von Trotta: Absolutely. And I felt it  because in all the letters I get from  women they are very identifying and  therefore they love my films. Mainly  women, because they identify, they  have finally some figures to identify  with and not be used as objects.  Some theories talk a lot about visual  pleasure and the locus of desire. So do  you think that it is possible in films  for women to get this visual pleasure?  Also, is it possible to articulate female desire on the i  Von Trotta: I don't know. You must know  that if you interpret my films. You must  ask others not me.  What I meant was I get what I think is  visual pleasure from films made by men,  because they are very beautiful to look  at, for example  The Round Up by Miklos  Jancso,  visually it 's very beautiful,  particularly the scenes on the Hungarian  plain. So I get a little confused when  I read about visual pleasure,  I know  it's used in a very specific way,  and I  asked this question because I hoped you  might clarify it for me.  Von Trotta: Yes. Generally women in films  of male film'makers are much more beautiful, much more sterile perhaps also because they have to be the image of the  desire of men. But for me women are  beautiful when they are looking like they  look. I have not the desire to change  them to please me or to cause me an  erotic feeling or so. So for me it's the  inner side which is beautiful and so I  try to catch this.  I am often asked the difference between  men's aesthetic and women's aesthetic  in film and then I answer that we are  all,- even all the women, educated by men's  film. Because there were no films before,  when we started there were not so many  films made by women. So I started with  Bergman, with Antonioni, with Pasolini.  All these were my professors or my masters looking at their films. But the  main difference I think is that we are  choosing women for. our characters. They  are really women out of life and we  don't try to make, the make-up so pretty  and we just, portray them like we know  them from our friendships and from our  lives.  The Dutch film maker Marleen Garris,  in  her first film,  A Question of Silence  and her second film,   Broken Mirrors  chooses,  in a sense,  to reverse the roles.  So you get a very negative view of men  and instead of relocating the position  of women on the screen,  she inverts it.  For this reason her films are very unsatisfactory,  the characters are very  flat and almost boring.  Is this something  you try to avoid in your films,  this  simple reversal of polarities attempting  instead to show a whole complex person  of whatever sex?  Von Trotta: Yes, absolutely. But I am  always attacked that my men are much more  one dimensional than the women are in  my films. And that's true perhaps because  I know women from both sides, from outside and from within. And for men, I  don't. I am not able to feel myself as  a man so perhaps that's why I show, them  only how they look to me from the exterior,  less complex perhaps than my women.   ■ BetteCox  Wonderfully ambitious play  The Lost and Found by Nora D. Randall.  Directed by Susan Astley and Suzie  Payne. Starring Judith Berlin,  Celeste  Insell, Margo Kane, Angela Siu,  Yaman-  ouchi,  Etsuko. Presented by Women 's  Voices: A Vancouver Mosaic.  "Have you lost something?" asks Lily,  who staffs the city's lost and found  department, of Mrs. Johnson, a nineteenth  ■ century ghost. "Only my name," she  replies, delighted that Lily can see  her.  So begins The Lost and Found,   a play  • about the silencing of women's voices,  the difficulty in being heard, the risk  • of speaking out, the separation from one's  past and one's spirituality, the isolation  silence breeds and the silence that is  produced by isolation,  The Lost and Found represents the diversity of our women's community—the support, bickering, nurturing, frustration,  loving, the resolution of differences,  the respect for each other—as we attempt  to avoid and overcome the traps of isolation. ' Jdr  Each of the six actors plays two roles,  a ghost or spirit and a living woman.  The twelve characters include: two Japanese, two Chinese, two Native, two Caucasianj  one lesbian, one physically disabled,  one "emotionally disturbed", four first ■  generation immigrants, one of whom is  American, four mothers, three project  workers on a grant, one cleaning woman,  one printer/singer, one office worker,  one journalist, one woman who tackles issues alone, three who work collectively,  one who does not speak English, one who  does not read Chinese, and one who has  been a translator.  I'm extremely partial to ghosts of our  past trying to get in touch with us,  to spirits trying to be recognized, to  women of all ages (double entendre intended) occupying the stage together, and  I found the play ambitious, uplifting  and charming. Charm: an action, process  or thing (word, phrase or verse) supposed  to have magic or occult power. Some of  the lines are excellent, as in the difference between a ghost and a spirit:  "you don't' have to be dead to be invisible."       Ililii  At intermission I was surprised, and then,  upon reflection, not surprised, to hear  a youngish, short-haired, well dressed  man say to another man "I'm not particu  larly interested In the subject." Immediately after, an old woman with bright  eyes and a cane needed to tell me—  in answer to how she liked the play—  about her four children, one of whom  died, she had a baby chair like that  on the stage and a washboard and buggy  and her life wasn't easy in 1922...~  Cultural and racial heritage is the  theme most developed in the second act  of The Lost and Found, precipitated by  the lost women's discovery of Surjit'sv  spirit in the storeroom. (Both Surjit  and her mother, Jaswinder, are excellently portrayed by Veena Sood.)  Surjit, the teenager, represents future  and vision. All women unite around this  crisis. Lily risks being thought "crazy"  by telling the others that there are  lost women as well as lost objects in  the storeroom.  Six monologues follow, addressed to the  living women/audience. After the frequently fast-paced and witty interaction  between ghosts and living in the first  act, two of the monologues sounded like  textbooks—that of the Native woman, Bell  Nah Naak (regally protrayed by Margo  .Kane), and Muriel KItagawa's account of  the Japanese-Canadian's internment.  I wanted to know what effect becoming a  translator and marrying the Hudson's  Bay Factor had on Bell Nah Naak's personal life more'than I wanted to hear  about alcohol, guns and disease. Her  line of message, "you are valuable in  your community", while textually splendid, was polemic overdrive. I also  wanted to know more about Muriel's  desperation in not being attended to  when she wrote against racism than I  wanted a description of how everyone  was silenced by the internment.  However, Mrs. Johnson's courage in  ' testifying before the 1896 Commission  on Lunacy moved me very much. So did  Rosa's bravery in opening a restaurant  with only enough money for two chickens.  These are specifics from women's lives,  and it is through specific detail that  one touches the viewers' emotions and  avoids polemic.  Again, the most poignant part of Chu  Mbi Lan's account is her knitting cowichan  sweaters for four dollars and discovering the store sells them for fifty.  Though I wondered what Bell Nah Naak  thinks of immigrant women knitting  Revealing photos  The title piece of this exhibit of photographs by Bette Cox, on till July 5/86  at the West End Community Centre, shows  a broken, boarded-up window in a crumbling  brick wall. "It's what's behind  the window that I'm showing you," says Bett.  "Like looking benind the wall of someone's  personality."  Bett's pictures do have a sense of .secrets  revealed. In one photo, the massive, root  structure of two tree trunks is exposed,  but unnaturally exposed, as if the photographer had x-ray vision.  Other works are haunting. One untitled  photo of a vacant chair against the wall  of a burnt-out gas station—"so low-contrast it's almost colour," says Bett—has  a real ghostly, dreamy feel, as if the  chair were still occupied...  What attracts Bett to old abandoned or  discarded objects? "I wonder, how did  it get there? Why  is it there? There's  a story behind every photo."  Bett is also drawn to the abstracts of  nature forms and the beauty of wild  creatures. One photo of a wood duck  has startling charity; another shows the  soft grey of a twisted branch on softer  white snow.         *^S*3<i?  Bett has been taking pictures for the  past ten years. She lists as favorite  photographers Annie Liebowitz, David  Hamilton and her father (a photographer  in Victoria).

I felt the cultural counterpoint most  strongly in the conflict between Jaswinder and her daughter, and unassertive  Jaswinder manifests the growth for all  characters when she tells her boss  she's taking the afternoon off: "tough  beans to you!" Lily, who is about to  lose the job she has had for eight years  through the unwitting actions of the  project women, acts as a metonym for  the way in which women are divided against  each other.  The Lost and Found  is wonderfully ambitious in its attempt to pull the past  into the present and —if not map the  future, at least place a stone for the  next step. To fault an effort because  it is too ambitious is to fault our feminist vision. The play suffers from the  roughness and rawness of too little  time. It needs work to cut out the didacticism—all speeches are too long and  polemical—and to push dramatic moments  to their potential.  The Lost and Found  is a poignant, empowering, and fun statement about us, the  women of Vancouver in 1986. As such, it  • is a statement about all women. It ends  on the note of reclamation and acceptance of all our lost women and our lost  selves; a.revisioning of the past in the  present which is necessary to envision  the future. To let The Lost and Found  be silenced after only ten performances  is to have it become its own message:  we lose much of what is good.  Frances (Sandy) Duncan is a Vancouver  writer.

'  '      ii "   '  ■ Kinesis July/August TO   29  ARTS  Essays intriguing and irresistable  by Terri L. Jewell  Black Feminist Criticism: Perspectives  on Black Women Writers by Barbara Christian.  Elmsford,  New York: Pergamon Press,  Inc.,   1985.   261 pages.   $29.95 hardcover,  $13.50 softcover.  This collection of essays, written by  Barbara Christian, Associate Professor  in the Afro-American Studies Department  at the University of California, Berkeley, is an acutely intelligent and  irresistible resource for both the literary scholar and the lesiurely reader  interested or curious about the published  works of black women. May I quickly add  this book is not a dry lesson on literary  elements but stands as an intriguing  examination of the historical and contem- ■  porary traditions of black woman as writer/  storyteller/artist, mother/sister/daughter/  lover/worker.  In her first essay, Black Women in Afro-  American Literature,   Christian discusses  the early emergence of published novels  in which the "tragic mulatto" prevailed  to please the white and publishing audience. Other stereotypes—the mammy,  the voodoo root woman, Sapphire—were widespread and indicated the black woman's  place  outside white and moral lady-hood.  Christian provides a general overview of  the strong cultural and folk influences  in black women's writing and articulates  her thoughts on how feminist issues of  race, sex and class are approached in the  Zora Neale Hurston  literature of Zora Neale Hurston, Ann  Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Paule Marshall,  Nikki Giovanni and Toni Morrison.  In the essays that follow, Christian  explores in depth the power and honesty of Alice Walker's poetry and prose.  In her writing on Walker, Christian introduces the concept of agwu,   or personal spirit, that seeks truth despite  societal customs and restrictions.  What happens when a black woman goes  against conventvon,   transgresses a  deeply felt taboo,  and says no_ directly  and aloud?  >f  Such a woman strikes at the heart  hierarchy, which is central to  and sexism,   two variants of the patr-  archal view, of life.  Indigenous to the black community is  idea of contrariness  attributed to  women who seek a route to rebellion,  resistence against a troubling norm.  Other routes are insanity and murder  which are examined in Walker's work and  run within the thematic concerns of  other black writers.  Some attention is given to the creative  process of novelist Toni Morrison in  three essays which probe her use of  place, or community, in relation to her  development of characters.  Like the ancestral African tradition,  place is as important as the human  actors,  for the land is a participant  in the maintenance of the folk tradition.  In "The Concept of Class", Morrison's  four novels—The Bluest dfye, Sula,  Song of Solomon,   and Tar Baby—are put *  to task in exposing the oppression of  America's standard of (white) beauty,  definitions of woman  and lady,   and  materialistic aspirations which systematically devalue black women and require  total denial of self for acceptance.  The novels of Paule Marshall cross these  same thematic lines. Her books are firmly rooted in her Caribbean background  What happens when  a black woman says no  directly and aloud?  and each one approaches the problem qf  nurturing a culture in America that is  not Euro-centric, of preserving a community and a past and still reaping the  fortunes of a country that detests you.  In a piece written in 1982, Christian  confronts the historical development  of a black and female poetic aesthetic  in the face of the sad fact that:  StilI,   today,  forms that are specifically '  Afro-American in nature, whether poetry,  painting,  or music, are continually  threatened by the dominance of Euro-  American aesthetic concepts.  And she addresses universality in literature that excludes the wide and  rich influences of Afro-centric art  and culture.  No More Buried Lives,   Christian's exploration of the theme of lesbianism  in Lorde's Zami,  Naylor's The Women-of  Brewster Place,   Shange's Sassafras,  Cypress and Indigo  and Walker's The  Colour Purple  was disappointing due  to her chosen approach to the analysis:  I think it is important that I make  clear the definition of lesbianism  that I am using in this exploration.  By lesbian I do not mean women-identified women,  feminists, or women who  are loving and supportive of other  women.  I specifically mean women who  find other women sexually attractive  and gratifying.  The Alexander  Technique  Relieves back pain, excessive  fatigue, poor posture and physical  tension.

JULIA BRANDRETH (604) 689-8327  She does acknowledge the limitations  of this less than enlightening approach.  Nevertheless, she does perform an  honest examination of the mentioned  works in the context of how lesbianism  is viewed by the community on the outside looking in. And there are disturbing problems of racism, intolerance  and class hierarchy within the lesbian  community itself.  Alice Walker I  There could have been more of an analysis of African women's literature in  Alternate Versions of the Gendered  Past.  There is so little opportunity  to taste the lives of Bessie Head,  Flora Nwapa and Aimee Aa'too through  their own words, to touch our own  selves and realize the source of  creative strength that is shared on  our mother continent. Also, more selective editing would have eliminated  some of the lengthy and repetitious  references made to certain novels,  although the nature of Christian's  book, composed of kindred pieces  over a ten-year period, makes the  tendency somewhat unavoidable.  The irony in the title of this particular  essay of Christian's rests in  her omission of the contribution  that black lesbians have made in  black feminist theory, in the women's  movement, in the voice of women's  literature from the very beginning.  Not only is the theme  of lesbianism  being examined and becoming more  acceptable in today's literature,  but black lesbians are writing about;  their own lives and in turn, the  lives of all black women and,  finally, of all women.  The intensity of Barbara Christian's  body of essays matches that of creating and maintaining as a black woman  artist in this country and exemplifies a level of craft and scholarly  devotion that must be nourished and  honored.

Desert Hearts is based on Jane Rule's  Desert Of The Heart. Set in the late  1950's,  the novel tells the story of  how two very different women meet and  eventually become lovers.  The story  takes place in Reno, Nevada.  Desert Hearts was presented as part of  the Women in Focus programme at the  film festival*  Kinesis:  When did you first get bitten  by the movie bug?  Deitch:  I saw this film by Luis Bunel  called Los Olvidados.   I think it was  the first film I saw which made me  really take an interest in motion pictures.  What was it about this film which  attracted you?  Deitch:  I think it was the gutsy reality of the characters in the story...  I had never seen a film like that before, it really did something to me...  made me do a double-take.  How old were you at that time?  Deitch:   I would have been in high  school.  You were working for awhile as a camera-person on documentaries.  What made  you move away from your role as a  crafts person and into directing?  Deitch:  I was really directing first.  I was making little independent films,  avant-guarde and documentaries. But I  was shooting them myself. So I was  doing it all simultaneously—directing,  shooting and cutting them all.  When you started making your documentaries, were you thinking of eventually moving into dramatic film?  Deitch: No. At the time I was doing  them (documentaries), that's all I  had on my mind.

Deitch:  I began in Berkeley when I was  in college and I made some documentaries about the free speech movement,  the  people's park—political documentaries.  And then the ones I did later—one was  called Woman to Woman,   a documentary  about hookers, housewives and other  mothers and another was called The  Great Wall of Los Angeles about the  painting of the longest mural in the  world.  What was the focus of Woman to Woman?  Deitch:  The first part was historical  and it showed how women's work and  roles have changed since the turn of  'the century, by decade, with the music  of the time behind it.  The balance  was discussions between hookers,  housewives and other mothers talking  about their work and their lives.  I'm interested in your transition from  documentary to dramatic film,  they  seem like very different skill areas...  ■ Deitch: Well, I think that the goals  of a documentary are really the same  as a dramatic film. You really just  want to get the character; you want  the truth in the character. If somebody is playing themselves, you want  to relax them in such a way that when  you're filming what they do in their  What was the hardest thing for you in doing  Desert Hearts?

I  had a very good cast and a very good crew.  But there were some people that I did  fire,  when we started out. That was one of  the hardest things to do,  I think—firing  people. When you have a project that is  only six or twelve weeks in duration,  you  really have to make those decisions quickly and act on them.  They don't ask John Schlesinger if he will continue to make men's films.  real life they can carry on in an  uninhibited or natural way, in a way  that you don't feel the camera is  watching them. And with an actor who  is going into a character, you want  the truth in the character and you  have to work with the actor to get  to the same goal.  What attracted you to Jane Rule 's novel,  Desert of the Heart?  Deitch:  I think that it was the central  metaphor of the story, because I felt that  it would translate well to the screen.  The idea of the risk of gambling that was  inherent in the main characters' relationship, set in the context of that gambling  ■ scene In Reno. I think that is what I  found most appealing about the book. I  also really liked the characters, the  setting, and the area.  How did you manage to survive,  emotionally and financially,  that three year  period it took you to raise the money to  make  Desert Hearts?  Deitch:  Emotionally, it was my friends and  people I' was close to. Financially, I did  manage to raise some money out of escrow  (a locked-in bank account set up to facil-  iate any kind of financial deal) and I  got some grant money that I used for expenses . Some investors did put their money  up outside of escrow that I could use. as  capital and also I had savings; I had  other businesses I was in...all sorts of  other things, you know, just hustling.  How were you able to convince some of the  more doubting potential investors since  Desert Hearts was not the usual mainstream  script and it was your first feature film  project?  Deitch:  Well, a variety of ways but I think  what was more convincing than anything  i else was my obsession and my passion about  H it. I mean it's hard to state specific  things that I did but it was my attitude, ,  I think, more than anything else.  Can you describe the key to your success  with  Desert Hearts?  Deitch:  Well, I one time read this thing  that Bunel said about if you really believe  in something; if you have a real passion  and obsession about something...chances  are that there are other people who share  the same feeling...it's sort of that finger  on the pulse concept. In this case, I  think that's what it was. I was driven to  tell this story and I raised the money and  I made the film and then it's out there  being released and suddenly there's all  these people, lines around the block, who  want to see it.  The casting in  Desert Hearts is so  strong—even the secondary or supporting  characters are unforgettable.  What do you  look for when you are casting a part?  Deitch:  You imagine a character, as a  director, and then you look for some of  that energy or essence of that character  in the actor's interpretation. The actor  also has to be physically believable in  the part. With Helen Shaver, it was important that there be a chemistry between  her and Patricia Charbonneau (who played  Cay Riivers).  Now that the movie is getting a lot of  attention,  do you find the media continually asking you if you're a feminist?  Diet ah:  No not really. What I am usually  asked is would it have been easier for  you to direct this picture if you had  been a man? How can I know the answer to  that-r-I'm not a man. Or they ask me if  I will continue to make "women's films".  You know, most directors are men. They  don't ask John Schlesinger {Midnight  Cowboy; Day of the Locust)if he will  continue to make "men's'pictures". It's  like the oracle of the obvious. They have  labeled or pigeon-holed you in some  way. I make films—I happen to be a  woman, ,so I make films from the perspective of a woman. Kinesis July/August TO   31  ARTS  by Melanie Conn  In the last few years, writers, reviewers and anthologists have been describing  everything from old-fashioned ghost  stories to encounters with aliens from  other planets as "speculative fiction".  While the lines between the various categories have always been somewhat blurred,  the distinctions still have some meaning  for me, especially when I'm choosing books  to read or recommend.  The books I classify as speculative fiction  are those whose central theme is  the exploration of contemporary life  (politics, economics, social behaviour)  from the vantage point of the future,  near or distant. Orwell's Nineteen Eighty  Four  (written in 194-8) is a classic  example, as is Ursula Le Guin's latest  work, Always Coming Home.  And from the  reviews, The Handmaid's Tale,  by Margaret  Atwood sounds like speculative fiction.  The other categories that interest me are  science fiction  and fantasy.  Though they,  too, provide some commentary on modern  life, the plot is the essential element.  Science Fiction I define as futuristic,  featuring travel through space as we±l  as time. In science fiction earth is  an important reference point, as a launching pad, or as a long-lost home.  Fantasy adventures, on the other hand,  occur in their own self-contained time  and space, and rely heavily on magic  and the supernatural.  While many books have elements of several  categories, there's often more of an  emphasis in one direction. The books for  review this month are a perfect example  of the problem of classification: all  three' are futuristic, relate to some  contemporary issues, and have space  travel as an important pxot element. But,  according to my "rules", Darkchild  is  fantasy because of the magical powers  of the major characters, and the other  two books are science fiction.  Admittedly, these distinctions are somewhat arbitrary! I'd be interested in  other people's definitions. If readers  write me, c/o Kinesis,  we'll print some  opinions in the September issue.  1. Darkchild,  by Sydney J.   Van Scyoc,  Berkeley paperback,  1982,   249 pages  $3.50  Darkchild  is set in a matriarchal world  where the inhabitants live in small communities under the leadership of wise-  women—Barohnas—who have awesome  elemental powers. They can absorb and  radiate the sun's energy, animate stone  to defend their way of life and communicate telepathically with the planet's  animals. Barohnas also enjoy intense,  symbiotic and lifelong relationships with  each other.  Within this unusual culture, the book is  really a psychological study about growing  up and resolving internal conflicts. One  of the main characters is Khira, a young  woman in line to be Barohna after her  mother steps down. As Khira sturggles in  her adolescent rebellion against her destiny, Darkchild falls into her life, literally dropped from an alien spaceship,  he has been programmed by his masters to  be an instrument for information gathering. Only gradually, though, is the nature  of his identity revealed.  What I liked best about this book was the  slow and subtle unfolding of the characters as they approach self-knowledge. The  process is assisted by Kadura, a wonderfully sensitive, retired Barohna who  encourages Khira and Darkchild to accept  the ambiguities in each other. The ultimate  resolution of their identity conflicts  has much in common with good therapy. I'm  looking forward to reading J!  the sequel.  2. The Exile Waiting, by Vonda Mclntyre,  TOR paperback, 1985 (revised), 248 pages,  $3.50  You can count on Vonda Mclntyre to  write about women who are both belive-  able and remarkable. In The Exile Waitings  (first published in 1975 and  revised last year for this edition)  Mischa is as tough as they come, fight-  ' ing for her life and her dignity in  Center, the last city of Earth. Although  the city's dome protects the inhabitants  from radiation and black dust storms,  the people live underground in tiny  niches carved out of earth and rock.  A handful of families control the air,  water, food and energy supplies as well  as the launching pad to freedom. The  theme of the book, not surprisingly,  is liberation.  Mi cha's determination to escape off-',"'  world is repeatedly frustrated by  formidable obstacles, from a mind-link  with a demanding sibling to an apparently indestructable tracking device. But  throughout her adventures, Mischa is  always conscious of subtler forms of  tyranny—a brother's addiction to drugs  and despair, a friend's obsession with  the past and above all, the mindset of  the people of Center who "would never*  leave their caves, even for freedom.  They were too frightened qf the outside.  They were accustomed to their fear of  Center's rulers."  Mischa is also vulnerable to fear and  loss, but like a good political worker,  she challenges herself 'and all around  her to dare to be free.  3. Daughters of a Coral Dawn, Katherine  V. Forrest, The Naiad Press, 1984, 226  pages, $11.25.  If you like books about brilliant,  beautiful and passionate women who create  their own community on their own planet,  you'll love Daughters of a Coral Dawn.  It's a very entertaining story about  4,144  brilliant, beautiful and passionate women who engineer a clever escape  from earth under the guidance of Mother,  her nine amazing daughters and their  chosen leader, Megan. The daughters, each  named for a Greek goddess, are also  specialists in essential areas: physics,  EMILY'S PLACE  Women's retreat and vacation getaway on Vancouver Island.

An indigenous, woman-  eating monster lurks in a lake (aptly  named after Phyllis Schafly) and a  fiercely destructive nightly wind challenges Megan's latent engineering talent.  There's an invasion, too, but I don't  want to give away.the plot.  There's no lack of erotic scenes, but  some readers may object to Forrest's  consistent descriptions of female beauty  in very traditional terms: "blade-slender",  "perfectly formed body", "smooth and  taut skin", etc.  What I didn't like was the books's constant affirmation of the need for very  strong, almost mystical leadership by  one woman in what was, after all, a com- I  munity of thousands of capable women.  And depending on your own inclination,  you will either love or hate the romantic  portrayal of monogamy: there are many  very happy long-term couples in this  book in contrast to the one character who  plays the field and comes across as a  predator.  Still, it was fun to read, and I don't  hesitate to recommend it.  Tesseracts  is a new anthology of Canadian  science fiction, edited by Judith Merril.  It includes several stories by women, some  who've never been published before. It's  available at Ariel Books, 2766 West 4-th  Ave..

I must say, first of all, that I am  encouraged to see a feminist publication taking issue with the right of  lesbians to total sexual freedom.  It is often estimated that only 3-5  percent of children who are sexually  molested by adults are molested by a  female agressor. Interestingly enough,  . Kinsey also estimates the number of  self-professed lesbians to be between  3 and 5 percent. I greatly fear that  if the number of self-professed lesbians rose to 10 percent the number  of children sexually molested by women  would rise proportionally.  This is not to say that I believe that  all children sexually molested by  women are necessarily molested by lesbians. Rather, I think that the percentage of women who are able to be self-  professed lesbians in our society is  an indication of the extent to which  we as women have begun to understand  the parameters of our own sexuality.  In the past, women were not viewed  as being sexual by others, and did  not see themselves as being sexual  either. With our increasing freedom  to explore the possibilities of our  own sexuality comes the freedom to  use our sexuality in negative, destructive, and most of all, exploitive  ways. Only by recognizing that some  women do in fact use their sexuality  in exploitive ways can we, as individual women, consciously opt out of this  kind of behaviour.  It's time to stop telling politically  convenient lies about lesbianism, and  about gender differences in general.  To claim that to allow women to talk  about abusive situations that they  have been in with other women amounts  to fanning the fires of homophobia is  patent nonsense. However, forcing women  to go outside of the feminist community  in order to be able to talk about their  experiences, probably will have that  effect.  There can be no doubt that various types  of sexual abuse do exist between women.  And to hide that fact, either from ourselves, or from the outside world, isn't  wise. Let me explain:  On Dealing With the Offender:  Ann Cameron, in the June issue, suggests  confronting the alleged offender. But  given the size of the lesbian community,  and the emotional nature of the issue,  this vigilante style jsutice could well  result in the lynching of more than one  innocent lesbian.  I don't think it's desirable, or even  possible to deal with these problems  within the confines of the lesbian community. I don't even think that an adequate form of justice can be achieved  within the confines of the much larger  feminist community. The best solution  (imperfect though it may be) is to try  the alleged offender in as calm and  rational an atmosphere as possible.  She should be brought before the courts  just as any male offender would be.  Many lesbians will-take issue with me  on this point, saying that allowing  such cases to come before the courts  will create bad publicity for the lesbian community. Certainly there was some  bad publicity around last winter's lesbian child-support case, but on the  whole, I believe that this is still the  best solution. It is high time for lesbians to be fully integrated into the  community, and this has negative as  well as positive aspects.  On Dealing With the Survivor:  Once again, I don't think that real .  and adequate solutions can be found  within the confines of the lesbian,  and/or feminist communities. The survivor needs to be given as wide as  possible an array of options for healing  herself. What is important is that she  not be excluded  from our communities  for saying/trying to say something that  we would rather noj hear.  In conclusion, homosexism has long been  a problem in the feminist community,  and I am pleased and encouraged that it  is at last being discussed. I hope that  the future will continue to see this kind  of honest discussion of sexual issues.

I regret that.Karen got the  impression from my letter in May '86  Kinesis  that I was being disrespectful  to women working in transition houses  in B.C.. This certainly was not my  intent, and I am glad' that Karen responded to my letter.  In my saying, "many shelters choose to  take the per diem rather than close  their doors", I was- wanting to indicate  that this was the choice the government  gave women struggling to open and maintain shelters for battered women in  B.C.. I was wanting to indicate respect  for those women's choices to keep  shelters open and to be clear that the  bind of the per diem contract and the  inherent conditions is of the government's making. My intent was to credit  the women working in shelters who were  not willing for battered women to have  no shelters available at all.  I also regret the impression that I  left Karen with from my statement,  "women who are ineligible for welfare  are welcome at our shelter". I wasn't  referring to shelters that have per  diem contracts with MHR when I raised  this point. I was trying to anticipate  . and set straight a fairly common misconception about Rape Relief and Women's  Shelter. In the past, some women have  argued that since we ask women to pay  rent at our shelter then women who are  ineligible for welfare and who have no  waged work must be denied housing with  us. I was wanting to point out that  this is not the case and that those  women are welcome at our shelter, just  as they are at the other shelters in  B.C..  I appreciate Karen's correction of my  statements regarding what the government  is prepared to provide to a woman in  many houses in B.C. with per diem contracts. I stand corrected. However, my  point about cash and not vouchers in a  woman's hands is still valid. And I  urge MHR to respond positively to negotiations with the Society of Transition.  Houses.  In closing, I regret my phrasing that  led to Karen's impression that I was  "trashing the many women working in  transition houses in B.C." and I hope  that I have corrected that here. I  appreciate Karen's response, her corrections and the opportunity to respond myself.  Sincerely,  Bonnie Agnew for Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter  Atlantic feminists  under attack  We are calling for your active support  on an issue which may well affect all  feminist groups in Canada.  The Atlantic Region of the Canadian  Association of Sexual Assault Centres  (CASAC) organized, with the major  assistance of the Charlottetown Rape  Crisis Centre and Secretary of State,  a conference on women and violence.  The conference, open to all centres in  the Atlantic provinces who were working with women in crisis, was held in  PEI in August, 1985.  The conference followed a familiar  format for many centres: rounds, identification of the issues and problems,  analysis, identification of the vision,  and discussion of action necessary to  make the vision a reality.  For many centres, it was the first time  'that sexual assault was seen in a  broader context and the result was a  highly charged, emotional, exciting  and consciousness-raising weekend.  Among the issues addressed (and there  were many) was oppression, in all its  forms, and the need to educate ourselves about and support oppressed  people, particularly women.  We discussed lesbianism, and how  choices for women must include all  choices. We talked about now important  it is for all feminists' to create a  "safe" place for lesbians, because  there are so few safe places, especially  in small communities.  Women, many for the first time, felt  truly in a safe place. The conference  helped to focus our energy, and recharge our batteries, and it gave us  the support we needed to return to our  isolated settings and continue our anti-  rape work.  Unfortunately, the experience was not  positive for some. A group of women  from one centre left after rounds, the  first day, as they "did not see women's  issues as a priority."  One woman left toward the end of the  conference, leaving behind the two  women who had come with her.  This particular woman was involved in  problems in her local centre (Pictou  .County) after the conference. The re- .  suit was a brief, submitted to Secre-  'Ģ tary of State, denouncing the conference and her own centre.  It was felt, at that time, that there  was no point in responding to this  action, other than supporting individual women, as we were sure that  Secretary of State would not take  the accusations of one person seriously, when the evaluations from everyone else were so positive. It was also  felt that accusations such as "funding  feminism" would hardly be seen as negative, as that is within the mandate  of the Women's Programme. Kinesis July/August'86   33  LETTERS /BULLETIN BOARD  The problem, however, has escalated.  This particular woman, with the assistance of local right-wing support, has  participated in an active campaign to  discredit her local centre, centres in  the Atlantic provinces and, ultimately,  centres across Canada (mostly through  the organization known as Realistic,  Equal, Active for Life (REAL) Women.)  One of their ways of doing this has been  a telephone and mail campaign to Secretary of State and Brian Mulroney, complaining about funding "radical lesbian  feminist centres." Pictou County was  identified as one such centre.  Another tactic has been to discredit the  local centre, and its members in the  community, through the media and local  ' churches.  We are very concerned, in the Atlantic  region, about the effect that this might  have on feminist organizations in this  country, particularly on the majority of  those centres who are struggling in isolation to live their feminist principles,  often in an anti-woman, homophobic environment .  We need to put forward to everyone, including the government, that, yes, we  do see this society as lacking when it  comes to the treatment of women; yes,  we support women having"choices in their•  lives; yes, we will create a safe place  for them to do' that; and yes, we have  the right to ask for government money to  continue our work.  We have reason to believe that the Prime  Minister's office has been "flooded" with  telephone calls from right-wing groups,  protesting the funding of the Pictou  County Women's Centre, and of the Atlantic conference.  The Pictou County Women's Centre's funding may be in jeopardy, and whether the  government will ever fund another Atlantic conference is hard to say.  Feminists in the Atlantic region need your  support.
