 KIJWMJ  news about women that's not in the dailies  >t\t  *\  \g*v lerZalm won't debate  Premier Bill Vander Zalm has  refused to participate in a  Forum on women's Issues sponsored by a number of groups  including: Women's Economic  Agenda, First United Church of  Canada (BC), Professional  Native Women's Association,  BC Federation of Labour and the  Vancouver Status of Women.  The other party leaders Bob  Skelly, Art Lee and Jim McNeil  have accepted invitations to  the Forum tentatively scheduled  for October 16 at Vancouver's  Robson Square Media Centre.  The Forum is an opportunity for  women to hear the leaders express their platform on women's  issues prior to the vote. A  delegation from the Forum Planning Committee met last Friday  with Hope Witherspoon, President of BC Social Credit Party,  to extend, once again, an  invitation to Premier Vander  Zalm to attend the Forum.  Witherspoon offered this explanation for the Premier's  refusal to debate: "When we're  the party in power we don't  have to get involved in public  debates. We are reluctant to  participate because it gives  the other parties a platform."  Dorrie Nagler, spokesperson  for the Forum Planning Committee  said, "The Socred's are short  circuiting the democratic process by putting on a marketing  campaign. Women face substantial social and economic  disadvantages and need to know  what our politicians intend to  do about this situation. Women  cannot be sure Vander Zalm is  concerned about these hardships  if he is unwilling to face us  publically."  During the Forum on women's »  issues a representative panel g  of women will question the §  leaders about their party's =  policy on poverty, equal pay <  for work of equal value, child- -°  care, and violence against J  women and children.  Since becoming Premier, Vander  Zalm committed himself to running an "open and accessible  government." However in the  electoral campaign he avoids  public debate.  "This is an unacceptable and  inappropriate way of dealing  the concerns of over half the  voting population," said Nagler.  While his aids in Victoria  claimed the Premier prefers to  meet only with women privately  to discuss their issues Vander  Zalm has refused a meeting  with BC Daycare Action Coalition.  In the midst of media's hype  about style versus substance  in the election campaign, women's issues are not receiving  much attention.  To date, the New Democratic  Party has gone on record with  three major pledges which could  have a strong impact on women.

Taking back the night  walk in freedom  by Marrianne van Loon  Accompanied by three hundred  women, giant puppets reclaimed  the streets of Vancouver for the  night of Friday Sept. 19.  This celebration and affirmation began at the Art Gallery  downtown where women from Vancouver Rape Relief (VRR), who  sponsored the event, read telegrams of support from women's  groups across the country.  Nicole Kennedy of VRR spoke  about the importance of fighting back against violence done  to women, and refusing to  accept this intolerable situation .  "Tonight we are gathering once  again, to say it must stop.  We are taking the freedom to  Federal fertility hearings a sham  Depo-Provera, a controversial  contraceptive drug currently  under consideration for approval by the federal Conservatives,  has not received the thorough  Investigation promised by federal Health Minister Jake Epp  last December.  According to the Vancouver  Women's Health Collective,  a founding member of the Canadian Coalition on Depo-Provera,  the six invitation-only closed  meetings recently held across  Canada on fertility control  issues did not adequately assess either the general birth  control needs of Canadians or  the safety of Depo-Provera specifically.  "Our fear," said Coalition representative Lorna Zaback, "is  that the government has already  decided to approve Depo-Provera  and that these meetings were a.  way of placating opposition to  the drug."  Depo-Provera is the trade name  for the injectable form of  medroxpyrogesterone acetate, a  synthetic progesterone-like  hormone. It prevents both ovulation and menstrual bleeding  by disrupting a woman's normal  hormone pattern. Depending on  the dosage, a single shot will  prevent pregnancy for three  to eight months.  Although it is currently used  in over eighty countries and has  been given to approximately ten  million women for birth control  purposes, the drug is the subject of world-wide controversy  and is currently under investigation by the World Health  Organization. Manufactured by  the U.S. based Upjohn Company,  approval of the drug for contraceptive purposes in the United  States has been turned down  three times.  Side effects noted by the Coalition include weight loss or gain  depression, dizziness, loss of  hair, limb pain, abdominal discomfort, vaginal discharge,  darkening spots of the facial  skin as well as problems which  have been linked to long term  use including cancer of the  uterus, breast cancer, drastically increased incidence of  diabetes, severe mental depression and temporary or permanent  infertility.  Coalition members represented  at the Vancouver Fertility Control Meeting included the Vancouver Women's Health Collective, the Vancouver Status of  Women, and British Columbians  for the Mentally Handicapped,  all of whom impressed upon the  government appointed panel that  Depo-Provera should not be  approved for contraceptive use  at this time. Approximately  twenty-five individuals and  organizations attended the  invitiation-only meeting September 11, including pharmacists,  birth control counsellors,  health clinics, endocrinologists (doctors specializing in  the gladular/hormonal system)  and Coalition representatives.  The coalition will continue  its efforts to stop Depo-Provera 's approval. Because of  its injectible mode of delivery, which requires almost no  'co-operation from the woman  using it, the Coalition is  concerned women will not be  adequately informed about the  drug before getting an injection.  "We are gravely concerned that  Depo-Provera might be approved  on the basis of findings at  these closed hearings," says  the Coalition. "Once Depo is  approved, we can expect it to  be widely advertised and promoted by the manufacturer."  The Coalition points to the  difficulty in removing drugs  from the market once they  have been approved and warns  that Canada "does not need  another DES, another sequential  -oral contraceptive, another  Dalkon Shield.". .  walk in the street at night  without being raped or the fear  of rape."  This year the march circled the  Granville/Davie area of downtown, where many women work in  the sex trade. Kennedy emphasized the degree of violence  which prostitutes face. "Prostitutes sire raped an average of  ten times per year. So far  seven women have been murdered  this year. Prostitutes are  criminalized, marginalized as  outlaws and more vulnerable to  brutality from the men who buy  them and the police as a result.'  And, Kennedy also stressed that  poor women, lesbians, older  women, disabled and young women  and women of colour are frequent targets of sexual violence  on the street. "All of us are  potential rape victims," she  said "because of our sex. When  we talk about street rape however, there are additional  factors which increase our vulnerability: poverty, race, age,  physical ability, sexual orientation ."  Organizers outlined safety  precautions. As in earlier years,  the organizers decided not to  apply for a permit from city  hall, on the grounds that women  do not need to ask permission  to take our freedom. At this  year's march police were notable  by their absence; unlike other  years there were only a few  uniformed men visible.

Typesetting and camera work by  Elections from page 1  Bob Skelly, the NDP leader, has promised  that he will introduce equal pay for work  of equal value legislation for both public and private sector workers, if elected. 'While in many business quarters pay  equity is seen as a radical demand, other  provinces, notably Ontario and Manitoba,  are moving quickly to -implement equal pay  measures.  Skelly has also announced that an NDP government would introduce job security legislation similar to job protection laws in  other countries. Such legislation would  be beneficial to women workers as they  bear the brunt of job losses through technological change, privatization and  deregulation.  Increases in the minimum wage, another  NDP promise, would also be a boon to  women who constitute a majority of workers  in service industries, the sector of the  labour force that' invariably sets wage  rates at the minimum wage level.  Pledges or promises from the Social Credit  Party on issues of concern to women are, ■  to date, non-existant. Instead, in two  areas, we are faced with Bill Vander  Zalm's threatening speculations.  Vander Zalm has promised that he, personally, will review the operations of  therapeutic abortion boards in B.C. to  insure that they are not being "misused".  Given Vander Zalm's Roman Catholic beliefs  Kinesis notes *****  This is it, folks. You may want to hold  onto this copy of Kinesis, because it's  the last of its kind.  What?'.?! No, wait a minute, before you  panic. We're not going to change our  commitment to feminism and women's struggles, thinking, and creativity. But we're  going to look  real different.  You will have noticed some hints of the new  Kinesis  creeping through in this issue and  the last one. Next issue, after months of  work by the design committee and the computer committee and the fundraising committee, we'll be laser'printed (feminism goes  ■Star Wars) instead of typewritten. This  will let us say the same amount in a shorter  paper! And it will be more readable, too.  With a few more alterations, overall we'll  be looking zippier, clearer and thoroughly  modern.  We want you, our readers and supporters, to  inaugurate the new Kinesis  with us. First,  you're invited to our launching (just like  a real magazine, eh?) to help us celebrate.  See the back for details.  Second (and this is the real fun part) we  want new women to get involved now, on the  ground floor of this new production process.  No experience necessary, and what better  way to meet terrific feminists, learn about:  newspapers, and be right at the heart of  what's happening for women in B.C.? Talk to  one of us at the launching, or call the  office at 873-5925.  Finally, get ready to enjoy, as the magazine  we fondly think of as offering the best in  feminist journalism gets even better!  such a personal review does not bode well  for women's access to abortion in this  province.  Another area for concern is Vander Zalm's  much touted review of the minimum wage  laws. His suggestion, that such protection may not be necessary and may limit  job creation, is direct from B.C.'s Fraser  Institute, a right wing think tank responsible for the ideological under-pinnings  of the Socred 1983 restraint program.  Minimum wage rate legislation is one of  the very few protections that unorganized  workers, a majority of whom are women,  have.  Bill Vander Zalm has been silent on what  his government will do to improve the  status of women in B.C.  Given that previous Socred restraint policies are a, if not the, cause for the  drop in women's standard of living in B.C.  This neglect of women's priorities, while  predictable, Is scandalous.  Vander Zalm's refusal to participate in a  debate on women's issues speaks volumes  about his recognition of the importance  of women's votes to his campaign.

Student task force seeks submissions  Over the past three years the  student assistance program in  British Columbia has undergone  a number of important changes.  In 1984 the provincial government eliminated the grant portion of student assistance and  replaced it with a loan.  British Columbia remains the  only province in Canada without a grant portion of student  assistance. Between 1983 and  1986 provincial funding for  student aid decreased from $33  million to $12 million. As  well, our provincial government  has moved in the direction of  an achievement-based rather  than a needs-based assistance  program.  These changes have resulted in  a vicious circle' for students.  Student debt loads have risen  dramatically and yet federal  and provincial living allowances don't meet students'  real costs of living. Unemployment rates for students and  youth remain high, therefore  students are increasingly hesitant to take on debts that  they may not be able to pay  back.  An inadequate student assistance program means that fewer people have access to post-  secondary education. Those most  affected are students from  rural areas and low-income fam  ilies . The Canadian Federation  of Students (CFS) believes  that the situation is critical  and is concerned about the  lack of action on the part of  the provincial government.  CFS believes it Is time to  evaluate the BC Student Assistance Program, and to this end  has organized a forum for discussion and information-gathering.  In conjunction with the Defend  Education Services Coalition  CFS will be holding a series  of hearings on, student assistance at college and university  campuses around the province.  The Task Force is an excellent  opportunity to make some constructive changes to our student assistance program and  to work with other organizations and people who are concerned about education in BC. .  Interested individuals or organizations are invited to  make a presentation—oral or  written—to the Student Assist  ance Task Force at the campus  nearest you.  The schedule of hearings is as  follows:  Oct. 6, Selkirk College (Castle-  gar); Oct. 9, College of New  Caledonia; Oct. 14-, Okanagan  College; Oct. 16, Douglas  College; Oct. 21, University  of Victoria.

Women only sauna at Britannia threatened  by Linda Field  The Britannia Community Centre pool is slated for renovation at an unknown date, sometime within the near future.  Vancouver City Council has  approved funds for this project. The architect has plans  including a childrens' pool,  and change rooms for families  and the disabled.  At issue here for women is the  sauna. The renovation plans  include removal of the separate sex, women and men only  saunas; to be replaced by a  co-ed sauna. According to the  planners, there is not enough  room for every new feature  and  the retention of the original saunas.  Britannia wants to modernizi  and upgrade their pool facility. The current saunas' are  small and plain. Family change  rooms are very popular at the  Maple Ridge Community Centre.  Britannia planners want Brit  to be the first community centre in Vancouver to have this  feature. Change rooms for the  disabled would be new, although  all community centre change  rooms are (supposed to be)  accessible now.  Britannia Centre is the only  community centre that has a  year-round pool with a woman  only sauna. Mount Pleasant has  a very small womens' sauna  that is intended for use by  racket ball players. There is  no year-round pool there.  People who want a co-ed sauna  have many choices, including  Templeton Centre which is less  than one km. from Britannia.  Women who want a woman-only  sauna have Brit—until?  This plan is still open to  change if there is enough community feedback. The pool renovation committee has worked  hard on this project, and has  asked the community surrounding  Britannia to respond.  If you want the women's sauna  retained, please write soon.  Letters will have an effect  and are important, especially  if many are sent.

Last year we  had a wonderful birthday celebration with her. She was in  remission, and full of energy for Molly, her five year old  daughter, and for the life she loved—hiking, swimming,  political work, capuccino with friends. . .  When I met Heather we were both at the Health Collective. She was marvellous to work with—totally absorbed  in what we were doing and fiercely determined to push  our practice to the ideals we had set. The Health Collective  had taken a few weeks out to examine our goals. Heather  was excited that we were re-establishing the political base  for our work and had pressed hard for us to do even  though it meant suspending service for a time.  Heather looked for consensus, but she was not afraid to  say what she thought when it was different from the rest of  the group. I think of her at all these meetings, intense in  her attention to what everyone was saying, making notes  in the large black book she always had with her. One task  she took on was to research the history of lay health care  givers and, ultimately, her report took the form of a  dramatic presentation. I remember being moved to tears  as she spoke the words of women who had been burned  alive for sharing the secrets of birth control with their  sisters and daughters.  The same commitment to choice and control of our  bodies was the basis for Heather in her decision to become  a mother and to have control in her birthing process. On  the day her waters broke she and Tony, Molly's father,  drove five hours over California mountains to get to a  birth centre that would support Heather giving birth in the  way she wanted. At this point, wonderful Molly became  Heather's most important focus and she dropped back  from other work for some time.  Then video production sparked Heather's interest. She  took classes in video and joined with other women to form  Speak Out Productions where she became a key force in  their first production: Fight Back: Vancouver Transition  House. The video has been used widely in organizing  toward the survival of Vancouver Transition House and it  has also received a Canadian Cable Televison Association  Award. At the time of her diagnosis, Heather was in the  midst of a second production meant to capture the struggles,  passions and joys of motherhood and in this way create a  real picture of what being a mother means for women.  Working on her own this time, Heather interviewed on  Jilm several women including herself on how becoming a  mother had changed their lives.  When she learned she had leukemia, in its most virulent  form, Heather applied the same inspiration and intensity  to fight her illness. With the help of a large and willing  support group, she organized research into the disease,  evaluating conventional medical and alternative treatments.  As usual, she demanded the most from herself. Her intention was to defeat the leukemia by taking what she needed  from every useful source. There were times when it was  very hard for her not to lose herself in the process of  treatment, but she always surfaced, and kept talking with  us, writing in her black notebook, making plans for the  next day, being Heather. This warm and wonderful  woman, loved by so many of us, had remarkable strength.  She touched us unforgettably.  October ^6 Kinesis        —   _^_ Across B.C.

The space currently offers a  lending library, recreational  Charter case  Equality is not equality, when  a court is comparing a thirty  seven year old man with the  fourteen year old boy he  claims agreed to an act of  sexual intercourse. This is  the ruling of the B.C. Court  of Appeal, B.C.'s highest court,  when the province appealed the  acquittal on sexual assault  charges of Victoria school  teacher, David Le Gallant.  In the original trial Le Gallant's lawyer successfully  argued that the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms says age  discrimination is unacceptable  and that Le Gallant should  therefore be acquitted.  In overturning the acquittal  the Court of Appeal found that  the Criminal Code provision  recognizes consentual sexual  activity between adolescents  who are close in age is one  thing but that the school  teacher and the child he raped  are not in the same class because it can be assumed that  Le Gallant, as an adult, is  more experienced.  The ruling indicates that the  Charter's equality provisions  will not have blanket coverage  vis a vis age discrimination  in B.C.. Age discrimination,  under Section 15 of the Charter,  will arise only if an unreasonable or unjustifiable distinction is drawn between citizens.  The Court said the distinction  in consent provisions with regard to sexual assault reflects  parliament's intention to distinguish between sexual exploitation by adults of children,  and consentual activity between  adolescents.  As a result of the provinces'  successful appeal Le Gallant  will have to undergo a new  trial.   4      Kinesis October ^6  area—with a pool table, information displays, pamphlets, art  exhibits, in addition to the  structured peer counselling/  support groups.  On Friday, September 5, over  150 women passed through the  VLC; a great turn-out for a  balmy summer night. Those who  joined in the festivities  weren't disappointed. After  co-ordinator Bet Cecill's  opening address, which capsul-  ized the Centre's accomplishments, popular folksinger Donna  Lee took to the stage for. a  short but enthralling set.  Acting Up Theatre kept the  crowd entertained with two  scenes from Pat Smith's posthumously published play The  Oldest Living.  Set in rural  Saskatchewan, the play centres  around a lesbian couple who  has been living together for  over thirty years; a warm and  funny play, which we hope to  present in its entirety soon.  Athough it was a woman-only  event, many members of the gay  male community were also thanked  for the energy they had applied  in the past year.  The evening brought together a  variety of women from all different backgrounds. Perhaps  that's the key to the Centre's  success—it provides a warm,  friendly environment for women  to join, in our community.

Happy first birthday to the Vancouver Lesbian Centre!  Trees for Africa program  The need for reforestation has  become a major issue in British  Columbia recently, but, if a  program sponsored by the United  Nations Association (UNA) is  to be successful, the issue  will soon take on a whole new  sense of urgency.  Reforestation is vital in BC,  but in vast regions of Africa  it is even more important. Prolonged drought and a combination of other factors are  causing unprecedented deforestation which in turn results  in catastrophic economic and  social hardships. The desertification of large areas that  were previously forested has  contributed to famine, home-  lessness and economic collapse  in countries affected.  From October 16th to 19th, the  UNA will be hosting a "Trees  for Africa" conference in  Vancouver to draw together  British Columbians from various  Socreds refuse funding for AIDS  On the eve of an election campaign the Social Credit government denied AIDS Vancouver the'  funding it needs to keep educational and support programs going.  "We just cannot believe", said  AIDS Vancouver spokesperson,  Bob Tivey, "that they cannot  find the money."  Funding was to be used to pay  the salaries of three people  who coordinate the AIDS hotline,  support groups for victims,  families and friends and the  volunteer network.  AIDS Vancouver, which has never  received provincial funding,  had requested an $80,000 grant  from the provincial ministry of  health. Currently the group  receives grants from both the  federal and municipal governments  which total $125,000.  "We are in a desperate situation, " said Tivey. "The ministry has 32,000 people on its  payroll." "We just can't believe  they can't find enough money to  support three more...it's outrageous ."  Dr. Michael Rekart, the man responsible for the government's  AIDS program, said the rejection  of the grant is not a sign the  government does not support the  group.  "The ministry recognizes that  AIDS Vancouver is doing a .  great job and have helped us  out a lot," said Rebark. "We  just don't have the money right  Deaths from AIDS continue to  mount in Vancouver. The most  recent figures show that there  has been 167 AIDS cases in the  city; 88  are still alive.  According to Rekart, September  saw the first sexually contracted AIDS death of a heterosexual  woman in BC. The woman acquired  the disease from a bisexual  man. Although no details about  the woman have been released  Rekart confirmed that the woman  was not a prostitute. Her death,  he says, indicates that bisexual men, afraid of getting AIDS  from homosexual contact, will  gravitate to the 'safe' female  population.  sectors of the community with  the aim of developing an aid  program that will tackle the  problem of deforestation in  the Sahel region of Africa.  According to conference organizer Jon Gates, the participation of women in both the  conference and the Aid program  is crucial.  "Women in Africa do between 60  to 80 per cent of all agricultural work, in addition to the  time they spend on domestic  work. The failure of government  and non-government agencies  to recognize this fact when  planning aid programs has  worsened an already difficult  problem. Many of the successful village level programs in  forestry and agroforestry have  been initiated and run by women  We hope to increase the success  of our program by recognizing  from the start, womens' crucial  role in development."  Rather than continually supplying food aid, the aim of "Trees  for Africa", is to work with  the people in the Sahel who  are already trying to combat  the deforestation problem.  "What could be more appropriate  as a project for British Columbians than one that focuses on  reforestation," Gates says. He  adds that the situation is far  from hopeless and that progress  has already been made. "They  have been accomplishing miracles  already," he says. "It's just  that they don't have the resour^  ces to do the job that has to  be done."  The Sahel, an Arab word meaning 'edge of the desert' is a  string of eight countries along  the southern fringes of the  Sahara desert. It has been in  drought for the past fifteen  years. In 1983 alone, the desert advanced at least 150  kilometers southwards, causing  the loss of 4-12.5 million hectares of crop and range lands.

ACROSS B.C.  //////////////////////A  Women left behind by BCGEU settlement  by Catherine Sullivan  Headlines and television pictures told an  unsuspecting public on Wednesday, August  20, that negotiators for the government  and the British Columbia Government Employees Union (BCGEU) reached a historic  agreement. There was footage of negotiators  hugging and 'embracing.  As a female government employee and concerned BCGEU member, I was anxious to  know the contract details, and was still  naively optimistic that we had not been  sold out—again.  Seeing the details, I experienced profound  disbelief and betrayal. BCGEU president  John Shields proclaimed a victory of "no  concessions", yet I soon discovered that  Shields had capitulated on major concessions, and the trumpeted five percent wage  increase is not a reality for government  workers until November 1987.  Also, the union compromised female government workers with an across the board increase which creates real gains only for  those workers at the upper end of the pay  scale...deja vul  The salaries and positions of BC government workers have changed appreciably over  the past ten years. In 1976, our civil servants were the highest paid government  workers in Canada. Ten years later, they  are the-second lowest. Only Newfoundland  pays its public employees less, and they  are still fighting a bitter confrontation  ithat has dragged on for months.  Many Newfoundland employees and several  union leaders were jailed in the spring,  and again last month as they continue to  picket in defiance of government and court  orders to cease and desist.  These same 'heroic' women are  now scapegoated and sacrificed,  and gain the least in the current  agreement.  In the past few years, the BC Socreds have  done their utmost to reduce union power  and break any attempt at an organized labour front. The BC economic recession and  the government response in the form of  restraint rationalizes and legitimizes  the dismantling of the social service  system and the call for greater productivity.  The government capitalizes on a public  image of workers as "people who sit around  on her/his ass all day doing nothing" and  generated support for their program to  put those workers "to work". Aside from  those who were directly affected by government service cutbacks, the public remains largely unaware of the true impact  of these cuts in human costs.  When community and welfare rights groups  protested, the Socreds suggested that the  protest was actually being waged by lazy  public servants and welfare bums who didn't  want to work in the first place.  By manipulating that negative image of  government workers, with media assistance  in stories like the 1985 Province  headlines  detailing the grisly incidences of "bad"  social work practi'ce, the public has been  distracted from examining the issues and  the reality of workers' lives.  The BCGEU is comprised of 4-0,000 :  Over half that number are women, mainly  concentrated in low-paying, clerical jobs.  Many are single parent women supporting  families on salaries that qualify them for  extended welfare benefits (medical, daycare ).  In the goverment and union hierarchy, women  are noticeably absent from any position of  power. The government employee and the union  structures are yet another microcosm of  women's position in society generally.  In the Ministry of Social Services (et al),  there are no women beyond the position of  'regional manager', in effect no women  deciding actual policy and procedures. It  is ironic that the majority on welfare and  most front line workers are women, but men  make the decisions affecting these women's  lives both at home and in the workplace.  The BCGEU does not have a better track  record in that department. They rarely  identify the needs of female members, and  in the few instances where they have acknowledged that women have needs quite distinct from men, these issues are conveniently manipulated to serve the union leadership 's interests yet noticeably absent when  the opportunity for real change arises, like  the last contract.  This July, BCGEU workers walked off targeted worksites for the first day of a bona-  fide provincial strike. As Shields explained, the union intended to take a creative  . approach during negotiations. The picketing workers were mainly clerical staff,  almost all women, and are the lowest  paid employees in the union. The union intended to pay them seventy percent of their  gross income.  Shields called them "the heroes" of the   *  negotiations. Not only were they to be  pulled off the job and still get seventy  percent of the.pay, but they would also  attend union dducation sessions where they  would learn about the history of the labour  movement and the BCGEU...but nothing happened!  Bennett threatened "back to work" legislation when these "heroes" did leave their  worksites, and Shields backed down, sending those workers back to their jobs. He  then announced that he preferred to wait  for a new social credit leader before  BCGEU resumed negotiations.  I think Shields fears confrontation  and radical action. He was afraid that he  might have to, stand behind his brave assertions and face" the possibility of going to  jail as did the Newfoundland labour leaders. -  These same "heroic" women are now scapegoated and sacrificed, and gain the least  in the current agreement. In the 1982 negotiations, the union asserted that the impact of increased food, shelter and energy costs hits middle and low income workers  the hardest; therefore the union chose to  negotiate the major portion of an increase  as a dollar amount for every member.  They said that "across the board" increases  have a differential impact. But, in 1986,  Shields negotiates an "across the board"  increase, ignoring what the BCGEU touted  in 1982. The actual dollar amount that  lowest paid workers get will be substan  tially less than what the workers at the  upper end get. And the five percent increase  doesn't take effect until next November  when the amount will have been gobbled up  by inflation. This deal maintains the  present inequities that ghettoize women  workers and keeps them doing traditional "  work for traditionally lousy wages.  In terms of the "no concession" agreement,  it was an outrageous surprise to discover  that the six days of sick time allowed per  year had been tossed into the negotiation  pot, and conceded to the other side. The  union had not asked its membership to detail which if any benefits were negotiable.  Does this mean that the BCGEU agrees with  a government that says its workers bleed  the system?  The contract provides for the establishment of an employees assistance program  where BCGEU members receive personal counselling and assistance with burn-out. It  is ironic that the negotiators did not  appreciate the need for universal sick  benefits, but instead provided counselling  in alcoholism, drug, and burn-out related  stress. The union sacrificed "coverage for  all" available through existing sick time  benefits, for a program that will benefit  only a few. The membership needs both universal coverage and specialized programs.  The union also agreed to government demands  freezing increments until 1987. Workers  entitled to these miniscule merit increases now have to wait for this acknowledgement of their job performance. Another  clause allows the- province to buy some  supplies from the lowest bidder eveisif  that bidder operates a non-union shop:  another example of union collusion with  government strategy?  It is obvious that the settlement was a  political football manipulated by both  the union and the government. I became  confused about the different players, and  which- side they were on. I shuddered when  I saw John Shields on television denying  that the Socreds had strategized to use  the BCGEU settlement as a tool to gain  election points for the new premier; how  did he know?  John Shields was quoted in newspapers as  crediting Bill Vander Zalm with the creation of a "confrontation-free" environment  for negotiations. It seems that Shields  is either very naive, unclear about his  loyalties, or he knew that the agreement  was so lousy, he didn't want to claim  credit for it.  f|||  October TO Kinesis     5 SSSSSmaS^  ACROSS B.C.  Provincial program may expand  by Alex Maas  The Family Support Program, MHR's new  maintenance enforcement service, is  currently up for review. The service aids  single mothers on welfare to obtain and  enforce child support payments. It was  set up as a two year pilot project, and  is jointly administered by the Minister  of Social Services and Housing (formerly  MHR) and the Attorney-General.  MSSH does the intake, assessment and  referral work, while the A-G handles the  legal aspect by providing lawyers to  obtain court orders for the women involved in the program. Payments are made to  a central court registry from which they  are distributed to the mothers. The  court registry monitors for default. If  default occurs, automatic enforcement  procedures are begun. The program marks  a new willingness to concern itself with  the problem of fathers who .abandon their  responsibility of financial support for  their children.  The two year project concludes in March  at the end of the fiscal year and a recommendation has already been made to the  Treasury Board for the continuation and  expansion of the project. A decision on  this will be made in March pending the  results of the current review. Presently  this series is only available to welfare  recipients, primarily women, in the City  of Vancouver. If the pilot is judged a  success, the program could become operable  throughout the province and be made available to the public at large.  Outsidte consultants have been retained to  conduct an evaluation which is scheduled  for completion at the end of the pilot  project. Project administrators involved  in the review process were not able to -  say if the report would be released to the  public, but did acknowledge that a major  factor under consideration has been the  financial viability of the program. Financial evaluations usually take the form of  a cost-benefit analysis.  The question here is benefit to whom?  Economic viability where this program is  concerned is measured in terms of "welfare dollars saved", ie. monies collected  through the court registry that exceed  the allowable maxiumum of the extra  earnings exemption. This exemption limits  the amount of income welfare recipients  are allowed to keep in addition to their  welfare cheque and is presently set at  $100. per month. Support monies paid into  the court registry on behalf of a single  mother which are in excess of the exemption are retained by the state and used  to reimburse/reduce the welfare budget.  This reimbursement has always been the  case, however, with the new central registry system and a state initiated approach to collection, more and larger  court orders have resulted in a corresponding increase in "welfare dollars  saved".  Neither the Ministry of the Attorney-  General nor the 'new' Social Services  Ministry was prepared to release any  figures on monies "saved" versus monies  spent on legal and collection costs at  this stage in their evaluation. While  these figures are not available in British  Columbia, the New Democratic government of  Manitoba which sponsors a similar program,  has estimated that it saved as much as  eleven million dollars in 1984.  6      Kinesis October TO  south of the'border, in the U.S., almost  all states have initiated such programs  and here they are proving to be very cost  effective. State governments recover about  three dollars for every dollar spent on  collection.  The danger with this kind of cost-benefit  analysis for the social services is that it  has become a justification for the erosion  of the rights of the individual welfare recipient in favour of the "greater" benefit  of a smaller social service budget. Specifically, in parts of the United States single mothers applying for welfare must  assign their right to receive support payments to the state before they are considered eligible for income assistance. A  lawyer is then given the case and, after  interviewing the woman, attempts to obtain  a court order for support payments.  The lawyers working in the program are  thought, as a matter of law, to represent  the state agency and not the welfare  mother or children. If the lawyer is suc-  | cessful the payments go directly to the  state agency where monies are reallocated  by the welfare department to the mother.  As is the case here, there are maximum  amounts that a mother may receive over the  monthly amount of the cheque and where an  order is in excess of this amount the balance is simply retained by the welfare department^   The question of who the money really belongs to is clearer in the American case  because of the assignment of rights. In  B.C. there is no such recipient as yet,  nevertheless there have been cases (in  Vancouver) of women who were found ineligible for income assistance because they  refused to pursue their former spouse for  support. Regulation 3(9) of the GAIN Act  requires a single mother to make "reasonable efforts" to seek out every source of  income available to her. A program intake  worker has the responsibility to decide  whether a valid reason for refusing to proceed exists. It is not sufficient for a  woman to decide against pursuit even if she  fears domestic violence unless she can substitute her claims through a third party.  Assignment of rights is an integral component of any state-run enforcement program  (and as such can not be far behind in B.C.)  since without it the legality of retaining  any portion of support payments seems tenuous. It is part of the philosophy towards  social services which says that welfare  programs, unlike defense programs, should  pay for themselves or at least not cost  the taxpayer unduly.  A further result of the American model has  been the erosion of a client-solicitor relationship and the bond of confidentiality  that relationship implies between the lawyer assigned the case and the mother applying for welfare. In at least one documented  case, a woman has implicated herself (by  Indicating that she had received overpayments) believing that the information would  remain confidential, only to find her lawyer later testifying against her in a case  of welfare fraud.  If the Vancouver project is judged successful it seems likely that we will see further changes to the program in keeping with  a consistent philosophy and a logical progression toward the American model. It will  be important to watch closely for the recommendations resulting'from the ministry's  internal review, and any conditions attached to the Treasury Board decision. We must  resist a further erosion of rights or  stricter controls over the lives of single  mothers on welfare.  Night from page 1  Then, towering above the women, the colourful puppets led off the march to the  Granville/Davie downtown area where many  women work as hookers and exotic dancers.  Traffic was disrupted, but mostly drivers  and passers-by were interested and many  were openly supportive.  One woman peeked through the double doors  of a strip joint and smiled at the marchers until women jeering at the explicit  signs on the building made her quietly  withdraw behind the closed door.  The occasional bad tempered, and invariably male driver or pedestrian, was deftly  handled by the safety team, and the  night was safe.  Although one first time marcher expressed  disappointment that there weren't more  women, she did say "I found it empowering..  While I was marching a woman who had seen  us going by joined in. She was really  excited that the whole thing was happening."  Halfway through the march, in the heart  of hooker territory, women stopped while  Marie Arrington of Prostitutes and Other  Women for Equal Rights (POWER), spoke  about the need to make the night safe for  all women.  "Until prostitutes are given their freedom  you're all under the gun," she said. "No  woman is safe." All women who break away  from the norm are at risk.  "You too can  be outlawed if you don't behave and be  good little girls." 'Ģ  "The first violence towards prostitutes is  poverty. The next is the men in your life;  the tricks who are your fathers, husbands,  sons, and all men in society."  Arrington also spoke about the violence of  the new anti-prostitute legislation, C-49.  Donna Kiss was murdered when she was  forced by the law to leave her familiar  workplace and went to work in Surrey, isolated and unprotected.  The law enforcers, the police, are also  directly responsible for violence against  prostitutes. Arrington described the good  face which the police show the media. "But  just let any woman speak up," she added. Lesbian organizing in Vancouver  In the past year Vancouver has seen an increase in lesbian political organizing, including the opening of the Vancouver Lesbian Centre. In January, the Lesbian Feminist Gang put on a workshop entitled: Lesbian Visibility/Invisibility in the Feminist  Movement.  Over thirty lesbians participated in this  discussion, where the feeling most commonly expressed was that of feeling invisible  as a lesbian in mixed (lesbian and heterosexual ) groups.  From this meeting came possible strategies  to ensure that lesbian politics are heard.  One strategy suggested by Dykes for Dyke-  dom was to work as lesbians in coalition,  with a long term vision of expanding, to  network on a national and international  level.  Dykes for Dykedom sent out letters to local  lesbian groups in February. The Vancouver  Lesbian Network was formed and began  meeting at the Vancouver Lesbian Centre.  Representatives from some local lesbian  groups, and individuals not associated with  . formal groups, attended the initial meetings where topics of discussion ranged  from what makes an issue a lesbian issue,  to the International Lesbian Conference  (March) and International Lesbian Week  (October).  Towards the end of March two dykes from  the Vancouver community attended the eighth  International Lesbian Conference in Geneva,  Switzerland. There, approximately 400 lesbians gathered to "consolidate that which  unites us (resistance to patriarchy) and to  discuss that which divides us: racism,  classism, ageism, and other discriminatory  'isms'.  Information regarding the conference is  available in the form of a slide show  which is framed in the context of classism  and racism. It has been shown at the Vancouver Lesbian Centre and the Simon Fraser  University Women's Centre and will be shown  again on Tues.. Oct. 7 during International  Lesbian Week.  For the past two months the focus of the  newly formed Lesbian Network has been to  organize and co-ordinate International  ■Lesbian Week in Vancouver. This international event originated in Europe in 1979  when a group of lesbians broke away from  the International Gay Association to form  International Lesbian Information Service  (ILIS).  ILIS, frustrated at the lack of political  action (specifically lesbian political  action) in the International Gay Association, organized International Lesbian Week  as a forum for lesbian action.  The lesbian movement in Vancouver is growing. There are twelve groups at present,  and we are continuing to work on visibility  inside and outside the feminist movement.  with Jessi.

Lesbian Week  For the first time in Vancouver, lesbians  are organizing a series of events to take  place during International Lesbian Week.  We are linking up with lesbians in Austria,  France, Holland, and Quebec, who since  1983 have organized events to celebrate  International Lesbian Week during the first  week of October. In Canada events are  planned for Vancouver and Ottawa.  International Lesbian Week has been organized this year by the Lesbian Network.  We are individuals and representatives from  lesbian groups in Vancouver who have been  meeting since February 86 to discuss politics, exchange information, and to plan  particular actions.

They'll be broadcasting special shows, polishing up regular programming, and asking everyone who's listening  to call in and pledge to become a member.  The highlight of this year's Airlift will  be "Breaking the Sound Barrier," three  days of 24 hour special music programming,  Oct. 24-26. There'll be a five hour special on music by women, covering jazz,  blues, pop, African and Latin American  music. There'll be a live appearance by  local country singer Terilyn Ryan. And  there'll be the music of Motown, the Carri-  bean, modern rock and live jazz.  From Oct. 17 to noon Oct. 24, you'll hear  the best of our regular programming, including Womanvision (Mondays at 7 pm),  the Lesbian Show (Thursdays at 8:30 pm),  Women of Note (Mondays at 4:00 pm) and  Rubymusic (Fridays at 7:30 pm).  What makes Co-op Radio different? It's  deeper than just what you hear on your  radio. The station is a co-operative.  It's owned and operated by listeners who  have become members. When you join, you  have a say in how the station is run, and  in what goes over the air. You can even  work on a show yourself.  Why should you join? Co-op Radio is the  only station in Vancouver that's actively  anti-sexist and anti-racist, and allows  women the space to do programming by and  for themselves.  If you are a regular listener who isn't  yet a member, Co-op Radio hopes you'll  call in and pledge to become one during  the Airlift. If you aren't yet a regular  listener, tune in and check it out.  Co-op Radio is broadcast at 102.7 FM,  104-.9 on cable in the Lower Mainland, and  other frequencies around the province. For  information on regular or Airlift programming, call the station at 684-84-94 and ask  to be mailed a complimentary copy of the  October issue of Radio Waves, our program  guide magazine.

October TO Kinesis ///////////////////////^^^^^  /////////////////////////^^^^^  Across Canada  Abortion  struggles  heat up  across  Canada  by Noreen Howes  Abortion has recently been front page news  across the country, culminating in the arrest of Dr. Henry Morgentaler and two  associates in Toronto late September.  Arrested at their homes early in the day,  before operations at either the Scott or  the Morgentaler Clinic could begin, Morgentaler along with Dr. Robert Scott and Dr.  Nikki Colodny were each charged with two  counts of conspiracy to procure a miscarriage—the Criminal Code term for abortion.  A stay of proceedings on these charges was  imposed by Ontario Attorney General Ian  Scott almost immediately, and means that  the Crown can pursue the charges for up to  one year although Scott says no action will  be taken before the Supreme Court rules on  previous abortion-related charges. This  Supreme Court hearing slated for Oct. 8  could rule that abortions in free-standing  clinics become legal across Canada and  that the Ontario acquittal of Morgentaler,  Scott and Smalling be upheld.  During the past twelve months several significant developments in the battle for  abortion clinics in Toronto have surfaced,  some more positive than others.  A third doctor, Nikki Colodny, began working with Morgentaler and publicly supported the clinic. Having a woman doctor preforming abortions lent even greater support both to the movement and to the individual women seeking the clinic's services . Colodny began working in January  and was arrested only last week. A second  Toronto clinic was opened in May by Dr.  Robert Scott and remains in operation five  days a week.  Both the Morgentaler and the Scott clinic  remained open during the. Ontario doctors  strike and the subsequent dismantling of  many hospital's abortion boards. A greater recognition of the need for free-standing abortion clinics grew as a result, and  doctors came forward voicing support; some  even made clinic appointments for their .  patients. S.Wf4i!^ -£*»'  Anti-choice-: protestors have dwindled dramatically, allowing women access to the  Sco^t clinic without fear of harassment,  an$;i>ra.y a small pocket of protestor's re-  ;nma4pg«-a& the Morgentaler Clinic. Meanwhile  !->si^fij^one coiranurapy and church groupjS£#^  '•'asisvigll-as countless individuals, have  pledged support for the clinics. J'^zSt  "I can turn to anyone on the street and  get help," said Colodny. "When you put  your finger to the wind you can feel the  gale of support for choice and the Clinic."  Less positive developments in the Toronto  choice movement during the past year included the on-going investigation of the  clients by Attorney General Ian Scott and  the police. Since the opening of the second clinic the threat of arrest has loomed  8  Kinesis October TO  ominously over both clinics, causing less  than ideal working conditions.  "It was intimidating to not know when we'd  be arrested", said Colodny "and we'd see  plainclothes cops following women as they  left the clinic, calling them at home...  there wasn't only the anti-choice people  to contend with but also the morality  squad."  Developments in Toronto are closely watched throughout Canada, particularly in  provinces where a woman's access to abortion is most threatened.  Women in British Columbia, for example, are  forced to endure insults by Premier Vander  Zalm who, entirely oblivious to (or disinterested in) the trauma involved in seeking and having an abortion, publicly  stated that women 'use' abortion as birth  control and that he intends to personally  investigate the so-called misuse of therapeutic abortion boards.  Meanwhile, Concerned Citizens for Choice  on Abortion (CCCA) have stepped forward  and announced plans to open a Vancouver  clinic within the next twelve months, in  clear defiance of Attorney General Brian  Smith who promises he will close it down  immediately.  "We would advise Mr. Vander Zalm and Mr.  Smith to sit back and take some lessons  from what's happening in other provinces"  said Nora Hutchinson of CCCA, in reference  to the success of the Toronto clinics.  Hutchinson was quoted here before the doctors' recent arrest. "This action in Ontario can't harass us into silence", she has  since added, "We're not going to reconsider  opening a clinic in Vancouver."  •^In-tither provinces women are being further  restricted from access to abortions.  • Manitoba: Dr. Morgentaler has been denied  a bid for his licence renewal by the Manitoba College of Physicians and Surgeons.  No abortions have been preformed at the  Winnipeg clinic since the 1983 raid and  subsequent closure.  • Quebec: The Quebec government has cut the  amount -of money it pays doctors performing  abortions. Also, due to the social stigma  linked to abortion, it is increasingly difficult to attract doctors. Women are now  forced to wait three weeks for a preliminary appointment with a social worker whereas it used to be a ten day wait.  • Prince Edward Island: Legal abortions are  not available because there in no PEI hospital with a therapeutic abortion committee.  Efforts to mount a legal case to force the  government to act are floundering since  women's rights advocates in PEI expect no  woman seeking an abortion would be willing  to.act as a plaintiff in such a case. Meanwhile women are. forced to travel to Maine  or Montreal, the closest places where there  are abortion clinics.  • Newfoundland: Legal abortions are not  available because the only doctor who was  willing to perform them is ill.  The Toronto arrests as well as the pr^o^lf'  developments at the Morgentaler and Scott \  clinics are significant to the country as  a whole, particularly in light of clinics  and therapeutic abortion boards under  attack elsewhere. Questions concerning the  arrests come easily to mind but are less  easily answered.  Who was responsible, Attorney General Ian  Scott or the police? Scott claims his wishes were defied and that the police arrested  on their own initiative. And yet, the Attorney General's investigation had been per-  sistent and ruthless for almost six months,  with arrest and clinic closure the anticipated conclusion.  "There is no doubt that the decision to  charge us was a political decision made at  the highest cabinet level", says Nikki  Colodny. "There are disclaimers coming from  Ian Scott to counter this and yet it entirely contradicts the public statements he's  made up to this very day."  If it was the police who decided to arrest  the doctors, why did they decide this?  Why would they arrest without solid Crown  support backing them? Finally, are the Ontario police communicating their strategy  to police in other provinces, therefore  leaving us vulnerable to similar harassment^  Ordering a stay on proceedings, Ian Scott  told reporters, was the most difficult  decision of his life. Why then did he make  it? Nikki Colodny calls the stay a victory  precisely because it contradicts Scott's  previous plans to make arrests, apply heavy  bail conditions and force the clinics to  close..  us*  She calls the stay a "political].y expedient  solution to get the government out of an  action that they knew would bring tremendous criticism on them...the public outcry  would've been so great that it was a political liability."  A major question that remains is why were  the arrests made now, when in less than two  weeks the Supreme Court hearing will begin?  A final and perhaps moat..significant question one must consider concerning the  arrests and other abortion-related issues  is—to what degree is.the federal government involved? It's clear that abortion is  under attack throughout the country so that  even legal access is becoming increasingly  limited. On top of this is the intention  of pro-choice groups.in British Columbiai to  open a free-standing abortion clinic in  Vancouver. The pressure is mounting; how  are the feds responding—and what influences  are they having provincially?  \  Commenting on the Supreme Court case against  Morgentaler, Scott and Smalling, Dr. Nikki  Colodny said: "This kind' of political use  of the courts to try to appease different  factions as they see fit is both cynical and  immoral." r^j-SS'fes^  The powerful significance of the upcoming  Supreme Court decision must be realized. If  the doctors original acquittal is upheld,  doctors may be free to open and operate abor  tion clinics country-wide. If the acquittal  is reversed—what are we to expect from  Canada's lawmakers? Will they continue to  act without morals or will they move to ensure all Canadian women equality of access  to abortion? Across Canada  Nova Scotia  Gays attacked by Attorney - General  by Eunice Brooks  Because the Charter of Rights  and Freedoms, now some four  years old, protects minorities  from discrimination, the province of Nova Scotia is threatening to opt out of it. In ■ ,  the Charter certain fundamental  values were removed from the  reach and use of legislators,  and entrusted to the courts.  Minorities are protected from  the tyranny of the majority  by the courts. One minority  in Nova Scotia that has caused  much in-fighting is a group  of homosexual police officers.  Nova Scotia's Attorney-General,  Ron Griffin, told a meeting of  police chiefs that he disagreed with the federal government 's stand that homosexuals  should have full access to the  military and police forces.  Griffin maintains that if the  courts rule in favour of  homosexual rights, Nova  Scotia would use section 33  to over-ride provision for  the Charter, and pass legislation banning homosexuals  from municipal police forces.  He also said that the courts  are going too far in protecting individual rights. Griffin  says someone has to speak  for the majority, and he will.  . He claims to speak for the  solid, right-thinking majority  whose voices are being drowned  out by minorities. He is supported in his views by Nova  Scotia's Social Services Minister, Edmund Morris, who has  denied welfare benefits to  teen-aged mothers, as well as  to single fathers.  Even Premier John Buchanan has  shown hostility to the Charter  of Rights and Freedoms. There  has been no affirmative action  in the hiring of women, ethnics  New porn  bill possible  The new Justice Minister, Ramon  Hnatyshyn, has said that the  Conservative anti-pornography  legislation will be changed  after it is re-introduced when  the parliamentarly session begins Oct. 1.  The bill's broad definition of  pornography caused an uproar  after it was introduced last  spring by former justice minister John Crosbie.  The bill would amend the Criminal Code to define pornography as "any visual material  showing vaginal, anal or oral  intercourse, ejaculation, sexually violent behavior, beast-  iality, incest, necrophilia,  masturbation or other sexual  activity."  Hnatysjyn has said the defini-  tion may have to be changed.  or disabled people. Legislation protecting the disabled  was poor in comparison with  what other provinces have put  forward. However the Premier's  office,"when given an opportunity to comment on the  Griffin speech, did not repudiate him, and that seems' as  good as backing him to the  persons who are shocked by  such words from an Attorney-  General .  Joe Ross, executive director  of the Police Association of  Nova Scotia said he will fight  the Attorney-General's office  in court if any officers are  fired because they are gay. A  member of the Civil Rights  Committee of the Gay Alliance  in Halifax said Griffin may  believe he represents Nova  Scotia in his opinions, but he  has not consulted with police  officers. He-said that Griffin  went too far in his speech,  but that the man is too stubborn to back down. The ruckus  included front-page headlines  in the Halifax press which  stated: "Griffin must so!"  An editorial in the Halifax  Daily News  called his attack  on the Charter hopeless, and  said that the federal government would never let Nova  Scotia opt out of - anything  except his job.  MP Howard Crosby (PC-Halifax  West) came close to calling  for Griffin's resignation,  and said that Griffin should  resign voluntarily. He said an  Attorney-General was meant to  uphold rights.  But people who speak against  Nova Scotia's government have  learned it can be costly. Funding was cut to Dalhousie Legal  Aid, a poverty law clinic,  because it openly disagreed  with social policies and advocated law reform. Social  Services Minister, Edmund  Morris called the group "an  NDP training ground," and  funding stopped.  Wayne MacKay, a professor of  constitutional law at Dalhousie  University has said: "If the  Charter cannot protect the  dispossessed and disadvantaged,  it is not worthy of our  Constitution and we should  abandon the illusion that it  can promote justice and equality for Nova Scotians."  Pratt 3 win settlement  People can fight for democrat- -.  ic rights and win. A $20,000  out of court settlement in  June 1986, for Kay Le Rougetel,  Wendy Stevenson, and Suzanne  Chabot tells the story for  the little people.  Pratt and Whitney Aircraft  Corporation at Longueuil, Quebec had to pay up. It was a  seven year battle. Three women  took on the bosses and the  RCMP. Guess who won?  Back in Novemeber 1979, the  three were fired from their  jobs at the Pratt and Whitney  Aircraft Corporation in Quebec  for having joined an organization called the Revolutionary  Workers League. Five months  Man in  the house  In a move that could inspire  similar changes in other provinces, the Ontario government  has agreed to abolish controversial "man in the house"  regulations for single mothers who need welfare.  Under the changes a single •  mother will not be denied  welfare if she sleeps with a  friend or gets occasional  financial help. The main  criteria will be whether the  two are living as if they were  spouses and whether the male  actually supports the children  in the home or has a legal  obligation to support them.  later Stevenson and Chabot were  again fired from the crown corporation Canadair. On the same  day, Le Rougetel was fired from  Canadian Marconi, another defense industry plant.  The Union of Auto Workers (UAW)  submitted grievances at Pratt  .and Whitney on behalf of the  women. UAW also registered a  . -complaint with the Quebec Hu-  "man Rights Commission. The  Commission found Pratt and  Whitney/guilty of discrimination in the firings and determined that the RCMP had interfered by giving the company  information on the women. The  Commission also determined that  Canadair was guilty of discrimination, but did not find Canadian Marconi guilty in the  firing of Le Rougetel.  The Commission sued Pratt and  Whitney on behalf of the three  women demanding that they be  rehired with financial compensation. Over the last several  years the battle raged through  the lower courts. The women  were aided by the Pratt Three  Defense Committee, which  united women's and civil liberties groups, unions, and six  federal NDP-MPs, including  Ed Broadbent.  The three did not win back  their jobs, but they have  caused a good look at Canada's  security police and their  role in victimizing those who  fight for social justice.  Charter and  native women  The National Action Committee  on the Status of Women (NAC)  will pressure the federal and  provincial governments to entrench a sexual equality clause  for all aboriginal people that  will guarantee sexual equality  with respect to "other rights  and freedoms" in the Canadian  constitution. •  NAC's- Committee to Support  Native Women pointed out that  native women have justifiable '  reason to believe that only  equality of existing aboriginal and'treaty rights are protected and there is no constitutional guarantee of sexual  equality with respect to other  rights and freedoms. Specifically, independent self-government is outside section 35,  part II of the constitution  and therefore outside the protection of the sexual equality  guarantees in that section.  Housing remains a problem for  native people in general, and  reinstated native women specifically. NAC will also pressure the federal government  to reinstate all cutbacks in■  federal government funds for  housing of native peoples  since the September, 1984  federal electi ons.  The government should provide-  two distinct funds;, with separate accountability proce-  dures: one to ensure adequate  housing for resident band  members and one for adequate  housing for reinstated women  and their children who wish  to return to the reserves. .  NAC will also wpr^i|o.th native  women's, and other organizations, to obtain umbrella legislation comparable to the  U.S. Indian Child Welfare Act  of 1978. Forty to fifty percent of children in care in  British Columbia are native  children and many are never  allowed to return to families.  NAC will call for an ombuds-  person's office to mediate  disputes involving native  women who wish to avail themselves of their rights in  accordance with the amended  Indian Act of 1985. The amendments provided that native  yjgmen who lost their Indian  Status as a result of marrying  white men have regained their  status.  October TO Kinesis     9 LABOUR  Women face complex issues nationally  by Marion Pollack  For the first time in Canada a major trade  union central, the Canadian Labour Congress,  has a woman as its president. This marks  the first time that a national union central in North'America and Europe has been  headed' by a woman. But, the question remains, is the trade union movement open to  women's isstfeSjand needs, or is the election of Shirley Carr as CLC president merely  symbolic? |  The Canadian Labour Congress is the largest  trade union central in Canada. Its membership comprises a whole variety of international and national unions, labour councils  and Federations of Labour. Unions affiliated  to the CLC include the - International Ladies  Garment Workers Union, the Canadian Auto-  workers Union, the United Steelworkers of  America, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the International Woodworkers, of America, and Canadian Union of Postal Workers.  At the local level some unions which are  affiliated to the CLC make up labour councils.- For example, a number of locals in  the Vancouver area are part of the Vancouver  and District Labour Council. On a provincial  basis, many of these unions belong to the  BC Federation of Labour.  The CLC holds biannual conventions at which  the direction for the labour movement is  discussed and debated and where executive  officers are elected. The most recent CLC  convention took place in May of this year.  On paper the CLC seems to be putting forward  pro-woman positions. There is an affirmative action component to the elections,  which ensures that a specific number of executive positions are reserved for women. The  Congress also holds a regular women's conference. It has an active, although appointed, women's committee. Finally, the CLC has  taken good positions in favour of choice,  equal pay, affirmative action, universal  daycare and so on.  One problem is that there is not a forum for  accountability for these elected women^s  Baseline will design your brochure, typeset  your newsletter, paste-up your program,  reduce or enlarge your illustrations,  and halftone screen that photo.  At decidedly reasonable rates.  let Baseline  be your line  to printed communication  can 683-5038  tions, I vote for women to represent me, but  find that there are no channels to have my  and other women's concerns addressed.  While the CLC has good policies, there has  been a constant problem in getting these  policies acted upon. One example of this is  the fight for the shorter work week. Since  at least 1978 there has been policy calling  for the CLC to carry out a major campaign  in favour of the shorter work week, but this  has not materialized. The same goes for  resolutions on equal pay for work of equal  value. While the CLC policy is good, there  still has not been a nationwide campaign.  The list is endless.  Since the last CLC Convention there has been  a noticeable change in its level of activity.  Shirley Carr has been very visible in supporting thfv^Gainers strikers in Edmonton.  ' She has made very positive and clear statements of support for the striking Newfoundland workers. She has been more accessible  to other unions than her predecessor, Dennis  McDermott.  In the past couple of years, the CLC has participated in the strikes of the bankworkers  at the Visa Centre of the Canadian Imperial  Bank of Commerce, and the workers at Eaton's  stores. These strikers were mainly women,  working in traditional women's jobs. The  very fact that the CLC donated money and  material support to these strikes is a  strong indication of the increasing strength  of women in and outside of the trade union  movment. However, with its nationwide resources, the CLC certainly could have developed  more effective boycott and support actions  than it did.  The last CLC Convention was another example -  of the role of women in the trade union  movement. While more women spoke at the mics  than ever before, and more 'women spoke on  a wider variety of issues,'the noise level  in the Convention hall still rose anytime  a woman's voice was heard.  Women's issues have made some gain in the  trade union movement. Almost every Federation of Labour has policies in favour of  the right to choose. The Ontario Federation of Labour has played a significant  and important role in continuing to defend  Dr. Morgentaler. What is needed for the  future is to develop more links between  women in and outside the union movement.  Women workers are being faced with some new  issues which have to be addressed from a  feminist perspective. These are free trade,  privatization, and deregulation. In many  ways if these three Conservative government  policies get implemented, the gains women  have made in the past ten years will be  wiped out. Various studies have, shown that  if free trade goes through, the clothing,  |   CLC President Shirley Carr is  I*   approached by the president of a  member union at the conference  ■§■   which elected her.  textiles, food processing, shoe-making and  other light industries will be adversely  affected. These are precisely the industries  that women are concentrated in. With the  advent of free trade, we can expect to see  massive job losses for women.  Given current trends, it will-not be easy  for women to find other full time, decently  paid jobs. The latest stastistics are^shQw^-'  ing that part time work, at minimum or  slightly above minimum wage, is the only "type  of employment that is increasing.  When there is massive job loss in certain  sectors of society it has a so-called multiplier effect. This means that if you layoff factory workers, other categories of  workers such as clerical workers, teachers,  healthcare workers, salespeople etc. also  get laid off. Free trade therefore will  result in women in a lot of different jobs  becoming unemployed. Unemployment stats also  show that women tend to be unemployed for  longer periods of time than men. The final  insidious aspect of free trade is thatHhe  U.S. wants to put social programmes on the  bargaining table.  Deregulation will also hurt women. Deregulation is the removal of government rules  and regulations governing certain specific  industries. While on paper it sounds like  the removal of red tape, the reality is that  deregulation causes lay-offs, hurts small  communities, and reduces services. The  best example of this is the airline  industry in the US. Since the government  deregulated there have been literally  hundreds and thousands of lay-offs.  This has affected stewardesses, reservation agents, and so—mainly women.  Airline deregulation has also led to  hundreds of small communities having  their airline services reduced or  eliminated totally. When there are cutbacks in services to small communities,  it is women who usually have to pick  up the slack.  Women in BC have seen the effects of privatization as the selling of services to  the lowest bidder. In the summer of 1985  the government "temporarily" closed down  Vancouver transition house. This left battered women without any safe government-  sponsored refuge in Vancouver. Privatization has also meant that services to  women in BC have deteriorated. Privatization has also resulted in lay-offs,  and decreased wages for those workers  still left.  The Canadian Labour Congress has pledged  to spearhead a fight against privatization,  deregulation, and' free trade'. In Ontario  the campaign is beginning with leaflets and  demonstrations. It has yet to hit British  Columbia. Perhaps, one of the acid tests for  the labour movment in the 1980's is how the  CLC develops and carries out this campaign.  10    Kinesis October TO SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SSSS/SSSSSSSSSSS/SSSS///S  by Nora Randall  I recently met a woman who grew up white in  South Africa.  Now I know that sounds like  a strange way to put it,  but from her  story it seems to be the most accurate.  Her  family was put in a racial category.  Hearing  her talk about her childhood experiences,  I was struck by how alien a landscape a  racist society is to a child.  I asked her  if she would write about her childhood for  this column.  She said she was glad for the  chance because she 's been trying to get her  experiences down on paper.  What follows is  just a tiny bit of her story.  Growing up in South Africa was totally confusing to me. It was through experience  that I figured it out.  Take my summer holidays for example. On  these days, my mother would be up early and  by seven o'clock would have done all the  cooking and cleaning for the day. My father  would have been out in the fields since  dawn. By the time he returned for breakfast,  the porridge would be ready on the side of  the stove and the fire would be out. No  fire meant no hot water but that was fine  in such heat. Many people in South Africa  work these hours, if they can.

Children under  7 free.  My favourite time was spent in the veld and  playing near the river. I loved to be out  in the sun. This worried my mother and she  made clothes to keep the sun off me and  admonished me always to wear a hat. When I  returned from outside she would say, "Look  how dark you are. I've told you to keep  out of the sun—they are not going to accept  you into the high school."  I vaguely knew what this meant; that my skin  was too dark and no white person wanted to  look too much like them.   But I loved the intensity of the sun. Besides, I had thought  this through carefully. Sure, my father was  dark, but he was in the sun all day. I had  never seen his father but he had studied in  Europe, so he must have been white. (There .  was no evidence of black people receiving  higher education around me). I could see all  my other grandparents were white. So I felt  safe and Ignored my mother's scoldings.  I thought of all this many times especially  when the kids at school would call me derogatory names for black people. Then I would  check with my parents again to see if there  was any possibility of my grandparents  being black. Their assurance relieved me.  Not only because it allowed me to ignore  the teasing of the other kids, but because  I could see how hard the lives of black  people were. We were poor, but at least  we were not black. I could see that meant  being even poorer and we were poor enough.  As I grew older I had a number of experiences that taught me how arbitrary the  whole system was. At that time there were  separate lines everywhere for black and  white. I took to lining up in whichever  of the lines was shorter. In the summer  I was more likely to be thrown out of the  white line, and sent back to the black line..  THE  \ftNCOUVER  OUTDOOR  CLUB  FORWOMEN  ORGANIZED AND RUN BY WOMEN  LEARN NEW SKILLS  For more  information  phone:  Deb 255-5288  Linda 876-3506  One day I went to the police station with  a brown woman to report a beating. There  was no one in either line. We entered  what was termed the "non-European" slide.  The police officer insisted that I go into  the white side. I argued with him that  the woman and I were the same colour. He  heard that my accent was different and  insisted that I go around to the white side  and conduct my side of the conversation  around the partition.  Another time, when I visisted a black  friend in a black hospital, I was shouted  at by a white nurse who called me a "Totti"  (a derogatory term for blacks derived from  Hottentot) and told me to leave. As I  was doing so I saw a white friend from  school and said hello. When the obnoxious  nurse saw me talking to my white friend she  assumed I was white and came over and apolT  ogized and told me I could stay. And so it  went.  Of course I questioned my parents more  closely—where was my father's paternal  family from? "Well, North Africa," said my  mother, looking away.  Then I understood why my mother had tried  so hard to keep me out of the sun, and  why we were not allowed to play with the  Zulu children on the farms—or even learn  their language.  I felt sad at my mother's pathetic role in  trying to protect me so that I would get  a better education and maintain the family's  societal privileges. And I feel angry now  that I perpetuate her role of protector by  not signing my name to this column. My  family is still in South Africa. Even though!  my parents would be allowed to be legally  married now (since some "interracial" marriages are now approved), they still live  under the threat of having to move to a  "black community" should the government  discover that they categorized my father  "white" instead of "coloured" when they  began their arbitrary "colour" classification system.  No person would easily choose the daily  humiliation the government inflicts on  black people in South Africa.  Now I -long for the African sun and hope to  return some day when my child is old enough  It is not difficult for me to be part of  the revolution.  NEED  INFORMATION?  WANT TO  TALK?

Answer:  Female human beings.  This aspect of Indian society  was explored at a "Forum  Against Sex Determination and  Preselection" where Ravindra  R.P. presented a paper denoun-  sing the non-medical uses of  reproductive technology.  'In India today, amniocentesis  is used almost exclusively to  determine the gender of a  foetus, the practical result  being the aborting of unwanted  females. Amniocentesis was originally developed as a technique for detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Ravindra  stated that few people are even  aware of its traditional function, so widespread is its use  as a sex determinant.  Amniocentesis is, however, a  less than ideal tool for this  purpose. It is performed by  inserting a long needle through  the woman's abdomen and into  the amniotic sac inside her  womb. The foetus floats within  the sac's fluid and foetal  cells will be present in the  fluid extracted; the cells  are then subjected to a chrom-  osonal analysis. The procedure  is painful—and hazardous. The  needle may puncture and damage  the foetus and/or cause spontaneous abortion. Amniocentesis' major flaw as a sex determinant is that it cannot  be performed until the end of  the fourth month of pregnancy,  a risky and difficult time to  induce abortion.  But other methods of gaining  chromosomal—and hence, gender—  information about foetuses  are being pursued. The Chorionic Villi Biopsy involves  entering the cervix and removing cells (villi) from the  chorionic region of the uterus, using ultrasound as a guide.  A three to five percent chance  of bleeding, pain and spontaneous abortion exists. The procedure allows for a first trimester abortion since it may  be carried out before the thirteenth week of pregnancy.  Other sex determination techniques still in exploratory  stages involve studying hormonal levels in a mother's blood  or saliva, and extracting foetal  cells from the mother's blood.  Ravindra noted that, given the  relatively non-invasive, risk-  free aspects of these future  .'methods, concern for foetal  and maternal health will no  longer be grounds to protest  the overall practice: "opposition should now come from a  more basic ideological angle."  As well it must, in the light  of the equally odious phenomen-  12    Kinesis October TO  on of gender preselection  technology. The Indian marketplace  offers numerous products which  claim to produce male offspring.  "Sex preselection is used exclusively for begetting sons,"  said Ravindra. In Gujarat, a  product called "Select" boasts  an eighty to eighty-five percent  success rate via oral capsules  to the mother in her second  month of pregnancy. The government hospital of Poddar Ayurvedic is researching a nasal  drop therapy.  Other approaches involve altering the environment of the  woman's reproductive tract (with  douches and diets) in order to  render it more hospitable to  .sperm bearing the male chromosome. People pay huge sums for  these techniques, none of which  have any proven reliability.  To date, In Vitro Fertilization  (test-tube) is the one area  where sex preselection has.possibilities. Because of minute  differences between the physical  properties of the X (female) and  Y (male) sperm, they can be separated outJ the Y-rich portion  is then used in the IVF process.  Complete separation still eludes  researchers but it is an area  that attracts much interest.  Ravindra is uncompromising in  her denunciation'of these evils.  "Technologies to-improve the  quality of life for women are  either not explored or, if explored, hardly implemented.  Clean water and basic sanitation  facilities have not reached most  villages. The infant mortality  rate, especially for females, is  one of the highest in the world.  But technology which can be  used for anti-woman purposes is  readily accepted in all strata  of society."  But not, as the Forum proves,  without resistance.

In a 5-4 majority decision, the  highest court leaned in favor  of policing America's bedrooms.  The case of Bowers v.

Hardwick was charged with breaking  Banks accused of extortion  Think what would happen to  your bank account if the Third  World Countries refused to repay loans to industrialized  nations. Loans on which the  interest rates are rising so  fast that many countries have  been forced to cut internal  .services such as education,  agricultural services, immunization and other health care,  and food subsidies.  Third World countries owe  debts with horrific interest  rates amounting to, for example, more than $60 billion a  year from Latin America. Interest rates are escalating due, .  largely, to the US deficit,  which in turn is increasing  because of Reagan's arms spending policy. In some cases,  the interest countries pay on  debt is going to the country  which is amassing arms to  control the whole western hemisphere .  In the United Kingdom a movement called War on Want (WOW)  has been launched to get the  people to talk to bank managers and members of parliament,  expressing concern that loans  are unbearable for some impoverished countries, such as  Ethiopia. WOW is asking people  to apply pressure on banks to  re-negotiate interest rates  and repayment schedules, before  the money is gone with no hope  of it ever being repaid.  Don't use me!"  WOW accuses the British banks  of extortion. In Third World  countries, rising unemployment  and a drop in the standard of  living are causing vast hardship. Often loans were for  arms, not to improve the standard of living.  At the end of the Nairobi UN  Decade of Women Conference a  resolution was passed by Third  World women to campaign against the debt crisis. They appealed to western women to  join them. African nations  have requested $80 billion  from-the United Nations to  cover debts.  Non-payment of loans would ruin  western industrialized economies.  a Georgia statute which says:  (emphasis ours) "Any person  commits the offense of sodomy  when he performs or submits to  any sexual act involving the  sex organs of one person and  the mouth or anus of another..."  Georgia is only one of 24 states  which have similar anti-sodomy  laws.  In Georgia conviction brings  a penalty of not less than one  year or more than twenty.  Hardwick challenged the constitutionality of the law in federal Supreme Court and lost.  His claim was that the state  statute violated his fundamental rights, in that homosexual  activities are private and intimate associations beyond the  reach of the law.  The Supreme Court's decision,  written by Justice Byron White,  stated that the constitution  did not confer a right to adult  homosexuals to engage in private consensual sodomy. The  court reiterated that sodomy is,  in some states, a criminal  offense.  Chief Justice Warren Burger reviewed the historical proscriptions against sodomy, quoting  an 18th century jurist, Sir  William Blackstone, who said:  "The infamous crime against  nature is an offense of deeper  malignity than rape, a heinous  crime, the very mention of  which is a disgrace to human  nature and a crime not fit to  be named." Burger was one of  the majority of five.  Also among the majority was  Sandra Day O'Connor. The dissenters were Justices Harry  Blackmun, William Brennan, Paul  Stevens and Thurgood Marshall.  Blackmun read his opinion to  the press from the bench, an  unusual move that underlined  his outrage.

Guatemalan  women  remember  atrocities  by Eunice Brooks  In Guatemala,; j-governmen"fe.rjas^ .Tj.  army officials have denounced  the Mutual Support Group for  the Reappearance Alive of Our  Disappeared Loved Ones as a  puppet of international agitators.  The group was founded in 1984  | by a J"ew women. who met at  morgues and government offices  searching for missing family  members. They provide emotional' support for one another, and  act as a lobby group seeking  explanations for some 40,000  missing Guatemalans who have  disappeared in the past five  years. The women are ever  targets for harassment. In only  two years, two of its leaders  have been assassinated. Because  of the murders, one thousand  women took to the streets, in  protest.  The group demands the military  dictator General Mejia Victores  provide information on atrocities that took place during  his regime. Now, a new President, Christian Democrat  Vinicio Cerezo, has declared  an unconditional amnesty for  all members of the army, granting them immunity from trials  for past crimes.  Nineth de Garcia, one of the  group's founders says: "Collective amnesia is unconstitutional, and in no way acceptable."  The Mutual Support Group will  not forget the past. They have  submitted 1500 writs of habeas  corpus to the country's highest court.  The McCarren-Walter Act was a  bill passed despite the veto of  President Harry Truman during  the McCarthy era.

The so called "victim specific"  interpretation of civil rights  law presented by Attorney '  General Edwin Meese and the  Justice Department — that legal action can be taken only  for the individual victim of  discrimination and not for classes of people—was termed misguided by the Court.  William Rehnquist, Reagan's  recently accepted nominee for  Chief Justice of the Court,  voted against the majority in  both cases, condemning what he  called "the evil of court-sanctioned racial quotas."

The Coalition says that "reactionaries" in the Reagan administration may use this ruling to intimidate and silence  the lesbian and gay community,  although it appears exactly  the opposite has happened.

October TO Kinesis   13  - " PORNOGRAPHY  The following is a position paper on pornography authored by the Working Group  on Sexual Violence.  It is a description of  and a contribution to the ongoing feminist  debate on pornography.   The paper has been  endorsed by members of the Ontario based  Civil Rights and Remedies Committee  (CRRC).  The CRRC was formed in 1985.   Their goals  include education on pornography and the  development of a comprehensive scheme for  the establishment of civil remedies  against pornography.  Building on the long history of women  organizing to stop the sexual exploitation  of women and children, the advent of the  'second wave' of feminism in the late sixties precipitated the recent growth of concern about violence against women.  Consciousness-raising groups provided the  first safe forums for women to begin to  describe the experience'of their lives—  and provided an audience of women who were  interested enough to'listen. The creation  and growth of women's centres, rape crisis  centres and transition houses were a direct result of women acting on what they  heard.  For the last twenty years we feminists have  been teaching ourselves to listen more  carefully, and to take what women tell us  out into the world. Many of us have had to  face stories of greater brutality and greater barbarism than we would have thought was  possible. Over time, we have peeled back  the layers of sexism and silence to discover the many methods of sexual subordination;  employment discrimination, sexual harassment, rape, wife-battering, prostitution,  incest, child sexual abuse, sexual abuse  of older women—and pornography.  We came to understand women's oppression  as a continuum, encompassing a widely  disparate range of issues, related in  source, significance and impact. We know  it is not possible to eradicate any one  form of women's oppression without also  responding to all other associated forms  of oppression. But our experience has  taught us that this at times overwhelming  continuum cannot be an excuse for ignoring individual issues. The continuum of  women's oppression cannot be broken until  we break the silence and address each of  those issues which harm us—never for a  moment forgetting the links that make the  oppression so successful.  Having been raised in a 'liberal society',  many of us had ignored pornography, assuming it was merely sexually explicit pictures—sex education at best, tasteless at  worst. Years later, having spent time with  the victims of male violence, we took  another look and found the sexually explicit pictures were in fact a distorted glorification of the abuse suffered by women  we had talked to.  We saw images of women bound, gagged,  whipped, raped, infantilized, burned,  chained, defecated, urinated and ejaculated upon, images which lauded the hatred  of women. Since we'd last looked, pornography had grown more widespread, more  malevolent, more acceptable, more profitable, and more overtly violent. We recognized the male voice of the pornographers  was much louder than the voice's of the  women on the pages of the magazines or on  our crisis lines. And we got angry.  Those same angry women organized community  forums, Take Back the Night marches, and a  range of other attacks on the industry.  We spoke, wrote, distributed leaflets,  spray-painted, picketed and protested. Some  women firebombed. Some made films. The film  The Pornography  Not A Love Story  captured some of our  analysis and our anger and took it out to  a wider audience, broadening the debate.  Broadening the debate meant taking it  beyond the normal reach of the feminist  community. And women, many of whom were  not feminists, recognized some of their  own experience in those images and in our  words.  Then what happened  These women wanted pornography and pornographers stopped. They wanted the lies  stifled. The wanted the abuse in and by  those pictures to end. So they took the  information and their own understanding  about the way the world (and the state)  The March 1983 VSW pornography forum at Robson  Square attracted 200 people to discuss pornography and  strategies to fight it.  works and proceeded to try to stop pornography. They called upon the police to  prosecute, the consumers to boycott, the  censors to censor, and the legislators  to legislate. Many didn't want to stick  around for hair-splitting discussions on  what pornography was—they knew what it  was and they wanted it not to be—anymore.  As each level of the state insisted they  could do nothing, women looked to the  next, more powerful level. There was sometimes little recognition that those called  upon for assistance were men who themselves learned about women through pornography. So the men in power saw the women  who called upon them to silence the pornographers as having more in common with  the women in the pictures than with themselves .  Faced with deciding "how bad is it" these  men could choose between their direct experience of physiological effect (whether  it gave them an erection)—or a perception  of what their wives and daughters ought  not to see. Having ignored the voices of  the victims of sexual subordination for so  long they would not see the harm, only the  offense. Defining the physiological effects  as their own private right, and convinced  that their wives and daughters would not  look—they did nothing. And that made the  women more angry, and louder.  Then they asked the rhetorical question:  what do you women want anyway? The women  answered differently. Some called for  changes to the criminal code, some for  censorship boards, some for regulation,  some for human rights codes, some for civil remedies and almost all for education.  Many of those of us who spoke about the  connection between pornography and violence  against women were skeptical about calling  upon the patriarchal state to intervene  on our behalf. We focussed on education  and direct action. But we soon found that  a consequence of our work was -that other  women took this new understanalng of pornography as harmful and demanded that the  state do something about it. The debate  moved from the community centres, the  feminist press and the streets into the  hallways of the legislatures and into the  mainstream media.  The controversy  The voices of women calling for the silencing- of pornographers were soon joined  by the voices of men and women for the  protection of the family and of the morality of the community. Taking the 'sexual'  out of 'sexual subordination', men and  women on the right demanded an end to  "smut", insisting that non-heterosexual sex  be put back in the closet and genitals and  extra-marital sex be hidden in brothels,  at stag parties, or in magazines under the  mattress.  v l PEG  A scene from Night Without Fear, Laurie Meeker's film about violence against women. Shown is a Red Hot  Video outlet, bombed in November 1982.  14    Kinesis October TO  Paper  Feminists struggled with trying to hold on  to the experience of women, trying to define pornography in a way which said what  it was and what it did. Some tried to explain pornography as not sex and not about  sex but about power. About men defining  women's sexuality and about the use of  male power against women through sex. The  latter argument was unacceptable, rendered  inaudible in the hallways of the legislature and in the mainstream media.  As feminists who saw pornography as about  male power and the sexual subordination  of women we looked for a way to remove  the power of speech from the pornographers  and from the police and to place that power in the hands of the women who experien^  ced harm. We talked about defamation, damages and our human rights.  Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin are  two American feminists who talked with  those who suffered damage and translated  what they heard into a civil ordinance.  Together they and many other women lobbied  intensively for its passage in Minneapolis  and in Indianapolis. And what they said  and where they said it became news. As  patriotic Americans, the left and the liberals attacked it  as unconstitutional and  them  as suppressors of freedom of speech  and underminers of civil liberties.  Vancouver protest against Canadian Radio Television-  Telecommunications Commission decisions which removed  restrictions on racism and sexism in programming, February  1984.  Freedom of speech and civil liberties are  very valuable commodities to those who  don't have them. The left and women have  a history of being short-changed. There  was a very strong reaction against assumed  'allies' apparently giving those rights  away; this reaction was particularly  strong from those on the left and from  those women who have some rights and fear  they have something to lose. They called  the threat "censorship"—and they called .  those who spoke about freedom of speech  for all women "pro-censorship".  To be anti-censorship is, in effect, to be  in favour of freedom of speech for pornographers. Further, it is to define pornography as speech and not practice. But  pornography is about denying women speech,  about binding women's mouths closed, about  putting false words on their lips, about  murder and torture and rape and submission  and seduction in pictures and in practice,  with the pictures. And so being anti-censorship is about valuing the words of those  who are anti-censorship over the words of  the women who are pictured and practiced on-  and in particular over the words of those  women who talk about what that means.  In early 1983 people picketed various BC Red Hot Video outlets, culminating in a week long!  picket in May at the Main Street store in Vancouver.  However there are those who attempt to  value both equally. Accepting that pornography is sexist and degrading, they argue  that it must be counteracted with organizing, education, and the development of  a 'feminist erotica'. They argue that the  voices of women and left-thinking men will  drown out the voices of pornographers and  we will all live happily ever after—or  if not happily, at least we won't be censored .  But what voices you hear depends on where  you are. For those women who are raped  today, for those women whose men force them  to act like the women in the pictures, for  those women who are coerced into posing,  and for those children who are learning  wha^^fex Is and wha^ women ea^M%&$Mi&^i.  videos' and magazines-i^^he local■ J||litif|M~  or in their homes, and for those women in  our movement who help the'survivors come  to terms with those experiences, the  voices of the harmed are louder than the  voices of those preaching a feminist erotica. t£Wi«e4i&s  It is probably safe to say that for most  of the population the voices of the pornographers and their customers are more  audible, indeed they overpower those who  dream out loud of a feminist sexual discourse.  We know that freedom of speech belongs to  those who own the presses, and among those  who own the presses there is a preponder-  ence of rich, white men. We also know  there is a preponderence of these same  rich, white men in the appartus of the  state—in the legislatures, in the courts,  and practically everywhere decisions are  made about our lives.  The patriarchal capitalist state continues  to profit from and shore up the free-enterprising pornographers while simultaneously  promising women protection from harm, from  defamation, and from violence—and from  infringement of civil liberties. The pornographers claim freedom for themselves  while placing women in bondage; the state  claims to protect liberties, liberties  which are available only to those who.are  permitted, and can afford, to exercise them.  Being a feminist means putting women first  and starting with women's experience. So  we must start with the experience- of women j  as subordinated, as without liberty. In  choosing to address the issue of pornography as one among many facets of women's  oppression, we must start with the experience of women as subordinated, deprived  of liberty, in, by and with the use of  pornography. And we must recognize the  silence and the damage of that experience.  From the starting point, we have sought to  make women's voices audible, in every  available forum, in our communities and in  the courts. To that end we have argued for  and continue to argue for a civil right,  the right of women to pursue, into the  courts, the men who have damaged them.  We have argued against the use of the criminal courts because that would place.the  decisions and the speech in the hands of  the police, and would define 'society' and  not women as harmed.  We are working on defining the nature of  that civil right, and more specifically .  the nature of the harm, a definition based  on women's experience—one which would  allow some compensation for what has been  lost.  There is no compensation for silence nor  for subordination, but we believe that  recognition of that silence and of the  harm, publicly and monetarily, is part of  breaking the silence and stopping the  harm. At the very least it would reduce  some of the profits of those who impose silence and do harm. At best it would give  the silenced and harmed a forum to speak.  The debate about pornography is very much  a debate about freedom of speech. However  the question is not more or less freedom—  but whose  freedom. On this question the  women's movement divides along predictable  lines: the liberals, who seek to enhance  the freedom of the police and censor boards  (while trying to defend sex education, art  and gay rights); the socialists, who oppose  the diminution of their own freedom of  speech (and of everyone else who already  has it); and the radical feminists, who  demand that the voices of women—all  women—he heard.

October TO Kinesis    15  j — !  ■■    ■)■ PRESS GANG  When we get mail addressed to Mr. Dorothy  Elias—President, you know what we're up  against. Now, Mr. Dorothy is a good sport  about such things, but let's face it, it  -get's a bit tedious. There are no men and  no bosses at Vancouver's Press Gang. And  you won't find many printshops that stop  production for two hours every Tuesday  afternoon to meet and discuss everything  from the cat's flea problems to the feas-  ability of unionizing. But then, Press  Gang isn't your ordinary printshop. Looking back, it's clear that it never was.  A couple of people with a small press in  their basement started to get ideas. A  few more people joined in and Press Gang  was born. This was about 1972. The vision  was to print for the alternative and political community in Vancouver, and to  provide a space where people could come,  use equipment and work on their printing  projects. Quality was not a burning issue  back then. Within a short time the collective expanded and Press Gang was ready to  move to its first location in a basement  on East Hastings Street. People froze  their butts in the winter, never saw the  sunlight and tolerated a trough of stag*  nant basement water that ran around the  edge of the room. But it was home.  Within a year more women joined the collective until, at one point, there were '  nine members—six of them women. None of  the women at that time came to the Press  with any knowledge of running a printshop.  politics in print  It was almost totally on-the-job training,  sink or swim. There was a lot of swimming  : going on.  With $300 in the bank Press Gang was one  of the richer groups going. The fact that  the rent was being covered and bills  taken care of was unique for groups struggling to do important political and  community work. But then, no one was being paid either. No* one expected to. It  wasn't ever looked at as a way of making  a living, and most people had other full-  time or part-time paid jobs, or worked at  Press Gang as part of other work going  on in the community.  Sarah Davidson, one of the original Press  Gang cronies who worked at the Press  until 1980, reminisces easily about her  first encounters: "I went down there to  pick up some pamphlets for the Women's  Centre (which later became the Women's  Bookstore) and there was one woman there,  trying to fix something on the large  press. I offered to help. An hour later,  as I was leaving, she asked me if I wanted to join the collective—she wanted more  women there. I just smiled in an understanding way and left."  Sarah had no idea that she was about to  spend the next seven years of her life  with ink under her fingernails and a passion for Press Gang in her heart.  The size of the collective varied drastically. Comings and goings were sporadic  and unpredictable even on a day-to-day  level. Often people worked late into the  night. Constant mechanical and technical  problems sometimes dictated that.  In those early years of the mid-seventies  Press Gang was sustained, in part, by  local job grants. It provided an opportunity to train and work and, quite simply,  get printing done. But that funding wasn't  to last. And Press Gang was changing.  A separation in the collective was emerging.  More and more women were becoming discontent  with the division of labour. They wanted to  I run the larger press and to be involved in  finances. Before long a pattern developed  where the women were working in the day  and the men at night. Finally someone called a meeting to discuss "the problem of  the women at the Press".  Sarah recalls: "It was really quite bizarre.  No one seemed to realize there was anything  wrong with the way that was phrased. Everyone was surprised when I pointed it out."  After this meeting one of the men suggested  the collective split. By that point it  apparently made sense for the women to stay  and keep most of the equipment, and the men  would have "visiting privileges" to use  the facilities. And so, around 1974, Press  Gang became a women's press. Eventually,  the men stopped coming altogether.  By 1976-77 talk began of paying everyone.  A novel concept to say the least. Before  this, people got-paid according to the  'need system'—if you needed the money you  would get it (if it was there). If you  didn't, well, you simply didn't. It was  usual enough back then to be satisfied  with the non-monetary rewards of working  in a collective, doing important political  work, working with women, getting extended  holidays and birthday cakes.  Someone called a meeting to discuss the 'problem'  of women at the Press... it was really quite bizarre.  Around this time the publishing aspect of  Press Gang took form with the production  of its first book: Women Look at Psychiatry.  Everyone in the collective was involved in  both publishing and printing. Gradually  the publishing end of the Press took on a  life of its own. It is now a separate  collective.  There were discussions of better organization, structuring the work day (deliveries  were being missed because there wouldn't  always be someone there), setting up a  bookkeeping system, improving homemade  equipment and getting decent training.  With all this in the air and heated discussions about money, and publishing work  always on the agenda, the collective boat  was rocking.  By 1978 Press Gang was ready to move to its  present location at 603 Powell St. and  half of the collective was ready to move  on. The move essentially divided the group.  In some ways it seemed there was a positive  outcome to the break. The remaining collective was more solidified and perhaps more  committed to a common goal. The move also  brought drastic improvements in physical  health—amazing what a little sun and dryness can do. Questions of business, politics, equipment, money and sheer energy  were being addressed in much the same way  they are today.  It is not a well-known fact that, until  very recently, Press Gang was the only  women's printshop in English Canada.  16    Kinesis October TO While there are women's publishing operations scattered around the country, women's  printshops are virtually unheard of. Networking with other women printers in Canada  has therefore been limited and so most of  the resource-sharing has come from experiences with women's groups and conferences  in the United States. It was a high experience for the women at Press Gang to attend  the first Northwest Women in Print Conference in Seattle in 1983. We made many personal, political and trade connections. The  conferences covered both printing and pub±  lishing.  By 1985, at the most recent National Conference on Women in Print, held in San  Francisco, the printing aspects.of the conferences was being minimized. Marilyn  Fuchs was one of the Press's representatives at the conference: "I think there was  a definite tension and uncomfortableness  around that for printers. We felt a little  isolated and apart from the rest of the  Conference."  But printers consolidated and made connections and the after-hours chats were  really worthwile. Still, there was a perceived shift away from the political in  publishing as well, and somehow the discussion of the importance of having-women's  printshops was missing.  Apart from this, the conference was very  useful. There were workshops day and  night on many aspects of printing and publishing and Press Gang itself gave a workshop on "Printers Staying Solvent" (pun  probably intended). The special affinity  we feel with the San Francisco Women's  Press was reinforced. Their recent move  to unionize inspired us to take the issue  in hand as well.  It feels like there's only a handful of us left. I think  we have to be vigilant to protect what we have.  With a move away from the political and  the difficult reality of staying alive in  a competitive business like printing  there is naturally a fear for the future  of alternative printshops. At the conference in San Francisco a woman representing  Workshop Printers in Seattle talked about  the group's precarious position. By the  summer of the next year, Workshop Printers went under. Several months ago we  got word that Iowa City Women's Press had  folded.  Marilyn explains why this news was so  devastating: "Iowa City was such a pillar.  The fact that they're gone is very disturbing and very sad. They were also the driving force behind the Women Printers Newsletter, put out by the Alliance of Les^  bian and Feminist Printers. Now that's  gone too. It feels like there's only a  handful of us left. I think we have to be  vigilant to protect what we have. People  tend to take us for granted, thinking we  have things we don't really have, that  we'll somehow survive. There's a feeling  that we'll always be here. We might not  be."  It is partly that reality that keeps Press  Gang moving and continuing to integrate  the personal and political with the financial. From the wageless days of burning  desire, when there was no' question that  you'd go into the Press in the middle of  the night to print an imperative leaflet,  to todays worker-contract, there has been  an unquestionable evolution at Press Gang.  The worker-contract has been in place for  a year now. It is a product of personal  and political struggles.  We have taken the ideas of those who,  years back, first pushed discussions of  having better working conditions and wages,  often taking great personal risk to do so.  We have shaped them into something that  recognizes the possibilities of integrating worker politics with those that Press  Gang grew from and with. It meant acknowledging that we are both workers and management. It also meant taking ourselves  seriously as workers. It may seem obvious,  but in the context of Press Gang's history, it was a remarkable and inspiring  revelation.  Paula Clancy is one of the women at the  Press who is in the unique position of working at Press Gang for four years, leaving,  and returning a year later. The year away  at a non-union, mainstream printshop opened her eyes to the issues of labour politics. She turned back to Press Gang with  a firm belief that worker issues could be  connected with what we had as a collective:  "It was really insightful to see the need  to make a decent wage in a larger political context. It's easier and more accurate,  I think, to take the issue away from individual needs for money, which leaves you  alone, to a political level that provides  a group and relationship within which to  work."  There are many progressive elements, even  by labour, standards, to the contract we  have made for ourselves, particularly relating to maternity leave, sick leave and  holidays. There is a structure in place  for continual wage increases.  Paula's history with the Press allowed her  to see the impact of the contract. "It  helped us to see what we had built and  claim the value of it. There had  been a  real effort to improve working conditions,  without spending money. That's ridiculous.  With the overtime issue, for example, the  motivation was a desire to recognize it;  the reform was taking it in time-off; the  revolution was taking in money."  The working out of the contract has not  always been easy, but for the most part  there's a sense of its importance. Paula  adds: "When you think about it, considering that we were women working in non-  traditional jobs, with no role models,  little experience or training, no money and  in a competitive business, the fact that we  exist at all is incredible."  It meant acknowledging that we are both workers  and management. It also meant taking ourselves  seriously at, workers.  But exist we do and much of the original  vision of Press Gang remains with us today.  Community connection continues to be an  important part of who we are. We set this  up in a couple ways. One way is how we  deal with customers. There is always information-sharing happening. It is part of our  daily work to explain and advise on printing jobs. This idea comes into sharp focus  when working with groups or individuals who  have a thin budget.  Our layout and bindery equipment is available to those looking to save money or  wanting a little independence. And we offer  donations to groups who otherwise would be  unable to get something printed. Another  way we connect in the community is through  our volunteer program. We believe that it  is important for women to have access to  the skills and knowledge of the printing  trade.  Press Gang has printing policies around  what we will not print. It is part of our  commitment to progressive change and to the  political community. Our general policy  states that we won't print anything that is  racist, sexist or homophobic. We develop  other, more specific, policies as issues  come up.  As workers in the graphic arts industry we  are keenly aware of the power of the printed word. We are here to challenge and to  create alternatives. And we have a desire  as workers to have control over our lives.  The noise of the presses is rarely heard  late at night anymore, but there is an  echo—freedom of the press belongs to  those who own the  October TO Kinesis    17 Disabled women and sex  4We have successes and failures'  The sex supplement  I This month Kinesis takes on sex and sexuality. "And it's about time,"  ! regular readers might add. It's true, this supplement has been a long time  p! coming, first announced overa year ago, and postponed at least three times  [ i since then.  So here it is, finally. Not definitive, complete, or the last word, but a range  ! of articles, stories, photos and graphics that we hope will spark debate and  i response, at least some of which will make its way back to us.  ! Sex is a big topic. The diversity of concerns it raises is enough to make it a  difficult subject to cover, even without the attendant fear and personal  i judgement. This diversity has meant that we've had to make some rather  I painful editorial decisions. Every reader will find something missing. We nope  i some, or better yet—lots, of you will fill those gaps in future issues.  We have chosen a particular perspective in order in order to make the topic  I more manageable—a perspective we have managed to maintain to varying  degrees. We have tried as much as possible to focus on sex, rather than the  j more nebulous 'lifestyle' issues around it.  I This is also no analysis of pornography in this supplement, or of sexual  i violence. These are not trivial issues. Nor are they unrelated to sex and  : sexuality. However, Kinesis has provided extensive ongoing coverage of pom,  | rape, incest and wife battering and their impact on women's lives, sexual and  : otherwise. Sex without violence has less frequently been broached. We try to  do that here.  i Lesbian sado-masochism is not analyzed in this issue either. We encourage  discussion on s/m from ail points of view, but are not interested in fuelling an  already polarized debate.

J  by Susan Martin and the women of DAWN  Recognition of sexuality doesn't necessarily imply sex. Sexual acknowledgement is  basic to building a relationship.  When  sexual identity has escaped you the option  ! isn't opened.  My disability is in proportion to how people  see me as asexual.  The problems of sexuality for disabled.'women  are the same as for able-bodied women, and  then some.  Those who have mobility problems, movement  disorders, blindness, speech difficulties  and who often need metal and plastic aids  for their bodies inspire fear and discomfort  in those who see them. People wonder—"do  they do it? Do they want to?" Well they do.  There are also those who appear normal but  who bring to their beds pain or fatigue.  Nerve dysfunction can cause the vagina to  not respond fully or to necessitate taping  a catheter out of the way.  Facing the presumptions of others or the  betrayal of your own body brings a profound  sense of loss. Not surprisingly the psychological consequences can end up being more  destructive to a woman's feelings of sexuality than her disability. Isolation may  be the only .thing embracing her as she  tries to surmount these difficulties..  Then there are the fundamental problems of  access—not just to discos but also restaurants, churches, friends' homes and so on.  If you can't get to another person then  you can't have a relationship.  Able-bodied women are disabled also as  far as sexuality goes. We all suffer  because of body-beautiful images of women  and the imposition of ideas about even  what our own feelings and self-image  should be.  I have multiple sclerosis, which, as a  nerve disease creates symptoms (often  temporary) that affect my sexuality as  well as my ability to walk. I am also a  member of DAWN (DisAbled Women's Network  of BC) which held its founding conference  last March. From the proceedings I will  quote statements from those women who participated in a workshop on sexuality which  was the largest held during the conference.  Lust is a four letter word  by Cy-Thea Sand  A couple of years ago I ended up in an all  night conversation with six other lesbians  on a dock facing the Richelieu river  Quebec. We were all participants in the  Feminist Periodicals Conference and we had  gravitated towards each other with the  intensity of new lovers.  We talked relationships and sex all night  and the recurring theme was for better  sex and more satisfying relationships. We  demystified lust by speaking openly about  its role in our lives.  We carried the conversation into directions  few of us had walked before, but in the  end we returned to our individual lives  where the most profound questioning begins.  How important is lust in my life? How  is it connected to or  different from creative energy? Do I feel lonely or sexual  and what is the difference? Will learning  how to cruise successfully really enhance  I my self-esteem or is good sex not really  I what I need right now; do I control lust?  I or does it control me and how do circum-  I  stances alter my response? What is my  I  sexual history to date and how do I want  I  to change or improve it?  I When I came out in the early seventies,  I groups of women were not speaking about  I the nitty-gritty of getting it on. In  I political groups we were defining the  I oppression of lesbians, struggling to  I articulate ourselves in feminist arenas.  I Lust, as an integral part of our lives  I as lesbians, was seldom if ever on that  j historical agenda.  18   Kinesis October TO  The recent sex debates have tended to  focus on anti and pro pornography positions, vanilla versus s/m sexual techniques and lesbian role playing. My con*  cern is that the conversation is ending in  prescription.  In the seventies, many women felt that the.  only way to be a true feminist was to sleep  with women. I now sense a pressure for  real  lesbians to be sexual dynamos, uninhibited amazons forever searching for the  ultimate sexual high. While lust as a public subject is extremely important for  women—when they are doing the talking,  that is—the private, complex, personal  nature of the topic may be getting lost.  In her article Lust Is A Four Letter Word  (Heresies #12), J. Lee Lehman writes that  "all the romance in the world cannot hide  the fact that good sex is an intense form  nication."  Audre Lorde's definition of the erotic  as "a measure between the beginning of our  sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings" hints at the import of our  subject."  Some of us lose the feeling and long for  its return; other women wish that lust between women would just go away leaving  them in peace. Lust can upset us, limit  us, make us crazy and angry or limit our  autonomy. It can make us powerful or vulnerable, pulsating through our daily lives  and dreams like electricity in a conduit.  Lust needs to be better understood.  Many of us don't understand lust and its  power because it has been defined for us.  Men lust. Women are taught coy ways of  controlling that lust until the circum  stances are right—being in love or getting  married. Our own.desires must be subverted  in this game as well as our access to  knowledge about its impulse. Lust is put  on hold until we go wild in the marriage  bed or lie still until it's all mercifully  over, our sensuality corseted and eventually repressed altogether.  We have been taught to fear and control  the lust of others and in the process we  have been denied the profound experience  of directing our desire and the sex act  itself. Much of what sex radicals are  writing about is just this: women demand  ing to speak publicly of desire, of organizing the conversation around the managing  of the give and take of sexual pleasure.  The fact that many of us stutter at the  very thought of such deliberateness is  reflected in the romantic swoon many women  fall into when they feel hot for someone  and in the glazed eyes of women who can  only flirt when alcohol or drugs are loosening their minds and other parts of their  anatomy.  A woman recently spoke to me about her  reaction when she spots a woman who really  .Women shared many details of their personal lives on a woman to woman basis, with  non-disabled women participating.  "As my disability becomes more visible, I  am treated more and more as asexual, and  I start treating myself that way. This is  a real personal loss."  "I have a fear of being seen as grotesque."  "These are the images that are reflected  onto us. It is not in good taste to have  sexual feelings; it is not your place to  be seductive, or even project yourself as  having a good-time."  "Models in a Hollywood catalogue don't  look like us."  "I am able-bodied and I had an affair with  a quad. He wanted to be seen as equal but  also wanted me to feel sorry for him."  "It is confusing inside. We feel we are  just like you but society says no'; there  are two sides, they come out at different  times."  Growing up and learning about sexuality is  difficult for any of us. Dealing with being  single for a disabled person is even more  daunting. For even a 'normal'-appearing  person, imagine announcing to a prospective  partner that you can't do it quite like  everyone else they have met. Imagine as  well the difficulties for a disabled lesbian whose sources of shared understanding  are even further limited.  Marriage doesn't offer uncomplicated solutions. Studies differ as to whether marriages of those with chronic diseases or  disabilities suffer divorce more frequently than the general population. A woman,  however, is less likely to live with a'  supportive man than vice versa and is even  more economically vulnerable than most  women.  There are problems surrounding issues of  birth control and child-rearing which are  excites her: she freezes, refuses to return the woman's look overcome by the power  of her erotic response. She moves as far  away as possible from the dynamo and ends  up going home alone and frustrated.  No wonder many lesbians have drinking problems or are involved with women who do.  Alcohol has given us permission to explore  dangerous territory, sexual territory,  which explodes with passion, confusipn,  pain and despair. Suddenly we are actors in  our own plays. The script can' be dictated  by us but instead we often stumble around  hurting others and ourselves in attempts  at erotic autonomy.  I want to know what lust is. I wasn't  allowed to be lustful while I was a kid or  an adolescent. As I grew older I learned  that there are socially sanctioned ways for  women to be sexual adults in the world. We  know that these sanctions have nothing to  do with women's liberation.  Many women spend energy, time and money  trying to get in touch with their anger but  I have heard of few women in therapy who  get in touch with their erotic potential.  I have heard of few women in therapy  I who want to get in touch with their  erotic potential.  In it's supression, lust is in many ways  akin to women's anger. The angry outbursts  of my youth made my parents as uncomfortable  as their fears that I was sexually active.  There are lady-like ways of being pissed  off.  I experience both these emotions, lust and  anger, as avenues to either being in control of my world or being overwhelmed by it  all; overwhelmed and coerced—often by my  own inexperience and fears—into silence,  resentment and mistakes. Lust may be con-  aspects of any woman's sexuality but again  are complicated by a physical condition.  The supportive partner faces stresses of  their own with little outside support and  understanding.  "Disabled men have problems with sexuality  too. Except it is men who traditionally do  the approaching, so we have two counts  against us, inhibiting our sexuality possibilities. And because of sexual roles we  are supposed to be sex objects, alluring."  "Wheelchair dancing".  "Dancing seductively in a wheelchair? Why  not? I had an incredible time at the BC  Games dancing. It's hard when you're the  only wheelchair person on the floor. But  having a good time shows; I started perceiving admiring glances. The energy has to  come from within."  "The dance issue is very tricky for me. It  makes me uncomfortable. I love music but  I need quiet. -Dancing is the wrong thing  for me. What else is there besides dancing?"  "In January I went to a dinner/dance for  professional women. I had a good time and  was even invited out for dinner the next  week, but I didn't dance because for me  dancing is very painful. As we were going  home my friend said "why bother if you  don't dance?" This kind of lack of understanding really hurts. Lack of understanding, or lack of accessibility always brings  inequality back into the relationship."  "How do you make people reflect on you as  a sexual person?"  We discussed trianing workshops,  confidence and tools for social success.  Perhaps a booklet—Sexuality for the Disabled: A How To.  Bath, candlelight, wine.  Appreciating our bodies for what they  really are—learning to love what we have.  Appreciating one's own worth. There is  a  relationship between sexuality and assertiveness .  Disabled women and sex continued page 26  nected with anger. Whether it is and how  is just one of the many questions that  I believe must be considered if we are to  take, as Lorde says, "a measure...between  our sense of self and the chaos of our  strongest feelings."  I don't want our questions short-circuited  or undermined in a frantic unwise attempt  to fill in the silences of decades.  The questions we need to ask are as varied  and individual as the women who comprise  our communities. I don't want our questions  short-circuited or  undermined in a frantic,  unwise attempt to fill in the silences of  decades.  Lust is being explored publicly and privately in our communities. We need to remember  that the bottom line in this "speaking sex"  exercise should be women's increased inde--  pendance and sense of worth. To this end  we have to take responsibility for the content of our desires and step by self-defined  step give them life. In this process there.  will be a diversity of sexual language, a  diversity which should excite us and also  enable us to promote tolerance and respect  even as we speak in different languages.  Cy-Thea Sand is a guest editor on the  Fireweed collective for their upcoming  issue on CLASS. She would be interested  to hear from anyone who has thought  about class issues around sexuality and/or  relationships. She knows that there are  many lesbians in Vancouver in mixed class  relationships and would like articles,  fiction or poetry on how different class  backgrounds impact on the sexual and  domestic aspects of these relationships.

A series of conferences and controversies,  beginning at the start of this decade in  the U.S. and meshed, both south of the border and here, with conflict around strategies against pornographic imagery and writing has produced The Great Sex Debate. A  debate that still confounds a lot of feminists.   ?%ii.';J*j'£-  The Heresies  Sex issue published in 1981 and  Barnard Conference on Sexuality, also in  1981 in New York, marked a major shift, for  feminism on this continent, a shift towards  a focus on sex itself. Both aired concerns  (among them sado/masochism and butch/femme  role playing) that had been largely ignored  or taboo, at least for political women.  These "events" were not, however, the first  feminist discussions or writings on sex and  sexual practice. Predecessors that leap to  mind are Our Bodies Ourselves,  Betty Dodson's  Liberating Masturbation,   Pat Califia's  Sapphistry... and the list goes on.  What makes today's sex debates different is  their theoretical intensity, lust and sex  have been catapulted out of the bedrooms  and onto the conference platform. This new  level of interest began in the early 80's,  true enough, but the groundwork was laid  Loving your enemy  in the 70's, by the movment against violence  • against women; by lesbian feminism and  gay liberation; by anti-porn activism and  the anti-censorship response. When we talk  about sex today, we are questioning in a  profoundly new way, informed by a hard  earned picture of the factors affecting  women's lives in North America.  The sex debates have forced the fleshing  out of political positions that had been  living in an uneasy alliance.. The two main,  or at least most polarized, elements in the  debate have been the sex radicals and the  anti-porn feminists. Public conflicts between anti-porn groups and such groups as  s/m feminists go back as far as the late  Tough choices and hard contradictions  by Veneita Porter  I spent almost an hour on the phone with  Allen tonight talking about all the horrible shit that happens to black folks. Fear  not, this wasn't a simple diatribe on living in a fetid white society because the  blood be hurtin the blood as well. I felt  my consciousness start to submerge when we  started talking about the Atlanta child  murders. Inside, part of me understands  that if I were ever to release my rage at  what happens to us, my world as I know it  would quite simply be destroyed.  In the same stream of thought I fantasize  about what I'd like to do with a very hot  anglo who comes in to proofread on Thursdays. Part of me wants to hug her tightly,  to feel the imprint of her breasts against  mine, but some part of me wants all of them  to pay...  There is always the possibility of slavery.  Where is the comfortable place between rage  pain and pleasure? Is it tha"E moment right  before you scream with release? Is that  the place where we have no colour?  It has always been difficult to explain,  nay, difficult to understand, my black  Indian's feelings that tear me apart make  me self-destruct on a regular basis. No  one has ever showed me how to use this internal fire so that I do not burn myself  or others. There is a lot of street stuff  that says, "You can never trust a white one.  They are soulless." So in spite of the  part that loves, there is always a need to  test, to push and to see how far the limit  of "love" goes.  There is a sense of both triumph and embar-  assment in being with a white lover. The  triumph is about feeling like you came a  long distance to get to this place together. All that "two worlds" shit. Part of  me knows that raised poor or working class  is a common bond that goes deeper than  skin. Yet fingers tongues cocks and cunts  don't ask for ethnic credentials when they  are warm wet and hard...so much for politics.  I never fantasize about strangers. It's  not safe. There is an element of known quality in my fantasies. The curve of a lip,  the hollow of a collarbone, perhaps the  memory of a kiss, are all interwoven to  create a breathless place in my mind. In  this place, anglos are always there to do my  my bidding completely and unquestioningly.  Their only desire is me! I don't have to  think about whether they're comfortable  kneeling.  In my real world, I'm often the giver,  the provider, so willing to guide someone  through to a place of passion but with a  reluctance to escape with them. To get beyond an adversary relationship one has to  fall in love with the enemy. I don't mean  story-book material, just every-working-  day love. I've got there with friends, but  whenever there are periods of mis or non  communication, I start to wonder. It's  hard not to feel a victim to your colour.  Not to wear it like a shield telling all  to keep back. But we pay. I pay inside for  all that dynamite unfused.  I look at flowers growing in the cracks of  the sidewalk, bravely showing their colours  and sometimes I say to myself, "If they can  do it, I sure ain't got nothing to complain  about." Living in a city like Boston one  has to develop a healthy fear of everyday  racism. So much fucking water off my back.  Sometimes I just want .to rip them limb fromi  limb. It's hard not to carry that kind of  garbage into a relationship. A lot of them  haven't survived. My pain over those doesn't  leave.  It's sort of two-steps-forward-one-step-  back' process, the black and white thing, you  know? I know self-pride is the center where  we must begin. No one helps a victim, just  chastises. Developing our fantasies to the  point of reality is essential for me because the subconscious tells me things  I need to listen to. Approaching people is  not easy. But what is? Let's be serious.  There are people you and I want in our  lives. Fall in love with an enemy. There's  a possibility of slavery. There's a possibility of freedom.  Reprinted from Bad Attitude,  Winter 1985.

One the one hand, anti-porn activists called some women's sexual practices  oppressive and anti-feminist, personalizing  the debate to the.point of calling s/m lesbians 'diseased' and excluding specific  women from ant'i-porn conferences. On the  other hand, s/m lesbians charged the anti-  porn movement with being misinformed and  ill-prepared, and eventually began to label it regressive, moralistic and anti-  Samois' basic position in this debate,  that women have a right to do what gives  them pleasure, is better slated in more  consciously sex radical writing—by such  women as Gayle Rubin, Pat Califia, Cindy  Patton, Joan Nestle, Sue Golding and  Amber Hollibaugh. It is not an argument  for s/m per se, but rather an analysis  that begins in a very different place from  previous feminist analysis. Sexual practise and the repression of alternative  sexualities is the issue here.  Rubin outlines a sexual hierarchy created  by this repression that she believes is,  ultimately, detrimental to all of us.  White heterosexual males are at the top  of this seale, lesbians and gay men are on  the low end but at the bottom are 'deviant', 'kinky' lesbians and gays—s/m  dykes, butch/femme'couples, transvestites,  fetishists—. According to Rubin and  others, by stigmatizing certain fringe  sexual elements as anti-woman, some feminists are simply buying into the hierarchy, opting for the small amount of  power they can have by being slightly  higher on the scale.  The anti-porn activist's perspective, at  least as expressed by Andrea Dworkin and  Catherine McKinnon, also puts the repression of sexuality at the centre. But this  time it's the subjugation of women's sexuality by various patriarchal means, which  has as it's goal the oppression of women.  Porn, sexual violence, and such sexually  defined roles as wife and prostitute, are  "  part of this subjugation. ^  Sexual practice is looked at not in terms gj  of its deviance from a white heterosexual ■£  male norm but rather is analysed as an I  agent of sexist repression. Anti-porn E  activists, of course, range from right j=  wing women who are concerned about the s-  sanctity of the family and deny that women %  are oppressed, to feminists who are pro-  sex but also pro-legislation. Some women  are anti-porn and anti-censorship. In the  debate mentioned above, several women were  (and are) members of both WAVPM and Samois.  Similarly, the women who have been called  sex radicals encompass a wide range of  political vi'ews.  Political perspectives obviously affect  where individual women fit in on the sex  issue. But it is not inaccurate, to say that  that the public debate so far has been primarily between women who feel confident in  saying that"some sexual practices, and  images of them reinforce oppression and  should be organized against, and those who  find that confidence simplistic and moralistic.  And the controversy has raged: should s/m  women be allowed at women's festivals?  Should women's bookstores carry the new  lesbian sex magazines? Is butch/femme an  element of lesbian culture or internalized  oppression? Is there such a thing as politically correct sex? Who should be allowed  to speak at what conference and so on.  As well, over the years this fundamental  debate has, of necessity, opened other  The debate has been  between women who  think some sexual  practices should be  organized against,  and those who find  thatsimplistic  and moralistic.  questions and many different groups have  been coming up with answers.  In Eastern  Canada,  for instance, workers in the sex  industry—porn actresses,  prostitutes,  strippers—have increasingly begun to contribute to feminist's analysis of their  work.  Prostitutes are demanding support  in organizing for better working conditions,  and deny that they can be defined as victims . Sex trade workers involvement in  the debate is raising yet new questions  on the interaction of economics and sex.  If women get control over their working  lives will the sex industry cease to be  exploitative? Even if the sex industry  stops being sexist,  doesn't that still  make it a capitalist institution? Can sex  be commoditized?  Obviously sex can be commoditized, it is  all the time, increasingly so. What is  interesting is that though porn is often  seen as commoditization, much, of the discussion on sexual freedom itself ignores  the issue of the sheer commoditization of  all sex,  and whether it is desireable. When  the issue of sexual freedom is debated on  it's own terms,  as the freedom to do what  we want,  the operative issue is often the  accessibility of sexual materials—media,  toys,  and eventually people.  The lesbian  sex culture in San Francisco,  for example,  now has a strong economic base, with lesbian prostitutes,  leather shops,  sexual  counsellors,   strip joints,  and so on. We  may agree that this is alright,  that women  have a right to be paid for their work.  But is it sexual freedom,  or just the freedom to buy our kind of sex too?  In her talk at the same Heat Is On conference last year,   local activist Sara Diamond  outlined the range of positions in the sex  debate. She paraphrased an analysis that she  calls  "sex as ideological battleground."  Developed by such thinkers as the French  philosopher, Michel Foucault,  this theory  extends the connection between sexual practice and our place in society beyond "porn  is the theory,  rape is the practice," and  says that all sexual practice is socially .  determined,  by a wide range of factors. For  any given person,  or practice,  a number of  these factors may come together.  Class,  race  gender,  sexual orientation,  the nature of  the government in power,  each contributes.  In looking at sex,  we have to unravel the  impact of each one in the appropriate context.  "There tends to be this idea of sexual liberation that doesn't have meaning," says  Pat Feindel,  formerly an. anti-porn activist.  "If it means you can get sex at any old  corner store,   it doesn't mean much. Freeing  sex up from the whole marketplace,  that  might mean something.  If it's free,  it's  not sold."  With an increasingly strong right-wing  drive on the move in Canada,  it seems imperative that feminists come to some sort of  consensus on the sex issue. A key component  of right wing misogeny and homophobia is  that it's anti-sex.  Certainly anti-sex-  without-marriage-or-reproduction. Feminists,  with few exceptions,  are pro-sex. We all  agree that women should not be limited to  sexual activity for reproduction only. How  can we expand the terrain of common ground?  For one thing,  we need to work at taking  sex out of the judgment and morality laden  context it now occupies. We also need to  begin to talk about what we like as much  as what we don't like.  We'll give the last word to Pat Fiendel:  "We have to get beyond sexual violence to  deal with the right wing approach to sex.  Because they are talking about sex, not  about how we have been abused. And sex is  here to stay. Neither the right wing nor  feminists can do anything about that."

Who we choose to have  sex with, and how, is central to how we see  ourselves for ourselves and in the world.  Kinesis  held conversations with two women  who agreed to speak out- of what is all too  often a silent discourse. How do power relationships work in sex between men and  women? Is there" something we can call heterosexual sex? Does the act name itself  one way or the other? What do women like  and dislike about sex with men?  The following passages are only a place to  begin a longer 'and more complex discussion,  but this can only be advanced if we confront  what women themselves say and have said  about sex.  Liz: Well, I almost always want more fore-  play than men do. When I say that I mean, I  haven't had a particular problem with premature ejaculation or whatever, where they  just can't wait and it just happens and I  have had relationships with men where they  have been quite happy to take a very long  time. But I like a slower build-up.  That's where I've often found it difficult  with men. I always, and this is my own  particular sexual psyche, I like a long  seduction process. I know that's not true  for all women, and it's certainly not something that's particular to male psyches.  They may like to be seduced but it's not a  long seduction process. I like the idea of  being able to show the person what it is,  step by step, the kinds of ways you want it  men could, with their fingers, touch me very^  very well around the clitoris. Occasionally it's been good but that's rare. In  terms of oral sex, too, I've constantly had  to say you know..."You've got to go lighter."  Jeanne:  Often I find when it's not really  satisfying, it does seem to be when it's  with men who are quite penis-centred. I  like to kiss a lot. Usually I think this  kind of penis-centred stuff is with men who  aren't really competent. Either they haven't  taken the time to learn or they're too  goal-oriented as if the male orgasm was  all that mattered, and the getting there  isn't important, it's just the goal. I  don't think that's necessarily satisfying  for either. •  What kinds of social pressures or dynamics  have you perceived as affecting the way  you relate to men or'they relate to you  sexually?  Jeanne:  I've been called over-sexed by a  couple of men, and it's like "Oh, you're  always ready, don't you ever say no?" Somebody was once fondling me for a while and  then said, "You're always lubricated" and  I said, "Well I'm human, right? You've  been stroking me for a while, what do you  expect?" I think some men are threatened  by that. They're actually frightened by  it, if your desire is very strong. Not  all men but some. And then you feel really  put down and hurt. I suppose it has to do  with the general insults you hear about  ways  you want it to be done really slowly.  women in literature. "Oh, you're like a  cat in heat." And that sort of thing. I  think there is a myth of uncontrollable  female sexuality that some men find frightening.  Liz:  I think it's really difficult for men  to get into being sexy about their bodies.  If I'm making love and I'm on top, which  is my favourite position usually, I like  how my breasts are, I like how my body  is and I get into being sort of brazen  about it, or whatever. And they like it  and I like it.  But men don't get into being tha.t way about  to be done really slowly. I like to be built their own bodies very much. They're not  up like that to the edge and be kept on the  edge for a really long time.  I haven't had that with women either, so I  don't identify it as a particularly heterosexual problem, although I guess I tend to  think of it that way just because I think  of men as being more goal-oriented.  Secondly, it's fine with me at times to  feel sensual and a bit sexual not to come.  Say late at night if I'm tired, I like to  touch and have some sexual feelings but I  don't really want to go all the way. Whereas in my experience with men, once they  get going, they have to complete it at  some point.  Another thing is I don't think I've found  very many relationships where I felt that  22 Kinesis October ^  allowed, because men are not the object of  the gaze, they therefore don't allow themselves to be  that to themselves either. So  their sexuality is a lot more repressed  in that sense. I like seeing a man lying  on a bed touching himself. I think that's  great. I love to watch men doing that. .  I like to watch women doing that, it's  not a distinction that I make, I just think  that's nice, and I wish more men got into  their bodies that way. That's one of the  things I like about a lot of gay men is  that yeah, they're more into themselves  as sexual beings.  What about looking and being looked at  while you 're having sex?  Jeanne:  Yes I like to look. I mean I've  often thought I must be superficial because  I do like to look at people that I find  physically attractive. I mean, maybe it's  only me that finds them attractive, but  yes, I like looking at mouths a lot and  eyes and I like bodies. I like to look at  legs and penises too. In a lot of ways it's  curiousity; there's such a variety.  If I feel secure I like to be looked at.  I often don't feel secure. I'm only very  recently learning not to get that feeling  of "stop it! because you're going to find  all the flaws"...and realize that they're  not gazing at you for that, but because  they like what they see. If you're very  self-conscious that ruins a lot of enjoyment.  I remember one relationship I had where the  man used to like to watch as he entered.  That usually wouldn't be the conventional  missionary position, but kneeling or standing or something, and then I started to and,  yeah, it's really exciting because then  you've got sight and feeling all mingling  in together.  What do you like about penetration—what  has your experience been?   -  Jeanne:  It's like total bodily contact. But  it depends on the mood. Sometimes I like  it because it can be really tender and gentle and loving, but other times I like it  sort of harder. When that happens it usually  then a very active encounter, not just lying around and wumpf wumpf it's over;  there's a lot of rolling around and moving.  When I get a big surge of desire (for penetration) I don't exactly know what the  physical mechanism is that happens, but I  always feel that my womb drops, there's this  real tightening and then a dropping and I  feel it. And my vaginal muscles flex by •  themselves...I don't do it. they do, and I  get lubricated. And so there's a lot of  sensation for me in my vagina and it seems  to want something there. Now I don't know  if that's because of everything I've read  that says that's what it is, or if it's  simply the feeling. I don't know why, but I  do want something there.  But because of a number  of factors « sexual  relationships I've had, and  the women's movement  — I got more confident.  Liz:  When I was first getting into sex, I  think we all learned the missionary position  first before we learned everything else.  But because of a number of factors—sexual  relationships I'd had, and the women's  movement, everything that was changing and  making me think about my sexuality...1 got  more confident. I became more interested in  finding out how to get as much pleasure  out of it as I could, and I found that  being on top of a man was a lot more satisfying than being on the bottom because I had  more control...over my vaginal muscles and  also because I can be touched. |  relationships  and men  Sometimes I like it when they're on top and  from behind...it's partly because I like  my bum being touched, but also there's a  certain way in which that's just kind of  fucking and I like that feeling of being  fucked if I've got enough control. I never  like just being fucked in the sense that I  don't move...because I never come that way;  I have to be able to get my own muscle  movement going.  What about oral sex and touching with men?  Jeanne:  When I first learned and started  to do oral sex I found it difficult. I  But then I've had others (relationships) where men have  been pretty good good even if they do feel goal oriented.  They're still there to hug.      And especially afterwords.  men and women. But most of the time I don't  feel guilty about those because I think you  work with the material you were given as you  grow. And it will be other generations  where women are raised in really different  ways that will begin to change those things.  those things.  What about the surrender of power in sex  with men?  Liz: In terms of role stuff, some of the  most exciting things for me can be when  I'll play either of the extremes where he  kept gagging and thought I wasn't doing it  right and that was one of the reasons why  initially I didn't like it. I felt that I  wasn't good a.t it. I felt—"I can't do this  And then with people who are sensitive to  you...they'll sort of help you or say it's  okay don't worry...or you can do this or...  I like that, it feels great...or mind  your teeth (laughs).  Liz:  I like oral sex plenty. Now I've had  relationships with men where they were just  totally hopeless in terms of oral sex and  then I don't really like it because if  they don't know how to do it, it's just a  drag. But I've also had relationships with  men who have been, I think, consummate  artists and that's helped me explore orgasmic potential.  Sometimes with my current relationship,  sometimes he's on and sometimes he's not on.  When they're not on I get frustrated, I  think..."Why can't they understand, why  can't they know...why can't you tell what  my response is?"...and so I try to explain...  What about the role of fantasy in your sexuality?  Jeanne:  I don't fantasize during sex usually. Mostly when I masturbate, I do. I'm not  proud of my fantasies so I find them very  difficult to talk about. They mostly have to  do with situations where the power of my  desire will lead me into having sex with  people whom I normally would have nothing  to do with...and it's not the man's control  over me, it's my own sexual urges overcoming  me and leading me into situations that I  realistically wouldn't want to be in.  Liz:   I had a rape fantasy...when I first  got into the women's movement I thought,  "oh god, why do I have this?" Well I don't  feel that at all anymore...it didn't take  me long to realize that I didn't have any  desire to be raped at all. I thought, "How  would I feel if I was raped?" and I concluded that I'd feel terrible. I wouldn't be  turned on at all." So it's not the physical  act...it's the combination of not having  any control in the situation which has the  flip side of not letting go of control.  That's part of it. The other one is being  desired so much that you're absolutely  irresistible  I don't consider those to be ultimate sexual psychic feelings. I think there are  others that would be more growing for peo-  ple...feelings that would take them further...  says "Ok, I want to be completely dominated  tonight" and I just get to do whatever I  want and I'll take him to the edge and I'll  '•let it go'down again and I'll take him to  the edge and keep doing it and I get very  excited by that...or the other way around..  I like to have my hands tied up, or my  legs...not that I do it very often, but I  like it because I'm not convinced there's  anything wrong with it at all. I like it  because it's a way of completely giving  over the power which is of course what I'm  doing, and then I can get completely into  letting go...it helps me let go...and for  someone like me control is pretty strong,  but I can identify with both positions.  What sort of comfort and personal reaffirmation have you experienced in sexual relationships with  Jeanne:  Some men have been able to express  their tenderness equally, not all but  some...there's just little gestures like  the way they touch you when it's finished,  or when you say goodbye and they stroke  your face. Some men are very tender. I  sometimes think my need for these gestures  is an indication of a certain dependence.  You don't just want to have been a body,  or what, (when I'm feeling really cynical)  I've called a sperm recepticle. I mean  you want to feel that there's something  else as well, and usually the tenderness  comes when there is a pleasure in each  other as people.  Liz:  I've had all kinds of sexual connections with men ranging from ones that I've  felt really rotten about, to ones where  the next day I just wished it had never  happened, through relationships that I've  had where it didn't feel like the men were,  very much there either—before or after  their own particular goal satisfaction.  . But then I've had others where men have  been pretty good even if they do feel  goal oriented. They're still there to hug.  And especially afterwards. But I would  think that the man who knows how to hug  well is the exception. But when I have had  it, it's been pretty well given, and in a  good spirit, meeting some of their needs too  and not just mine.  October ^6 Kinesis   23 T  -iW*L  W^  by Johanna Quakenbush, Sharon  Hounsell, and Wendy Frost  Wendy:  I think I would make a distinction  between defining myself as bisexual and  identifying as bisexual. To me the second  implies that there is actually a kind of  political movement or a publicly agreed  upon definition. I don't think that there  is an agreed upon definition within the  women's movement. With that distinction, I'  say I define myself as bisexual because  I feel sexually attracted toward both men  and women, and I feel like acting on both  of those attractions. I can't see defining  myself as either heterosexual or lesbian.  At the moment, I'm involved in a primary  relationship with a man and not with anyone  else. So I probably look  straight. People  I know may think I'm straight. People who  have seen me more involved with women probably think that I've now decided I'm  straight. I don't think of it that way. I  think that I've been bisexual for a long  time. Part of that time was spend wondering if I was actually a lesbian or thinking I was on my way to being a lesbian.  It's not that I rejected the possibility of  being in lesbian relationships. It's just  that I decided that what I am is bisexual;  whatever I'm doing, whoever I'm involved  with—that's the best description of my  sexuality.  Johanna:  I think of myself as bisexual because I have feelings for both men and  women in my sexuality and have acted upon  those feelings in the past. Whatever relationship I'm in, I don't consider I've  changed from the other side. I haven't  given up the love and feelings I have for  women if I'm with a man, or the love and  feeling I have for men if I'm with a  woman. It doesn't mean that I'm missing  something if I'm not with one or the other.  I'm very attracted to both sexes, and I  could never commit myself to saying that •  I was not going to be attracted to the  other sex and become exclusively hetero-  , sexual or lesbian.  Sharon:  For me it's simply that I can see .  myself in a relationship with either right  now and as a single person, I feel attractions to both-women and men and have fantasies involving men or women. In terms of  the distinction that Wendy spoke of, I  think that I do identity as bisexual. I  j do beg to differ. Part of that is wanting  there to be a visible political identification and coming out as bisexual. That's  really important to me.      5jfi&&'p  There are lesbian political events, organizations, spaces, etc. in which I don't  feel there's room for bisexual women. I  feel a lot of contradiction about that; on  the one hand I think that's perfectly  acceptable, that lesbians organize with  lesbians. I think that self-organization  | is a really important political principle.  Yet on the other hand, I think there is  some overlap between political concerns  of bisexual women and lesbians. Shouldn't  there be some political intersection?  Johanna:  For me visibility is a little bit  different because I'm not very active in  the lesbian community since I've been back  in Vancouver. It hasn't really drawn me to  it because I'm in a primary relationship  with a man.  I've felt hesitant because of the mixed  feelings that I get from the feminist  community about bisexuals. The feelings of  political lesbians and separatists make  me more reluctant to become involved in the  women's movment because somehow, as a bisexual, I feel that I have to justify my  sexuality before they even have a chance  to know me or to regard me as my own person.  Bisexuality: sexual definition  Right now I deal more' with the heterosexual  women. I find that bisexuality is rarely  even talked about in the heterosexual community. When I have talked about it with  friends who are heterosexual or with men  friends it's always looked upon as "okay".  It's actually pretty well accepted. I would  think some even think it's erotic, which  doesn't give me the feeling that they really understand. It gives me the feeling that  they think bisexuals are people who like to  dabble. There's no clear understanding of  bisexuals in the heterosexual community  either. Bisexual women are seen as straight,  but adventurous.  From Boaistuau's Histories Prodigeuses, Paris, 1573.  Sharon:  My experience was a lot different  from Johanna's although we both arrived in  Vancouver and started putting down roots  here about the same time. One of the first  things that I did, and certainly it's been  my primary focus, was to seek out the women's  community. I was really surprised to find  that I was feeling challenged. Not overtly.  It's not that anyone approached me and  started ranting and raving, in fact it was  very subtle. Somehow I felt that I had to  make a choice about whether I was lesbian  or heterosexual, which, when I examined it  I found that that was unrealistic. My choice  was that I was bisexual.  I felt challenged by a lot of politics that  I had never had direct contact with before;  basically regarding putting any amount of  energy into men. They were healthy challenges because they made me look at my own  heterosexism, my own homophobia, and made  me re-examine my choices. In the process  of doing that I grew more sure of myself as  a bisexual. I realized that it is important  that bisexual women be visible within the  women's community. I think that a lot of  women assume that I'm a lesbian. I find  myself in groups of women and somebody will  make a blanket statement like "all of us  dykes", and I feel like saying "excuse me,  but —". I feel that I'm having to fight  for visibility within the women's community  in the same way that lesbians have had to  fight for visibility. I expect them to  understand that. I expect recognition for  my own choice. I expect to be allowed to  make that choice.  Wendy:   I found similar things when I was  less primarily involved with a man and  more involved with women. I found with  lesbians who knew me that there was an  assumption—and I think I even had it myself—that I was an apprentice lesbian or  something, that I was on my way to being  a lesbian. As such I could be accepted  provisionally, as if to say, "she's probably going to turn out to be one of us,  eventually she'll get rid of this man and  really all it will take will be having  a successful relationship with a woman  and once she gets that she'll shed all  the rest of it."  Sharon:   I've run across that same attitude of bisexuality being a phase between  heterosexuality and lesbianism. I find  that attitude really patronizing. It  doesn't give me any credit for the choice  I'm making now. It says that the choice  I'm making is not quite legitimate. It  also says there's no halfway. It says  you're either straight or you're lesbian.  Wendy:  There's a sense of orthodoxy, of  correct line sexuality about the women's  movement. And feminism to me is much more  about rebellion—it's about not falling for  or into correct lines. I think the fact  that there has been a strong lesbian-feminist movement makes bisexuality more  possible than it was before. So they should  be seen as acting together, rather than  as acting in opposition.  Part of the strength of lesbian-feminism  has been the emphasis on woman-identification. But in terms of sexuality, what  I've found daunting is the sense that you  could only be a true and perfect feminist  if you were lesbian, and your sexual feelings for women could only be best and  truly expressed if you had nothing to do g  with men. I fincL&hat,attitude an. under--::  current of a lot of lesbian-feminist writing, but not often really clearly stated.  Sharon:  I want more than the right to be  bisexual. I want to be valued for my perspective as a bisexual. As a bisexual I  have some understanding of, what it is like  to be involved with a man and of what it  is to be involved with a woman, and it's  not everybody who has that perspective. It  has a-unique and important role in the  women's movement in terms of moving^discussion beyond the stuck place where we  are at in terms of our sexual politics.  i Until three years ago, I considered myself  ' heterosexual and most of my sexual relationships were with men. Then I started to  find myself being attracted to women. I  was involved in a friendship with a woman  which grew over the course of the summer,  to a point where I realized that the love  that I felt for her could be expressed  sexually. I grew to desire that although  I never acted on that. That whole process  really made me examine how I recognize  feelings of attraction. It happened so  differently than the attractions I'd felt  to men.  I began to look at my own conditioning in  terms of sexual attractions. I started to  recognize patterns. Working it out has  been good for me. I've unravelled some of  the conditioning and can now make more  honest choices about when to act on attrat-  ions. I'm attracted to people who are at  ease with themselves, at ease in their  own bodies, who move with a certain amount  of fluidity, who have a joy for life, who  laugh easily, who communicate well,  people with whom I share a political perspective or values.  Wendy:   I find that my attractions to men  and to women are really different. The  first time I felt sexually attracted to a  woman was very similar to what Sharon described; it grew out of a very close friend-  24   Kinesis October TO  or political identity?  ship. I came to realize that I was sexually  attracted to her, that I could feel sexual  toward a woman. In the course of realizing  that, I felt that I was expressing my sexuality in a more real way than I had before. I was feeling desire in myself for  someone else.  My attractions to men had been more based  on their desire in relation to me. I  don't think I had actually felt physical  lust for men. I was feeling this in relation to this woman. My feelings for women  are much more direct, in-the-body feelings.  My attraction to men is much more image-  based. It's about a tension between us,  often even a combativeness, like being  able to verbally duel. It's the tension  in the interplay that draws me to men.  With women it very much is physical attraction to their bodies.  Women's bodies answer something in my eroticism much more than men's bodies do. It  feels to me like my attractions to men are  a lot less healthy than my attractions to  women. I'm suspicious of that combativeness,  that tension; that attraction to image.  I haven't really worked out yet where all  that comes from.  Johanna:  Throughout my life I've always  had more in common.with and more communication with women. I always had really  close and good relationships with women.  The first time that I was able to express  that physically was when I was about 18.  I met a woman through some friends and was  surprised to find myself physically attracted to her as well as liking her. She was a  very vibrant, out-going, humourous woman.  A lot of things that I found attractive  about her—beautiful body, nice soft brown  hair—were things that I hadn't really  noticed in my other women friends. Lots of ;  times that I've been attracted to women it's  been on instinct, on impulse. When I first  meet them, something intrigues me.  I like the same qualities in men and women.  With men the physical attraction doesn't  happen first. I may find a man interesting  but it's not enough to make me physically  desire him. It's only after I've talked  with him and have got to know him that I  may become attracted physically. With a  woman I may see her and fantasize, a little  and have that desire immediately.  Sharon: I am attracted to both men and women who love women. I've met a few men who,  I think, love women—love "the woman within  them". They have some empathy with women,  with feminism and with the oppressions that  women feel. They are men who reject machismo.  With women it's women-oriented women who  attract me, women-positive women who are  struggling to re-define what being a woman  is, to challenge the status quo.  In terms of sexual desire as Opposed to  attraction: the relationships I've had that  have been the most special are relationships  where the sexual desire is intense and  strong; where I feel free to experience and  express my passions wholly. That happens  within a safe relationship where we have  some sort of understanding. What I feel  when I get close to someone, or when the  chemistry is right in terms of making love,  is that I physically want to bond with  them, I can't get close enough. That's  wrapped up in my sexual desire. It's  physically expressed differently with men  and women, but the intent, the desire  is the same.  With men the chemistry is different because  we're different. It seems that what feeds  that desire with men is the polarity—the  differences in our bodies and in our beings.  The polarity creates a kind of tautness  which heightens it. What feeds my desire  for women is the sameness in our bodies.  The way -our bodies fit together, whether  we're sleeping together or making love;  the way we intertwine, wrap around each  other. It's a different expression of a  similar desire.  Wendy:  I make a distinction between sexual  desire and sexual attraction as well. What  I find sexually satisfying or pleasing is  really pretty much the same between men  and women. I worry a bit that my attractions to women are based on appearances,  that because I'm playing into something  about the way we are all in this culture  taught to objectify women and think of  women's beauty and sexual attractiveness.  That bothers me a little.  It's funny ~ you almost feel that  you should apply for duel  citizenship.  Yet I get attracted to women who love themselves and who are at home in themselves,  who live in their faces and live in their  bodies. I'm not attracted to what is stereo-  typically beautiful but to women who project a physical assurance.  Johanna:  I was just drifting off, thinking  who have I been attracted to recently.  There's this woman who rides the bus. She's  already on the bus when I get on. We've  made eye contact now and then. She's very  interesting looking and attractive. Sometimes I even kind of fantasize about her in  a simple way. It's not just lpj^s-r-it's the  type of person she looks  like she is. She  s>fDfeJ?eally sel£s||esured and ^fee-spirited.  Now that I'm in a rel^^ohship I don't  really'look for attractions. I notice women  more than men. Maybe if I was in a relationship with a woman I would notice men more.  But I.do pick up on women that I'n^.attracted  to, but it's nothing that I would act upon.  It's just that I appreciate them, probably  because I'm not around women as much.  Wendy:  There are feminist assumptions  about the difference between being in  relationships with men and with women,  some of which are true and some of which  aren't. I have found, for instance, that"  I am much more able to assert myself and  make my own demands known with men. That  probably means that I don;t get what I  want with women—because I'm not speaking up. I'm much more into meeting their  needs. Partly, it's probably that I feel  that women need more looking after. Partly, I feel that I don't need to protect  men against my needs. It's an assumption  that women are going to deal with eaeh  othor in an egalitarian way and so you  don't set out to start building patterns  of. asserting your own needs.  A major difference in my relationships with  men and women is the amount that we do  together, especially at home. When I was  with a woman there were so many things we  would do—going thorugh the closest to  get dressed to go out for the evening,  gossiping, cooking together. It seems to  happen more easily in more of a cooperative way. In relationships with men,  there's been more of a male role of  protection around the house. I never had  that feeling with women, except that we  could be safe together.  Sharon:  For me in terms of nurturing or  the little touches: a hot towel after a  bath or a massage—I'm far more willing  to do those things for a woman because  I'm not worried about falling into a  mothering role. I assume that it will be  reciprocated. I've got myself into trouble with that assumption. But still, with  men I hold back longer. Communicating  with women is easier because we share  more experiences and our perceptions  are more likely to coincide. For example,  I never feel with a woman that I have to  explain how I am when I menstruate. A man  may be accepting and willing to understand but he will never know it from experience.  Wendy:  There's also ways that women share  cultural references which they don't  share with men. Things like your relationship to clothes or makeup or to women's  magazines, that level of mass culture and  how women are acculturated is something  that is part of most women's experience. .  Even if we've become feminist and chucked  out a lot of that stuff, we've probably  all felt that at some point. The first  time you got your period, the first time  you used eyeshadow, the bust development  ads in the back of the women's magazines,  all those kinds of things are common references for women, and they're not for  men. I don't think men can pick up easily  on the importance of those kinds of experiences for building female identity.  Sharon:  Similarly, feminist sub-culture  is something you can't share so intimately with a man. Often, with men, when I  tell the story of my day and I'm relating  something Intolerable that happened, I  have to start at the beginning with the  theory and talk it through to the experience. Then I can get to, "Okay, so now do  you understand why this was difficult for  me to handle today? Now will you give me  a hug?" But the difficulty in a situation  like this is partly overcome by their  commitment to understanding. They know  it's important to me, they can sense  my passion for it and then they want to  understand. My experience with men has  been that in the end, the effort to communicate is gratifying. They have told me  that they've learned more about what it is  to be a woman and they are grateful for  it. It seems to have enriched their lives  somehow. ~tjjgSj^;£ ■£ -£\*-3 ~  What's difficult about being bisexual is  that there are two worlds. There's a lesbian community and a heterosexual community. I don't feel that I can move completely at ease in the lesbian community  or in "the heterosexual world. But I re-fuse to allow that to be a barrier. I'm  trying very hard to be myself wherever I  am. As a bisexual who moves in the heterosexual world, I'm in a position of being  able to identify heterosexism, and I don't  like it. I don't like seeing heterosexism  within the lesbian community either, and I  do see it.  Johanna:  It's funny—you almost feel that  you should apply for dual citizenship!  Wendy:  I feel clear about bisexuality as a  sexual choice. But sexual choices have  social choices along with them. I feel some  what excluded from the women's community  now because I'm involved with a man. And  I feel that, therefore, the woman-loving  side of me doesn't get any social affirmation.  One of the things I think that is important  about doing this article is the whole question of bisexual visibility. But I also  think it's the question of the relation of  sexual preference to feminist politics. I  really take the position that your feminist  politics are based on your commitment to  the liberation of women, not based on who  your sexual partners are, and I would like  to see that much more clearly understood  and accepted and affirmed within the women's  movement. Talking about bisexuality is one  way of moving toward that.  October TO Kinesis   25 by Wendy Frost  The following is a selection of some useful  books and articles on feminist approaches to  sexuality.

I haven't included discussions that focus  specifically on pornography, partly for  space reasons, partly because feminist treatments of sexuality that don't focus on porn  are rarer, more recent, and probably less  well known.

Our bodies  only seem to dispute that our hearts and  minds desire lovers, flirtation, lascivi-  ousness, sensuality—the deeply felt and  the frivolous. Man crazy dyke?  by Pixie Woods  One of the many advantages of coming out  at an early age is, that with any luck,  you might never sleep with a man. Imagine  that. The number of women for whom this  is true would astound the world if the  figures were made public. There is in fact  a loosely knit group of 'virgin' lesbians,  nationwide, who can lay claim to this  honourable distinction.  The one disadvantage of belonging .to this  select group is the nagging curiosity  that lurks dangerously, impelling one to  try it—just once. Coupled with this latent desire comes a host of fantasies to  confuse the mind of the committed lesbian.  Imagine being entangled in a passionate  embrace, breast to breast, thigh to cunt:  when your mind takes you travelling to  another universe where manly arms enfold you  you and his stiff member probes the nether  reaches of the warm moist cavern between  your legs.  Not surprisingly, the language will remind  you of the trashy novels we all read as  teens that were full of lusty sex scenes,  usually badly written. Those novels were  my original source of fantasies. Happily  I have developed my own repertoire of  hot scenes with huriky men that I replay  endlessly at my pleasure. I can add or  subtract characters, change the locale,  screw the fellas silly or leave the poor  boys panting for more. It's almost too  much fun to handle. And best of all, I  don't have to make him breakfast in the  morning.  Reading this, don't think I've lost touch  with my natural desires. Fantasies are  fun, but in the flesh it's the female form  I prefer. I've never needed much encouragement to invite a woman home to my bed; it's  over inviting her into my fantasies that's  been difficult. So, just as I came out in.  real life years ago, I think it's time to  come out in my fantasy sex life today. Too  bad those lesbian sex magazines are all  getting stopped at the border.  I dream of performing ■ •... in public  by Vicky B. Goode  For too long, lesbians have had the reputation of being unadventurous stick in the  muds when it comes to sex. It is common  knowledge that we have the innate desire  to settle down in long-term monogamous  relationships and live happily ever after  in domestic bliss. And who is to say this  vision of the ideal lesbian state is untrue.  But why just domestic bliss? Why not sexual  bliss?  Even if we do meet the girl of our^ dreams  and live happily ever after, can't we have  wild sex parties, too? Can't we play with  vegetableSf-iSr bed as well as in the^g.t- .  chen? jpTan't we have sex-^B$|gf^i<3r^laees?  There, I've said it. I confess. That's what  I really want to do. I want to have sex  in public places. What a relief just to say  it out loud. I wonder if this is what Catholics feel like?  The allure of public sex has been with me  a long time but I have never acted on it.  I dream of sex on the beach by moonlight,  but I forget how cold it gets by the water  My nipples retreat...my shame grows  by Micki Prude  This is a very sensitive subject for me  to touch upon in public. My nipples. Not  sensitive in the usual sense of nipples  bursting through shirtfronts with the  slightest provocation at the most inopportune moments, just the opposite. Instead  of poking skyward like glorious mountain  peaks, my nipples invert like twin Mount  Saint Helen's.  It's no laughing matter. It's quite embar-  assing in fact. One evening when I seductively slipped into crotehless panties and  a black lace uplift brassiere with low  cut cups, I glanced down to find that my  breasts, so brazenly presented, were fronted by a pair of shy buds demurely receding  like night flowers at daybreak. The mood  of the evening was saved by my lover's  prominent pupillas standing in, or rather  standing out, in my stead.  My doctor tells me that this condition is  nothing to worry about. Medically speaking I'm sure he's right. But what does he  know about a lesbian's sex life or the  teenage trauma of being the only girl in  the locker room with disappearing, nipples  Lucky for me I was on the basketball team  and not a cheerleader where big pointy  nipples are a major qualification.  My lover also tells me not to worry. She  tells me that mountains look pretty but  it's the volcanoes that erupt with fiery  passions. Big deal, that's what I say.  Big tits without nipples is like sizzle  without the steak.  at night and I find myself never quite  prepared for the occasion.  My lust for sex in a car in a supermarket  parking lot has been thwarted by«-an even  more practical dilemma. I don't have one.  And buses are a bit too public. I've heard  that people often have sex in cabs in New  York City, but not even sex in a taxi  could entice me to go to New York City.  I personally think that the best option for  sex in a public place Is in a movie theatre  But even there one must make certain prepar-l  ations to ensure a successful foray.  First, don't choose a foreign film. Certainly Hanna Schygulla singing "Tonight You're  Mine Completely" will make your knees weak,  but foreign films are too intellectually  compelling. And you'll miss all the subtitles and lose track of the storyline.  It's best to pick a piece of Hollywood fluffy  Something that is light-hearted and romantic with the occasional slow fade to long  grasses blowing in the wind. This will  suggest the appropriate mood without getting  you too entangled in a plot which might  otherwise offend your feminist sensibilitieal  The funnest part, besides the actual sex, |  j will be assembling your easy access ward- -  robe. In the summer a pair of baggy shorts  will probably do the trick. Or, indulge your  passion for lingerie and wear a garter belt  and stockings and nothing else under your  favourite dress.  And once prepared, don't spoil the evening  by inadvertently wandering into the season's  box office smash. Sex in public yes. But  sex in a fishbowl? It might just cramp your  style. |  See you at the movies.  Your Face  Is  Your Fortune  ^^^^^^^^^^»  ^^^^^^^B  Crooked Spines STRWGHIMI5  October TO Kinesis   27 -Q  Hear Ye i  Hear Ye!

However, I did catch a few  shows, and was very impressed with the  organizational accomplishment of such a  large-scale event. Produced and directed  by Joanna Maratta of Theatrespace, this  year's festival presented over eighty  shows at nine locations.  All the venues are located within walking  distance in the Mount Pleasant area, so  that a true devotee could have spent ten  days wandering from one venue to another,  \ ...taking in alternative theatre, music and  performance art from noon to two in the  ;" ..morning.

Alternately played  by Adrienne Duncan and Kasey Roy, the excellent writing carries us along from humour, tenderness, sadness, anger and release.  Virginia speaks to Rose, who can neither  hear nor respond. She tells her about her  day, and her frustrations with the hospital . She considers their relationship, and  eventually speaks about her anger at the  situation. Underneath these words is the  steady sound of the respirator. You forget  it's there until, when it is finally turned off in an act of ultimate bravery, you  almost stop breathing yourself.  A sixty minute monologue is an enormous  challenge for an actor, but Adrienne Duncan  pulled it off very well. The build-up of  tension is smooth and subtle, as a result  the explosion of anger is not a total surprise, though no' less powerful for it.

A bleak scenario, this one. Though there  may be many women like the protagonist  walking the halls of Uii^lrsity of British Columbia even today, it's depressing  to see this woman fail to make connections with anyone likely to validate her  perceptions.

October TO Kinesis   29 saaassssssi^^  ARTS  Anti - apartheid films:  White privilege, black scars  hv Nora TV Randall       -■- ^—'  by Nora D. Randall  I think everyone should see the films  Winnie and Nelson Mandela  and Witness to  Apartheid.  The black people of South  Africa need us to know what is going on  in their country. Except for remaining  ignorant, it is the very least we can do.  What these two films show us is two generations of black people who've had to  say, my whole life and everything and  everyone in it must go to the fight to get,  rid of apartheid. Imagine for a minute  what it might feel like to have to decide  that whatever is left of your life will  have to be lived in a war in which the  other side has tanks, planes, guns, tear  gas, whips, dogs, prisons, and torture.  And you have your friends, your children,  stones and world opinion.  I read in the Vancouver Sun  that when the  protestors broke the South African wine  bottles, other customers in the liquor  store got angry and shouted, "We want the  right to decide for ourselves." Those  people should see these films. I somehow  doubt that they'll bother because I suspect that what they really meant is "I  want the right not to know or care". These  films don't allow you that.  The most striking thing for me in the Winnie and Nelson Mandela film was Winnie's  face. It wasn't immobile. I had to think  about it a lot, different expressions did  cross her face and there were times—when  she talked about the effects that sixteen  months of solitary confinement can have on  the human mind—when her eyes and mouth  got very nervous and there was a hitch in  her voice. But the overall expression on  her face is one of solid calm.  boarding school. (They had to go out of  the country to school because the local  schools were too afraid to have them. ) Some  people may think that their lives are like  this because they are trouble makers, but  one thing these films make clear is that  black people in South Africa have trouble  whether or not they try to change it.  In Witness to Avartheid we hear Rev. Desmond Tutu say he doesn't understand why  people still consider him a leader because  in all the years he's worked for peaceful  change he's been able to deliver nothing.  He says that people often think of what  the black South Africans are going through  as similar to the civil rights movement in  the United States. He says the thing we  have to remember is that the American black  people had the law on their side. In South  Africa, the law is against them.  This seems like an understatement as we  see to what depths the white government  is prepared to sink to protect their privilege. We see the scars from torture on  children. We listen to the parents of a  young boy who was shot in the head at  school. We see the poverty in the black  townships. Then we go to the cities and  interview the white people on the streets.  One white woman who was interviewed said  that she had never had any reason to visit  the townships, and she thought the blacks  were just confused by the communists. That  they had a pure white race there and they  were prepared to wipe out all the black  people to maintain it, otherwise "we would  all be chocolate coloured." The other  whites interviewed on the streets had similar views.  Winnie Mandela returns home  from solitary confinement to  her daughters  Zenzi (left) and Zinzi, 1970  It occurred to me after a while that she  looks like a person who has, had to give  up living on the surface and retreat to a  place deep inside herself where she nurtures a flame. Of Nelson we see only pictures because he's been in jail since  1961. This is a victory. According to the  narration, world opinion kept the government from executing Nelson and the other  men who were tried at the same time.  That there is such a strong bond between  these two people is a tribute to the human  spirit because the government has kept  them apart most of their lives. They write  but many of the. letters have been destroyed—seized when the police searched her  house or burned when it was firebombed.  Winnie also tells how the police separated  her from her children by arresting her just  when they were about to come home from  30    Kinesis October TO  Nelson and Winnie Mandela in the early 1960's.  There were also interviews with white people who are working with black people  against apartheid and a picture of the  bombed out home of one of them. There's a  war going on in South Africa and we're not  seeing it on the news. Not the way we saw  the civil rights movment in the United  States, not the way we saw the Vietnam War.  When it comes to what's going on in South  Africa or Central or South America, we're  being tranquilized.  If you want to kick the habit, you can still  get information. These two films can be  ordered from Idera, 2524 Cypress St.,  Vancouver, BC, (604) 738-8815. Winnie and  Nelson Mandela  is available in 16mm film  and 3/4 inch video for approximately $75-  110. Witness to Apartheid  is available in  16mm for approximately $125.  It's easier not to know,'but it's little  enough for us to do when thousands of black  South Africans are giving their lives. I  came out of these films afraid. Not only  for the South Africans, but for all of us.  What kind of world will we be living in if  they do not succeed in destroying apartheid?  They must succeed.  Marianne and Juliane headline benefit  Marianne and Juliane,  Margarethe von  Trotta's first film about two political  sisters in the 1970s will be a major feature of the Women and Words Societies'  fundraiser at the Ridge Theatre at 2 pm  on Sunday, November 2.  The film is based onthe true story of two  daughters of a protestant minister. One  is a political activist, terrorist, the  other devotes herself to social work and  working on a feminist magazine. Their  differing paths cause strife and lead to  tragic consequences but the bond between  them remains intractable. Von Trotta says  this film is her attempt to look at both  the interior and the exterior of the  sisters' lives.  Another feature of the afternoon will be  the premier of Sara Diamond's video of the  Womens' Voices: A Vancouver Mosiac project.  This video, which will run in the lobby,  includes segments of Kandace Kerr's Her-  story workshop; interviews with women who  gave their oral histories to the project;  and, a short scene from The Lost and Found,  a play by Nora D. Randall.  The money raised will be used to pay off  the debts of the Women's Voices project.  Admission is $4.00 for employed, $2.00  for seniors, children and unemployed.

Jamie is a lesbian and Charlie is gay and  both believe in the importance of working  together. Obviously, for them, it is a partnership that works. Jamie is a fine cellist,  and Charlie plays guitar and sings. Their  music runs a wide range from loud and fun  to thoughtful and haunting.  Charlie and Jamie are up front about what  they believe, and are trying to get their  music across to a diversity of people. The  lyrics, based in earth centred spirituality,  are highly political. Charlie, the writer,  creatively avoids the tone of a political  lecture giving his lyrics poetry and  reality. Their music is entertaining and  enjoyable, ranging from softer melodies  featuring Jamie's cello, to hard driving,  rythmic dance tunes.  What do you see is the role of your music?  Jamie:  Our music has several roles; to inspire people, and put across stories that  we've heard. Charlie's the songwriter, so  a lot of his experiences and perceptions  come through the music. One of the things  the band has allowed us to do is get people  up and moving. It's brought us into a  realm of performance that political music  usually doesn't reach—bars and clubs.  Charlie:  Hopefully.we serve several political functions 'at once. One is the politics  of what we talk about. We've been really  inspired by a visit to Nicaragua and some  of the songs we do are about Central America. Some of the songs express a broader  world view, an earth centred spirituality,  and try to do that in a way that doesn't  create a lot of unnecessary boundaries.  In Seattle our audiences tend to be a  mixture of gay people, straight people,  men and women, which is my goal. If there  was ever a time not to ghettoize our consciousness it is now. Particularly because  the gay community is so much under attack  and the Right, in the US, is so active.  It's really a time not to internalize that  and retreat, it's a time to get out there  and to acknowledge that "hey, we're not  strange", and the message that we have is  something that a lot of people, can hear.  One of the many political purposes of the  band is to take the music beyond the circles of the already convinced. We played  a gig at a college that was into a frat  scene, and we were really apprehensive  about it, and here were these typical  macho guys dancing up a storm to the song  "Gay Spirit". There's something of value  here that I take special.delight in.   Jamie:   I think that there is a growing  number of people who do not want to hear  lyrics talking about "poor me" or women  who are oppressed or whatever negative  message is being put out by a lot of music  today. A lot of people want to hear music  that they can listen to and feel good about,  and dance to.  The first time I heard your music was at a  women's party.  We were listening and dancing to typical women's music a la California^  and someone put on .some of your songs—and.  here was this man singing songs about things  which spoke to us as women.  Charlie:  A large part of our really strong  support is the women's community, they've  responded more than gay men have. At the  same time I'm happy for the support that  we get, I think it's emblematic of where  the men are—gay or straight—that it's  taken them longer.  Do you think it 's important that gay and  straight people work together?  Jamie:  Yeah, I think also that we do'let  prospective members know that we are gay,  and won't work with anyone who is homophobic. There are certain political morals  or beliefs that people have to live to play  with our band.  How do you see yourselves accountable or  responsible to your audience as performers?  Charlie:  You would get a different answer  if you asked that question in Nicaragua,  where the cultural movement is very much  supported by the government and the government understands the transformative power  of art.  mm •;yi  In this country artists are victims of the  market economy. In order to make a living  beyond your values and ideals, you've got to  be able to pay the rent. That takes a whole  other level of accountability. And we don't  really have a cultural movement here. We  have networks of artists and there's a real  difference between a network and a movement.  When something becomes a movement, that's  where holding each other accountable comes  into play. We really don't have that here.  What sorts of barriers do you run into,  and  what have you accomplished despite them?  Charlie:  One of the biggest stumbling blocks  is always money. We're really undercapitalized . We get as far as we can on what we  have. We're able to work a lot of regular  clubs in Seattle and we're getting airplay  for our record, but we really don't have  the set-up to promote it on a mass scale. So  we go on gradually building our audience and  that feels good because what we do have is  really solid and growing.  Are you able to support your music by playing,  or do you have to have outside-jobs?  Jamie:  At this point we all have outside jobs  At certain times of the year we're able to  take a bit of time off to tour and to rehearse more, but we're all working right now.  What sorts of plans do you have for the future?  Charlie:  We're working on a video project  about Central America, that not only talks  about what's happening there, but about  the political situation in the US that  creates the conditions of war in Nicaragua.  Hopefully our first segment will be finished in December. We're working on fund-  raising for another record. We have enough  material for another two or three. We'll  probably do another west coast tour and  we hope to get up to Vancouver more often.  Jamie:  I'm going to be putting out a cello  focused- solo album, and I think the band  as a whole is going to be exploring vari- •  eties of music. We're a band that isn't  pegged in one certain style. We do dance  music, and yet we also have acoustic music  that's softer. We'll be focusing more on  our direction in the future.  discography:  Catch the Fire: Good Fairy Productions 1001,  July 1981,   (LP); Canticles of Light: 1984;  Fierce Love: With Rumours of the Big Wave,  (EP).

Native Tongue  by Suzette Haden Elgin, Daw Books,  New  York,  1984,   301 pages.  The Handmaid's Tale  by Margaret'Atwood, McLelland and Stewart,  1985.  A world where the oppression of women is  .as extreme as our worst nightmares—the  subject holds a kind of grim fascination  for feminist readers. How b&d'could  it  get? These three books present a desolate  picture of women's, lives in the future.  They are not easy to read. What makes them  exciting is their portrayal of women as  resilient, and sometimes .even uppity, in  horrifying circumstances.  The Handmaid's Tale  is Margaret Atwood's  first foray into speculative fiction. In  many ways the most plausible of the three  books, the story takes place just a few  years from now, perhaps before the end of  this century. As the unnamed heroine  recalls everyday life as a college student  in a New England town, her current existence as a surrogate mother in a rigid,  sexist society seems all the more terrifying.  Women's political and economic rights have  been eliminated by law in the blink of an  eye. Women are not permitted to vote, to  work in paid employment or even to handle  money. (In a radio interview, Atwood said  that everything in the book had a basis in  fact and the one scenario she thought she'd  invented—the funeral for a foetus—was  depicted in a newspaper clipping someone  sent to her recently.)  Along with powerful and very painful scenes  of women's lives as the world closes in on  them, Atwood also examines the subtleties  of sexual politics, including "good" men's  enjoyment of their superior status. But in  The Handmaid's Tale,   sisterhood is not a  tool for liberation. Generally women are  seen to collude in the oppression of each  other, especially along class lines. The  heroine becomes increasingly dependent on  men for support and for that reason I was  somewhat disappointed in the book, though  I loved Atwood's spare style and her ability to make her characters' experiences  tangible.  Native Tongue  was a good antidote. It also  tells the story of a society rigidly structured by gender, but in family groupings  (the Lines) where women serve men in ways  that are guaranteed to appall you. The difference is that the women have organized  themselves to create their own world  under the very noses of their oppressors.  Not that the men aren't suspicious. As one  explains:  The women had a tendency to accomplish  changes by altering things one infinitesimal fraction at a time, spread over months  and months, so that you never saw it happening until suddenly it was just there...  he well remembered a rock garden that had-  appeared once, complete with three giant  boulders that seemingly sprung instantaneously from the earth...  The extra twist to Native Tongue  has to do  with the author's occupation. Suzette Haden  Elgin is a linguist, and the power of language is a central theme of the story. The  people of the Lines have a special expertise in acquiring languages. Since life in  the twenty-third century revolves around  earth's trading relationships*with innumerable alien cultures, the livelihood of the  Lines is wrapped up in their indispensable  service as interpreters. ....^.j^*'*^.  The. women carry a double load, working full-  time in the interpreter's booth and doing  all the household work. (Imagine our surprise'.) The joy in their lives comes from  their secret project: the women of the  Lines are slowly and meticulously creating  a language for women, using their remarkable  skills for their own enjoyment.  But how will they know when the time is  right to bring their language to life by beginning to speak it? Their struggle to decide makes engrossing reading for anyone who  has ever had an intense opinion about political strategy. And the unpredictable results  of their decision can remind us (as it  teaches them) about the remarkable power  of collective action.  Walk To The End Of The World  is the first  in a series of books Suzy Charnas has  written about the ferns, a society of women  in a world ruled by men. This book sets  the stage, introducing us to life after  the Wasting, a nuclear-ecological disaster.  For sixty pages Charnas describes the  Holdings, peopled entirely by men. Any  references to women are in the form of  " curses or insults; to be "unmanly" is almost a crime in a sharp-edged world where  men conspire against each other for power,  and open violence is the major mode of  social control.  When the story-line eventually leads to the  ferns, the portrayal of their degradation  borders on gruesome. Women are "unmen"—  not people. They are used as drudges and  breeders; many never learn to speak and  some live their lives as beasts of burden,  replacing the. animals eliminated by, J.feC^  Wasting. I knew"Charnas' images would  haunt me. The only thing that kept me reading was the back cover's promise that  "there were rebel ferns planning revenge".  When finally the story shifts to Alldera,  a fem who has seemed incidental to the !  plot, we learn how women have worked together to survive despite repeated attempts  by men to exterminate them. The self-  serving ignorance of the men who blame the  women for every disaster, including the  Wasting, is juxtaposed with the bitter  intelligence of Alldera. She knows the  true story: how the military leaders who  "murdered the world" emerged from the  safety of their bunkers to dominate the  few survivors. As the story proceeds,  Alldera experiences a kind of consciousness-raising, and by the end of the book,  she's on her way to the rebel womenI  These books said a lot to me, especially  about how oblivious the oppressor can be  to the pain of the oppressed. But when I  finished reading them, I was glad J knew  where to find some rebel women too!  **>.  vsn  mmm  "CCEC invests in cooperation.

Brooks' article "American Pro-Lifers open  3,000 pseudo-abortion clinics", Sept. '86).  This terminology infers that those of us  who are not "pro-life" are "anti-life"  or "pro-abortion". I believe it is no  accident that anti-abortionists have adopted the "pro-life" handle. They are aware of  the multiple messages inherent in those  words: that the anti-abortionists support  and protect life, while pro-choice supporters destroy or do not value life. These  messages are simplistic, inaccurate and  misleading.  Those of us who support a woman's right to  reproductive freedom are not "pro-abortion".  We believe that the power to choose should  be in the hands of the individual woman,  not the state, the church, or any other  group or institution.  In accurate, honest and clear terms, then,  someone who supports a woman's right to  choose when or whether to give birth is  pro-choice;  those who do not are anti-  abortionists.  Mary Hackney  those who act to solve problems one small  step at a time will make the decade a  success, not those who spend their time  planning and programming the sector. It is  our belief that why our rural women and  girls are suffering from barbaric, dehumanized and superstitious age-long traditions  such as the so-called female circumcision  is because of a lack of practical information which could change their lives.  We salute your courage in helping us for  not all our womenfolk who are aware of our  plights are courageous to take the decision  of donating to our cause. We implore you to  note that circumcision is not a practice  one can eradicate overnight. It has evolved  over centuries and has links with control  over sexuality. Therefore you should explore  all avenues for continuous financial support for us to continue in our campaign until the total victory is won..  Thank you for your support and please tell  anyone you come in contact with of our  plight and call on them to come to our aid  in the interest of international feminism.  We love you. In sisterhood,  Hannah Edemikpong  Women's Centre  P.O. Box 185, EKET  Cross River State, Nigeria  West Africa  Unfair picture of  women's conference  Nigeria women's  centre stays in touch  Kinesis:  In a spring issue of Kinesis  there was a  short note requesting financial support to  the Eket Women's Centre in their campaign  to educate against female circumcision.  Enclosed is the letter that I received from  them in response to my sending a donation.  I thought it would be an interesting,  informative addition to the next issue of  Kinesis  as well as function as yet another  plea for money to be sent to the Women's  Centre.  Daphne Hnatiuk  My Dear Daphne Hnatiuk:  I am delightful to recieve your letter and  a cheque of $20 as your donation towards  our massive education campaign against  female circumcision. Our women have long  been suffering from the agony of this outrageous and dehumanizing tradition for too  long and our campaign is, obviously, the  first local initiative towards the emancipation of women from this situation.  Although we are being threatened by traditionalists for female circumcision and we  are being labelled as traitors to our people for exposing the dirty linen of our  people to the outside world, we are unshaken in our efforts. So far, we have  received only $212 from our worldwide appeal for funds, and although the fund so  far derived for the campaign is too small,  comparing with the multitude of programs  that need funds for execution, we are undaunted in pursuing our goals.  Our government and its agencies consider  the subject too sensitive to assist education programs with funding, but we of this  Centre are resolute that in spite of serious financial constraints arising from  our poor funding the campaign shall continue. We believe, and sincerely too, that  Kinesis:  \r  The BC-Yukon Association of Women's Centres was pleased that Kinesis was present  at the birth of our association at Nara-  mata in May.  The achievement of the eighty-six women  present is significant as BC is only the  second province to form a much needed provincial association. Quebec women recently  celebrated the first anniversary of the  forming of their association.  While we were happy to see much of the  Association press release appear in the  June Kinesis,  we must respond to the somewhat negative and inaccurate reporting of  some of the conference proceedings.  Women were definitely not in disagreement  that BC women's centres should and do  work from a feminist perspective. The  question of applying a feminist perspective in our centres was not an issue. What  did occur was a discussion of the impact  of the word feminism in some communities  and among some women not yet involved in  the centres. I believe all delegates consider themselves feminists and the Association is most definitely working from and  within a feminist perspective.  Women struggled to come up with a  definition to be adopted by the Association.  Following much discussion, however, it was  agreed time restraints would not permit  an adequate analysis of the term, and that  feminism would be included in our constitution .  The discussion around the name of our  association hardly constituted real "political differences". While no doubt many  ideologies were represented (as would be  expected with a delegation of 86) there  was not argument ("after much argument")  but good honest debate. The name chosen  for an association is vital to the cohe-  siveness and progress of the- group. And  as such, we believed the time spent considering "association" or "coalition" was  worthwhile. It is worth noting that  22 women convinced 26 women that the term  association would enable them to better  carry out our work in their respective  For the good of the group and the association, women accepted this—signalling our  solidarity and the need for a strong provincial lobby group.  Finally, the repeated use of the words  arguing and argument in the page one article paints an unfair picture of the arduous  four days work. The negative connotation  the words project is something we have come  to expect in the mainstream press.  I think all in attendance would agree the  conference was the success we had hoped for  And, our success was largely the result of  the continuous discussion, consultation and  debate among us.
