KIMMJiS  news about women that's not in the dailies  $  i, LABOUR  Equal pay struggle is making Employers' Council very jumpy  By Kinesis staff writers  Equal pay for work of equal value is a  struggle whose time has come. And the employer, the Greater Vancouver Regional District, had better wake up to that fact.  This was the message several hundred striking civic workers and their supporters  sent to the GVRD at a rally outside Vancouver City Hall March 31. The GVRD, speakers  said, had better catch up with the 20th  century before the 21st is upon us.  The rally, which marked the end of the  second month of the strike, raised the  question: why is this strike being needlessly prolonged?  CUPE representatives pointed out that they  "have repeatedly charged that the GVRD is  being pressured and is taking its orders  from the Employers' Council of B.C. This  council is composed of the big corporations in the province such as those in  the forest industry, pulp and paper, mining, and the oil and chemical industry."  President of the employers' council, Bill  Hamilton, has urged Burnaby school board  to oppose "granting inside workers similar  rates to outside workers" because it "will  have a serious crippling effect...and a  negative impact upon...other employees."  Now that all sounds remarkably like the refrain from The Bosses' Lament, a song sung  at the rally: "Whatever will we do, whatever on this earth/ When all the secretaries demand what they are worth."  The largest non-union group of workers in  this province are office workers. Perish  the day, the bosses lament, when they join/  their sisters in the public sector and  ask for a just wage.  Imagine how much it.would cost the large  corporations I What if every union started  pushing for equal pay for work of equal  value I  Unions working to close wage gap  But the interference of the employers'  council, said the striking members of CUPE,  the VMREU and the GVRDEU, merely strengthens their resolve.  "We want fair pay and equal pay and we're  going to get it," vowed Aphrodite Harris  amid applause. Harris, a member of CUPE  Local 389 and a librarian from North Vancouver, told the rally that the current  GVRD offer would merely widen the wage gap  between female inside workers and male outside workers from 21%  to 34%.  "Women are no longer going to accept second  class status. Our contribution to the workforce must be recognized and paid for accordingly."  Striker challenges May Brown  Harris had a question for Vancouver city  council member, May Brown. As a member of  Vancouver Status of Women, how can she not  support this struggle for equal pay for  work of equal value?  "It is simply not the case," Debra Lewis  pointed out, "that there are no scales  available for evaluating what is meant  by * equal value'. Study after study has  been done, based on education, experience,  responsibility, skill and working conditions .  Lewis, who was speaking on behalf of Vancouver Status of Women, added that "all  of these studies show what we know already  — that women workers are being ripped  off."  Equal pay for work of equal value is worth  the struggle, said Heather Layton, who  brought greetings to the striking civic  workers from the RNABC. "Nurses know what  it's like to get short-changed by government, " Layton explained. "Thousands of us  support your fight today. We will cheer  your victory tomorrow."  Pat Davitt, who frequently sings at ral  lies, spoke at this one as well. She's  a striking VMREtt" member, and she pointed  out that more studies about equal value  are the last thing women need. 74%  of the  clerical workers for Vancouver city earn  less than the outside base rate. Half of  those city clerical workers take home  less than a woman on welfare with two kids.  With wages below the poverty level you  don't need studies. You need a decent contract .  Phone your local civic politicians and demand that they get on with negotiating a  just settlement which equalizes the base  rates for inside workers and outside workers.  At VSW, we have complete lists of phone  numbers and addresses for council members  in the various lower mainland municipalities. Call us at 736-1313 and we'll give  you,'the ones you need.  In mid-march, a group of fed-up Vancouver  citizens expressed their dissatisfaction  with the recalcitrant city management by  holding a garbage party on the steps of  city hall. Bag after bag of garbage was  piled on the steps and at the entrances,  and the demand for equal pay for work of  equal value was expressed through songs  composed especially for the event.  A week later, the garbage group was back  again. But this time their garbage was  symbolic — a huge plastic bag with slogans on it.  B.C. Tel workers go back  By Janet Berry  On March 23 the lock-out officially ended,  with the return to work of the 11,000 B.C.  Tel workers. I'm one of them.  The union membership voted 815? in favour  of the company's offer. For clerical workers, the base rate is now $51.95 a day;  for operators, the base rate is $50.91.  For the storemen (the warehouse personnel)  the base rate is 76.06 while the instal  ler-repairman starts at 65.13.  The operators* top rate is 67.96; the  installers* top rate is 103.07. (Like  many companies, B.C.Tel is still riddled  with sexist terminology).  For the operators and lower level clerical  staff, the money seems to be not nearly  as good as for the other classifications.  There was no catch-up clause for either  operators or lower level clericals.—  there are ten wage groups in the clerical section.  Several of the women I picketed with are  in wage group four, which now has a base  rate of $55.04 a day, a meagre gain.  At the voting meeting I attended, one woman got up and said that the "contract  raped women." There were boos and hisses.  In an earlier meeting, an operator had  urged the rejection of the offer as it  wasn't good enough for operators and lower  clerical wage groups.  The sentiment of several union officials  is that by 1982 the base rate for the operators will be 57.02, a compound percentage gain of 46.8$. And by that time the  group three clerical workers, for example,  will have a base rate of 58.18 — a percentage increase of 47.95?. Thus they will  have a percentage increase over three years  that is greater than the percentage increase in other, higher, job classifications.  I'm confused about all these percentages.  And I suspect that several others are, too.  The reality lies not in percentages and  so on, but in the net amount in a pay  cheque.  President of the Telecommunications Workers' Union Bill Clarke told the Sun that  he would like to see improvements in the  operators' working environment.  Clearly, it's going to be a long, hard  struggle for work and wage improvements. Kinesis April'81        3  IWD  International Women's Day: we turned out despite the weather  For the first time since 1977, it rained  on our International Women's Day march and  rally. Despite that, more than 800 people  came together to share joy in our victories and determination for the struggles  ahead.  We've had a few victories, said chairperson for the rally, Frances Wasserlein.  "CUPE women and men are fighting for  equal pay for work of equal value. TWU is  fighting to narrow the wage gap between  high and low paid workers. Women and men  continue to organize to ensure women choice  about abortion. Work goes on to organize  unorganized workers, most of whom are women.  "Ten years ago there were no transition  houses for battered women and their children in B.C. Now there are almost 20. Ten  years ago, women were not organized to  fight violence against us. We are struggling against the now visible  forms that  violence takes: rape, battery, pornography.  "These victories," concluded Frances Wasserlein, "encourage us to keep moving."  And keep moving we must, for we are facing  hard times.  Focus of this year's IWD activities was  the high cost of living and among the hardest hit by escalating costs are women on  welfare, single mothers. Society must realise that women who work in the home bringing up the next generation are making an  invaluable contribution. We are not social  parasites, stressed Vancouver Welfare  Rights Coalition spokesperson Cathy Hunter.  Also hard hit are immigrant women, who are  forced into the most miserably-paid forms  of waged work. In addition, as Harminder  Senghera of the India Mahila Association  told the rally, immigrant women suffer  the isolation of being surrounded by an  alien culture and language.  Extreme double oppression is also experienced by our Native sisters, Nilak Butler  explained to us.  The rise of the Right is one of the consequences of tightening economic conditions. And the Right vents its hatred in  patricular upon lesbians and gay men. Linda Reudrich, for the Lesbian Conference  Committee called upon "everyone... to recognize that they must support lesbian and  gay rights and speak up next time someone  is telling 'queer' jokes and offer solidarity if you see us being harassed on the  streets or in our jobs."  Emphatic support for current union struggles was very much in evidence at the  rally. Marie Renholme of the Canadian  Association of Industrial, Mechanical and  Allied Workers outlined CAIMAW's successful battle at Canadian Kenworth for equal  pay for work of equal value.  The interconnections between all these issues was something each speaker tried to  bring out. As Frances Wasserlein put it,  our cost of living is indeed high, but  even it "is kept down by the exploitation  of women in other countries." In this context, Lourdes Caravajo from the Committee  for the Defence for the Committee of Human  Rights in Chile urged us to unite in solidarity with women in Latin America. LOCAL STRUGGLES  Axworthy dallies over Daphne  Williams decision  Daphne Williams' fate is still up in the  air as the eleventh-hour dramatics continue.  When confronted March 6, Immigration Minister Lloyd Axworthy advised Daphne Williams personally that he would act on the  matter. At that time he suggested he would  consider issuing a ministerial permit.  Supported by the International Committee  Against Racism (INCAR), Daphne Williams  has repeatedly explained her position to  the immigration department: she needs her  status as a domestic worker renewed.  She hasn't been permitted to work since  August 1980 and she has five children to  support back home.  Daphne Williams is a Jamaican woman who  had been working in Canada since 1973.  Her work visa ran out in 1976; she didn't  renew it because she didn't know she had  to. When the immigration department found  out about this, it started deportation  proceedings.  In late January of this year, a federal  Court of Appeal turned down a deportation  order against her, and a new hearing was  set in motion.  That new hearing has been stalled four  times as the adjudicator waits to see  which way Axworthy is going to jump.  Now the adjudicator's patience has run  out. He says he'll proceed with the hearing March 30 and that he won't entertain  any further immigration department requests for an adjournment.  What Daphne Williams must have is a work  visa, not a ministerial permit (which  could be revoked at any time without appeal). With changes upcoming in the federal regulations concerning domestic workers, she deserves to be included in any  small benefits which may result.  On March 24 an INCAR spokesperson, Susan  Hoeppner, demanded an immediate response  from Axworthy. She told him, "Daphne "Williams has lived in poverty and under  threat of deportation for eight months.  She has endured five hearings and a Federal Court Appeal. She has been required  to report personally to the local immigration offices once a week throughout  this entire process. "      Q  VICTORY: On March 30, at 11 a.m.,  Daphne  Williams received a work permit. Her  hearing was due to start at 2 p.m.  Can flight attendants work  throughout pregnancy?  CALFAA is back in the courts  Can flight attendants work through their  pregnancies? The Canadian Air Flight  Attendants Association (CALFAA) has been  fighting Pacific Western Airlines for this  rights since 1974.  The latest round is now in progress in the  B.C. Court of Appeal.  CALFAA says that the Canada Labour Code  gives attendants the right to work until  the end of their pregnancies, and then to  take a minimum of six weeks leave after  the birth.  PWA used to force flight  attendants to leave their jobs after the  fourth month. Now it doesn't allow them  to fly after the seventh month.  CALFAA's latest contract with PWA, which  provides for mandatory leave after the  seventh month, means that flight attendants  must lose at least seventeen weeks pay.  The union maintains that Labour Code  provisions give the flight attendants the  right .to^choose between the collective  agreement or labour code regulations. PWA  is arguing that the collective agreement  is binding, and that the Labour Code  offers no such alternative.  Florence Kemp's jail term just, judges decide  By Gillian Marie  Florence Kemp, a single mother guilty of  the 'crime' of welfare fraud, lost her  battle in the B.C. Court of Appeals March  23. She had been appealing the severity  of hor sentence.  For having earned just over the allowed  $100 a month for eighteen months, Florence Kemp must serve 90 days in Oakalla,  on every Saturday for almost two years.  During that time she must also perform  two hours a week of community work.  Her lawyer, Diane Kilpatrick, argued that  Florence had had no choice but to defraud  the ministry of human resources —v she  and her daughter could not live on the  money paid to her by welfare.  Neither could she keep herself and her  daughter on the inadequate wages paid to  her when she worked at Burnaby Homemakers'  for $4 an hour.  Florence had told her social workers of  her plight. She let them know her intention not to declare part of her income in  the months that she needed it to survive.  never told it would be criminal offence  At no time, Kilpatrick pointed out, was  Florence Kemp warned by social workers  that what she was contemplating could  lead to criminal charges. "Ms.Kemp had no  criminal intent in not declaring her earned income. She had no sophisticated  scheme in mind." The fact that she  accepted payment by cheques that could  be easily traced demonstrates, Kilpatrick  told the court, Florence Kemp's lack of  criminal intent.  The three male judges — Justices Seaton,  Craig and Hutcheon — agreed that welfare  payments are inadequate to feed, clothe  and shelter recipients.  The question of restitution was raised:  Florence was prepared to repay the $2600  as soon as she could. One of the judges  commented, "It certainly is unrealistic  to expect repayment from a welfare recipient." This judge compared the moral severity of, the 'crime' Florence had committed with that of people crossing the border and not declaring the goods they had  purchased in Seattle.  Kilpatrick hastened to point out that'  there is an enormous difference between  not declaring luxury items purchased in  the States and not declaring income in  order to survive, physically.  It seemed apparent that this judge had  had no experience of the difficulties of  living on welfare. As to the subterfuge  at border crossings, one can only surmise  After hearing only a part of the crown  prosector's statement, the three judges  conferred and unanimously decided that  Florence had been given a just sentence.  Whereupon they dismissed the appeal.  One of the most unfortunate consequences  of this whole case has been the impact of  the trial and sentencing on Florence and  her daughter. Her daughter has run away  from home. She does not want to return  until her mother has completed her sentence. So the two are now estranged. The  ministry of human resources has assisted  in the break-up, at least temporarily, of  this family unit: they are paying for the  girl to remain in a foster home for the  time being.  Asked if she was contemplating an appeal  to the Supreme Court, Florence replied,  "I don't think so. For one thing, it is expensive, and I don't have the money. For  another, I have given up on the legal system. There doesn't seem to be any justice  in that route."  What Florence would like to see is a change  in the GAIN Act, Schedule B, Section 6b,  so that people on welfare could earn more  than the current limit of $100 a month.  "People on welfare need this kind of assistance," Kemp pointed out. "Women don't  earn enough to support their families adequately. If welfare permitted women to do  some work while collecting welfare — so  that they could adequately support their  families — the welfare rolls would eventually diminish. In this way, people would  be assisted in the transition period between between being on welfare and working  at a paid job."  The Florence Kemp Defence Fund, launched  last month by Vancouver Status of Women,  has been successful in raising some money  to meet the appeal costs. There is still  time to donate!  Write to Human Resources Minister Grace  McCarthy demanding that the GAIN Act be  changed, particularly Schedule B, Section  6b.  VSW IS MOVING  Vancouver Status of Women is moving April  15.

Kinesis April'81  LOCAL STRUGGLES  Citizens protest the erosion of province's medicare system  For the past couple of months, the newspapers have been filled with doctors'  demands for a 41%  increase in their fees  and threats to extra bill their patients  beginning April 1 if their demands aren't  met.  While most of the debating has been between the provincial government and the  B.C. Medical Association, health workers,  advocates and consumers are concerned and  have begun speaking out against this erosion in the medicare system which particularly affects people on low and fixed  incomes, the majority of whom are women.  Protest rally outside BCMA buildings  On March 7, there was a protest rally at  the BCMA. office at 10th and Burrard. The  Vancouver Women's Health Collective participated, and Beth Hutchinson, a member  of the Collective, told the rally: "We  are here to join with others in protesting  the outrageous proposals of the B.C.  doctors to further raise medical fees. We  already pay for all the medical care we  receive — out of our taxes and out of  premiums.  The establishment of extra  billing brings back the two class system  of health care. Those who can afford to  pay the new marked-up price will continue  to go to the doctors they choose.  'All the rest of us, including the elderly,  those on fixed incomes, single mothers  and their children, working women who earn  only 58$ of what men get paid — we will  be forced to neglect our health or use the  already overcrowded emergency facilities  in local hospitals.  $55,800 isn't exactly poverty  "The doctors talk about being trapped by  inflation along with the rest of us. They  want to maintain their standard of living  as we all do. Their standard of living is  based on an average net income of $55,800.  That $55,800 is take-home pay after expenses such as office rental, staff salaries and equipment are taken off. This  hardly compares with the standard of  living of the average working person. With  all the differences that there are between  the unionized carpenter and the single  woman on welfare with three children,  neither one comes close to the doctors *  standard of living.  "So far iii this issue the major players  have been the doctors and the government.  In fact between the two of them, they  have complete' control over the price and  nature of health care in B.C. For ten  years the Women's Health Collective has  worked to change health care in B.C.,  especially for women. There are many inadequacies in the system that we have,  including:  the overuse of drugs which in themselves  pose hazards to our health; unnecessary  surgery; and exposure to radiation through  too many and often unnecessary x-rays.  "We are appalled at this proposal that we  pay even more for a system that is'nt  working for us. We know how important a  powerful consumer voice in health care can  be. It's good to hear that voice getting  louder." Q  B.C. Health Coalition will  coordinate resistance  Further resistance to extra billing plans  will be coming from the B.C. Health Coalition. More than 25 health, community,  church, labour and women's groups attended  a coalition meeting March 9 to express anger at the doctors' attempt to destroy  medicare.  Cole Dudley was there from Vancouver  Status of Women.  Organizer of the meeting and manager of  CU&C, David Schreck, told the groups that  the board of CU&C has voted to advise  members to destroy their Visa cards if  Visa goes ahead with its agreement with  the B.C. Medical Association to facilitate  direct patient billing.  CU&C will also publish lists of doctors  who do not agree to extra billing. And  they'll tell patients how they can walk  out without paying.  The groups at the coalition meeting expressed fundamental opposition to extra  billing as a tactic, because it hits hardest at the poorest segments of society.  The consensus of the meeting was that  doctors must look instead to the traditional weapons of collective bargaining —  the withdrawal of non-essential services  and the use of a strike.  Only one representative at the meeting  protested. He was Dr. John O'Brien Bell,  BCMA board member. He said that he rejected "completely" the suggestion of  the strike alternative.  The BCMA has refused to go to arbitration.  O'Brien also complained that medicare encouraged the feckless public to go nipping  off to the doctors all the time with  "trivial" complaints.  Although the BCMA. is trying to downplay  the move by terming it "balanced billing",  extra billing is the first step towards  the dismantling of medicare.  Opposition to the BCMA proposals must be  expressed now, and loudly.  Health Minister Jim Nielsen is saying that  he'll introduce legislation in the house  to prevent doctors from going ahead with  their plans for extra billing. Just as we  go to press, such a bill has passed ap^  proval for its second reading.  Earlier, B.C. Federation of Labour had  blasted Nielsen's "apparent willingness to  allow extra billing" by doctors as "blind  incompetence."  Fed president Jim Kinnaird accused the  government of not caring at all for the  people of B.C.  "They can sink a billion  dollars of public money into holes in the  ground for their corporate friends,"  charged Kinnaird, referring to North East  Coal, "but they're willing to let medicare  and other health services fall apart because there's no money."  Here they come, folks: bigger  and bigger B.C. premiums  Last May the provincial health ministry  announced that it would be raising the  premiums for medicare annually to keep in  step with the cost of living.  Now Finance Minister Hugh Curtis is pro-  Northern California Alliance/LNS  mising more, and worse.  In announcing his budget, he said that  premiums must finance 35$ of the cost of  medicare, "therefore, as costs rise — as  they are expected to do this year following a new contract settlement with  physicians — 35% of the increase will be  paid by premiums."  Margaret Marsh pleads not  guilty to midwife charge  Margaret Marsh has pleaded not guilty to  the charge of practising midwifery. The  trial, which concluded in Victoria on  March 4> is the first in the history of  B.C. to involve such a charge.  In July 1978, Margaret Marsh attended the  birth of the child of Betty and Mark Am-  brey in Saanich. The child died during  delivery.  Marsh was subsequently charged under the  B.C. Medical Act. According to the Act,  which dates from 1886, it is illegal for  a person who is not a licensed doctor to  "practise medicine, surgery or midwifery."  Defence lawyer Peter Leask maintained that  Marsh is not and never has been a midwife.  Attending a birth, Leask argued, does not  make you a midwife. Leask also pointed  out that the law permits anyone to give  medical assistance during emergencies,  when no licensed doctor is available.  Judge Gilbert Hogg, who reserved judgment  until April 4, found that "nothing in the  Medical Act says what midwifery is ...  it's extraordinary to me that the Medical  Act does not contain a definition of midwifery."  Hogg further found dictionary definitions  "confusing".  Midwifery is a fully recognized profession  in many countries, including Britain and  Holland. But licensed midwives who come  to B.C. are not allowed to practise.  Margaret Marsh was a qualified doctor whose  license to practise was suspended in 1971.  In March 1980 she was found not guilty on  another charge relating to the death of  the Ambrey child, "criminal negligence  causing the death of a person."  The court could find no proven link between  the cause of death and anything Margaret  Marsh did or did not do.

UBC women's studies course falls under the axe  By Julie Wheelwright  At UBC, many students and faculty members  are angered by the arts dean's decision  to refuse funding for one of the two women's studies courses offered on that campus.  Women's Studies 222 is currently taught by  a sessional lecturer. But associate arts  dean Peter Remnant told a women's studies  coordination committee meeting mid-March  that there are no funds to continue paying  the lecturer for the next academic year.  If a full time faculty member does not  come forward to teach the course before  September, the course will not be offered.  And students and faculty are angry about  that possibility.  "The superficial reason given is that  there isn't money (for a lecturer) but I  think it goes deeper than that. The amount  of money they're talking about is peanuts,"  said Margaret Delgatty, a student currently enrolled in Women's Studies 222.  The students in the course sent a petition to the committee last month urging  the continuation of the course. And on  Feb 27 they met with the committee to express their concerns.  But Dalgetty says she doubts whether student concerns have been taken into consideration. "I'm not convinced that they  heard. We get all kinds of people very  politely nodding their heads and then  going away and doing something else."  After meeting with the students, the committee proposed that is chair should ask  the dean for lectureship funds if no other  proposal was forthcoming by March 13.  But at that March 13 meeting Remnant said  that no monies for a lectureship were  available.  According to committee member Lorraine  Weir: "Some members of the committee have  been trying for the last two years to have  the committee discuss the redefinition of  "Women's studies is now like a sharecropper working on other faculty3s property. "  Women's Studies 222. But the chair of the  committee has not been sympathetic to  undertaking that task."  Barb Blakely, women's studies professor  and committee member, said that the current structure of the program is another  problem because it was established as an  interdisciplinary course.  "Women's studies is now like the sharecropper working on other faculty's property. Some poeple with stronger voices have  been trying to answer these questions:  what is women's studies, where does feminism fit into it?"  But the committee's chair, Tannis Williams,  has refused to deal with these issues,  Blakely added, "Tannis^doesn't want to  discuss these things because they're too  controversial."  Blakely said Remnant is leaving the door  open to having three or four professors  teaching the course "which is what the stu  dents are opposed to," but is how it was  originally established.  David Mirhardy, an arts four student who  was elected to sit on the committee but  who has since resigned, said he would be  "really disturbed" if the course was not  offered next year. He said Remnant's message was that "it would be okay with the  dean if the course was not taught."  The students will be the real losers in  this situation, he added.  Williams and Remnant refused to comment on  the issue.  Blakely also charged the committee has  been ineffective in finding a full time  faculty member.  "Everything the dean says reflects much  more on the failure of the committee and  Tannis as the chair than anything else,"  she said.  Blakely added that the dean is trying to  hold the committee to agreements made when  the program began in 1973 but have not  been acted on for years. "We know how  things were set up at the beginning but  they haven't been acted upon for years.  What is the committee is asking is why  is the dean holding us to this faction?"  Committee member and Slavonic studies professor Barbra Monter said the importance  of Women's Studies 222 has been underestimated.  "At most major universities in North America women's studies has long been recognized as a fully fledged academic discipline. If I didn't feel it should be strongly represented at UBC then I wouldn't be  on the committee," she said.  - The Ubyssey  Spotty white paper issued by human rights commission  Recently the B.C. Human Rights Commission  came up with a white paper from their  legislative review committee. The paper,  now open to discussion by the public be-  for final submission to the minister of  labour, includes recommendations for  changes in the B.C. Human Rights Code.  Recommendations include:  — Forbidding discrimination on the basis  of physical handicap or sexual orientation.  — Stronger provisions against discrimination on the basis of sex: a review of  the federal experience with equal pay for  work of equal value.  — Prohibition of pension plan requirements for retirement at a particular age.  — More explicit prohibition of job-related sex harassment.  — No discrimination against tenants on  the basis of age, family composition (single parents), or source of income (those  on social assistance).  Women's groups have been critical of the  content and supporting arguments for most  of the proposed amendments to the Code.  Why have the mentally disabled not been  offered protection against discrimination  at the same time as the physically disabled?  Why, when discussing the standard of living of the physically disabled, does the  white paper recommend architectural alterations to buildings to ensure access when  no mention is made of income support, minimum income guarantee?  Support for sexual orientation protection  Lesbian and gay activists support the proposal to give protection against discrimin  ation on the basis of sexual orientation.  ■ This is an important step towards explicit  recognition of the discrimination faced  by lesbians and gays in employment, housing, custody and services.  But the white paper is not breaking any  tremendously new ground: remember that the  Gay Tide case against the Vancouver Sun's  refusal to run on its ads went all the way  to the Supreme Court of Canada under the  "reasonable cause" clause of the existing  Code.  And the supporting paragraphs to the sexual orientation recommendation are nothing  short of alarming.  Why those paragraphs about 'problem'  of children having lesbian, gay teachers  and camp counsellors . . . ?  Why  are two paragraphs devoted to the potential problems of children having lesbian  or homosexual teachers, camp counsellors,  etc?  The evidence is incontrovertible. With the  sexual abuse of children, 995* of the offenders are male; 90%  to 95%  of the victims are female.  Legislative review committee chair Harry  Crosbie, one of the drafters of the white  paper, says that very little concern has  been expressed at public meetings about  those supporting statements and he "doesn't  want to anticipate opposition."  Public relations officer Graham Hope told  Kinesis that he considers equal pay for  work of equal "a whole new concept." He  suggests that women would be more successful if they prepared themselves for non-  traditional jobs and pushed for affirmative  action. He calls comparing clerical and  labouring wages the equivalent of comparing  "apples and oranges." He also said he is  concerned over interference in the "free  labour market."  The job of the human rights branch is to  intervene in the "free" labour market when  discrimination has occurred. And getting  women into non-traditional jobs, inevitably  in small numbers, is not going to solve  problems for hundreds of thousands of women in ghettoized, underpaid jobs with no  possibility of promotion.  Chairperson of the legislative review committee, Harry Crosbie, told us he is meeting with federal human rights commissioners  in April to see if "we can come up with a  tighter wording" to the equal pay for work  of equal value area. Why, at this late  date, yet another review?  Proposals for the protection of women from  sexual harassment has been limited to job-  related incidents. Why have past complaints  around tenancy and public service areas  (such as teaching) been ignored? Alberta  has protection in these two areas already.  Graham Hope admits that these are areas of  increasing concern, with 25 to 30 complaints in 1980, compared to only two or  three in 1979. Women know that these are  ludicrously inadequate statistics, almost  unrelated to what is really happening in  educational institutions, apartment buildings and offices.  Finally, why does the commission recommend  that "all cases which cannot be settled  should go to a board of inquiry?" Why not  make this mandatory? ACROSS B.C.  Prince George's Native people  protest disgusting racism  Indians in Prince George are outraged at  the recent racist attitude shown by the  administration at a local hospital. In  December 1980, a disgusting and degrading  "mock" employment application form, for  "Indians Only", was circulated in the  Simon Fraser Hospital by administrator  Irene O'Brien. Beginning with an opening  comment, "It is not necessary to attach  photo since you all look alike," it is a  revolting slander of Native family life,  education, health and work.  Local 2181 of CUPE, representing the hospital staff which includes a number of  Native women, filed a grievance, demanding  an apology, or O'Brien's resignation.  The apology came, but with lots of disclaimers. Said O'Brien: "I'm not responsible for all the wrongdoings against  Native people across Canada. There isn't  a workplace in town where a joke isn't  passed around. A joke is a joke."  The local United Native Nations (UNN)  doesn't agree. President Ray Prince has  filed a complaint with the Human Rights  Branch, naming O'Brien: "We demand her  resignation. She's done a lot of damage.  The Native women were really discriminated  against. The whole issue has had a  chilling effect on Native employment."  To show their determination to get justice,  they set up a brief picket line at the  hospital in early January.  The UNN wants  EXAMPLES from "INDIAN APPLICATION FOR  EMPLOYMENT":  Approximate estimate of Income:  Theft                                             Relief  Check illnesses you may have had in the last year:  Education:  1st grade  2ndgrade_    3rd grade  None   a public inquiry, not private reconciliation, to expose the general racist treatment of Indians.  Most Native activists here have no illusions about the Human Rights Branch.  "They don't really defend people's rights.  They're not really doing their job and  they don't care."  Far from carrying out an active fight  against discrimination, the Human Rights  Branch attempts to mediate disputes. In  fact, the B.C. branch has held only two  public inquiries  in the last year. To  date, the local Prince George officer has  no decision on the UNN case.  The racist application form ironically  highlighted the abominable medical care  given to Indians.  Indian babies have a  mortality rate twice as high as other B.C.  babies.  Two years ago in Alert Bay, B.C., an 11-  year-old Native girl died of a ruptured  appendix, which had been diagnosed as the  "flu". In this coastal community, 56%  of the Indians are dead before they are 40,  and TB is 25 times higher than in the  general population. 0.       _ Agp(m  Three Native women outline  effect of Indian Act on their  lives  Charlotte, Alma and Norma are three women  who no longer have their status as Carrier  Indians because of section 12(1)(b) of  the Indian Act.    Aspen recently interviewed  the three at the Indian Friendship Centre  in Prince George.  Alma  Alma Larson was a member of the Omineca  Band which includes several small reserves  south of Burns Lake. She lived on the  Ootsa Lake reserve until 1950 when her  people were forced out by the rising waters behind the Kenney Dam. She married  an Indian man but in doing so, lost her  status.  Why? Her husband's mother had married a  non-Indian and so doing, had lost both her  own status and status for her nine children. The fact that her husband died when  the kids were still young changed nothing  in the eyes of Indian Affairs. She  raised her family on welfare, without any  of the financial support to which she  would have been entitled from them, had  she still been, officially, an Indian.  Norma  Norma Shephert was once also a member of  the Omineca Band, although she was raised  in Houston rather than on a reserve. She  was a band member until 1969 when she  married, and received a letter from Indian  Affairs telling her she no longer had  status. At the time she thought, "Oh well,  if you don't want me, okay!"  But now she regrets her position.  "I  would like to be recognized for who I am.  I still have a lot of relatives on the  reserve." Norma was raised by her grandmother to speak Carrier and to value Indian culture. She would like to carry on  the family traditions with her two sons.  Getting her status back would mean a lot  to her.  Charlotte  Charlotte Euverman lost her Moricetown  Band status as a girl, reacquired it  through marriage, then lost it again in a  second marriage. Her father voluntarily  gave up his status in order to acquire the  blue enfranchisement cart that enabled him  to buy liquor, enter a beer parlour and  also to vote — the only way to get these  rights of Canadian citizenship prior to  the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights.  Charlotte's mother wasn't consulted, but  was automatically 'enfranchised', as were  her children.  "As far as I'm concerned,  that (offering blue cards) was when all  the trouble with liquor and family breakdowns started for Indian people." Charlotte 's daughter by her first marriage  has Indian status, because her father did.  So too, for a time, did Charlotte. But  when she remarried a non-Indian, she lost  her status for the second time in her life.  Indian Act changes must return status  All three women felt that the Indian Act  should be changed, and that it should  retroactively return status to all those  women and children affected. But they  were not aware of whether any bands in the  area had taken a position on this, or had  applied to the government to have their  members exempted from s. 12(l)(b). And it  is no wonder they are not aware. They  are excluded from the very decision-making  process that might change the Act! Because they are no longer members of any  band, they have no access to negotiations  between the DIA and the National Indian  Brotherhood or individual bands.  As for the relationship of Indian women  and children regaining status to the question of land claims and aboriginal rights,  Charlotte and the others declined comment.  But it seems clear that if settlements-  are to be negotiated in part based on population, the Indian people have much to  gain by any move that would increase the  number of Indian people who will be  officially counted. But then the pie  would have to split more, ways. Perhaps  that accounts for the reluctance of some  Indian organizations to take up the cause  of these women. 0  Nanaimo Transition House has  everything but the bucks  The Vancouver Island Haven Society announced in early March that a shelter for  battered women has been acquired in Nanaimo. A lease for the rental of the house  from the City of Nanaimo was signed in  January this year.  But the house remains closed and a facility that is vitally necessary for the  women of Nanaimo is still unavailable.  The- reason is money and without money the  shelter cannot open. The society has  been negotiating with the ministry of  human resources for funding to staff and  equip the house but its application has  yet to be approved.  The Haven Society began servies to abused  women in October, 1978. The first statistical report in June, 1979 showed it  had been contacted by 60 women with 91  children who required information and  shelter. Such women have been referred to  the Transition House in Victoria or to  private emergency shelter homes. The  need for a permanent house to provide this  service rapidly became evident.  A federal report, Wife Battering in  Canada:  The Vicious Circle,  reported last  year that 500,000 women in Canada are  battered by their husbands. And half of  these women do not have access to a transition house or hostel that accepts  battered women.  Nanaimo will remain in the latter half of  this statistic unless sufficient funds are  found to open the house.  The society is now appealing to the public,  other organizations and women's groups for  support and donations. If you can help  ... in money, in time or simply support,  write to the Vancouver Island Haven Society at Box 311, Nanaimo. V9R 5L3.  Telephone: 753-1021. $  Rupert Transition House  opened March 8  The good news from Prince Rupert is that  the endless lobbying has paid off. Ministry of Human Resources finally allocated  $93,000. for a transition house and the  grand opening took place March 8..  The emergency shelter/transition house in  Fort St. John opened its doors in January  of this year. But negotiations are still  under way for the Fort Nelson transition  house.  In other northern news, the Northern B.C.  Advisory Council for the Alaska Highway  Pipeline is currently developing its  training and person-power requirements for  the pipeline construction so that courses  and programming can begin at Northern  Lights College, Fort Nelson.  Eleanor Sumner is a member of the advisory  council and is raising the feminist issues. ACROSS CANADA  Kidnapped woman escapes  family, returns to Quebec  Dalila Maschino was a student in Montreal  in 1978 when her brother, a wealthy  Algerian businessman, kidnapped her. He  drugged her and placed her on his private  jet at Dorval. Her crime: she had married  in defiance of her family's wishes.  Maschino was returned to Algeria where she  was tortured, beaten and made to tell  journalists that she had returned home  voluntarily. She was then forced to marry  the man to whom she had been promised at  birth.  Thirty-four months later, she managed to  slip away from her jailer-husband when they  were on a trip to Geneva. She made her  way to Paris where she was joined by her  husband by choice, Denis Maschino. At the  end of February, the two returned to  Montreal.  Montreal police say they have "sufficient  proof" to bring charges against the  brother, but that "the final say" on  whether to lay the complaint will be up to  Dalila. £  Sexual orientation protection  won't get a mention  Lesbians and homosexuals won't have the  same rights as heterosexuals in Canada's  new constitution.  When Sven Robinson, NDP, moved that the  constitutional committee explicitly  prohibit discrimination in employment,  accomodation and public services on the  basis of sexual orientation, marital  status and political belief, the motion  was defeated 22-2.  Justice Minister Jean Chretien didn't want  sexual orientation cited as a category in  the constitution because, he says, it has  an imprecise definition. And "we don't  want to create a political debate."  PC Jack Epp explained that the committee  simply could not concern itself with  "every barnacle, every eavestrough."  "We're not talking about barnacles and  eavestroughs," responded Robinson. "We're  talking about human beings." 0_  Women apprentices hired at  Montreal's CNR  Women have won an important victory in  the struggle for skilled jobs which are  traditionally reserved for men. In December, six women began working for Canadian  National Railways, in Montreal as apprentices.  The good news was made public on March 2  at a press conference in the headquarters  of the Quebec Federation of Labour (FTQ).  The press conference was chaired by Fer-  nand Daoust, the secretary-general of the  FTQ. Two representatives of the women  explained how they worked with the group  Action travail des femmes (Work Action  for Women) to win their jobs.  In a press communique, Daoust declared,  "the FTQ salutes the courage of these  women who had to struggle for two years  before winning a settlement. The settlement has historic significance for the  desexualization of work. The FTQ reiterates its support for all women who are  struggling to improve their access to  the labour market. This is the only  really effective way to bring about significant changes in women's condition. We  encourage women to continue the struggle.  The example of CN women shows that-it is  possible to win."  Margaret Manwaring, an apprentice-electrician at CN, emphasized that, "We are  among the first women to be hired.at CN  in so-called nontraditional jobs since the  second world war. Together with us, there  aren't even ten women with these kinds of  jobs at CN ... We are confident that our  case will serve as an example to all women  who want to get out of the "feminine" job  ghetto — poorly paid, often less-interesting jobs.  "We hope that Canadian National will establish a program of hiring women in every  area of work. Such a program would be a  model for all those companies who have up  to now refused to hire what is potentially  half of the work force — women."  The six women, together with a seventh  who decided not to work at CN, made a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights  Commission accusing CN of practicing a  Martha Tabor/LNS  policy of discriminatory hiring by refusing  to hire them.  An inquiry carried out by the commission  confirmed systematic sexual discrimination  at CN. After five months of conciliation,  an agreement was signed on February 4.,  The seven women received a monetary compensation of more than $71,000. equivalent  to their lost wages (less what they had  earned elsewhere in the meantime).  The women have not won retroactive seniority as they demanded. But several clauses  in the agreement go in this direction.  The agreement creates another precedent.  The women have been accepted in the  apprenticeship program during a period of  major layoffs, including the closing of  CN Express.  They see the victory as a first step towards an affirmative action program for  the hiring end integration of women in all  the trades at CN. A proposal to this  effect made by Action travail des femmes  is presently in conciliation between the  human rights commission and CN.  The representatives of the women explained  to the press that'their victory was the  fruit of considerable support for the  struggle of women for jobs of their choice.  A similar struggle of women at CN in  Toronto and Winnipeg was supported by several unions and the New Democratic Party.  This contributed in a major way to the  victory in Montreal. 0_  - Socialist Voice  Women who've left their stamp  on Canadian society  Is International Women's Day, a celebration revived-in'Canada by the women's  movement, seeping into national consciousness?  This year, Canada Post, avowedly "in honour  of four Canadian feminists" released some  new 17 cent postage stamps "at a special  ceremony to be held in the Senate on March  4, four days before International Women's  Day."  Curious about these four women?  Henrietta Edwards  Henrietta Edwards was born in Montreal in  1849. She and her sister founded the  Working Girls' Association there in 1875.  It offered a boarding house, a reading  room, classes and meal services. The  sisters supported the association with  their own money. After her marriage,  Edwards lived in Alberta. There she campaigned for equal rights, mother's allowance and rights for women.  Through many years of research, she became  an expert on Canadian Alberta laws affecting women and children. Even lawyers and  judges consulted her on these subjects.  Edwards partook in the "Five Persons Case",  together with Nellie McClung, Louise  McKinney, Emily Murphy and Irene Parlby.  The case confirmed that women were "persons" and had the right to sit in the  Canadian Senate.  Louise McKinney  Louise McKinney was born in Frankville,  Ontario in 1868. After her marriage she  moved to Alberta where she worked hard for  the Women's Christian Temperance Union  (WCTU) and for women's suffrage, believing  that once women had the vote, conditions  would improve for immigrants and women.  After her defeat in the 1921 election,  she continued working for the WCTU, took  part in the creation of the United Church  of Canada, and along with four others,  initiated the five Persons' Case.  Idola Saint-Jean  Idola Saint-Jean was-horn in Montreal in  1880. A French language teacher, she  strove to gain the vote for women in  Quebec provincial elections. She helped  found the Provincial Franchise Committee  in 1922. Upon splitting with it, she  founded "L'Alliance Canadienne pour le  Vote des Femmes du Quebec". She also  protested women's inequality before the  law. At that time, Quebec women could not  even control their own bank accounts. In  1930 she shattered tradition by running in  a federal election. Saint-Jean took many  trips to Quebec City to persuade provincial legislators to grant women the vote,  though she suffered much rude behaviour in  the process. The right was finally granted  in 1940.  Emily Stowe  Dr. Emily Stowe, the first Canadian woman  doctor, was born in South Norwich, Ontario,  in 1831. She began teaching at age fifteen. Later, she graduated from teacher's  college with high honours and became  Canada's first woman school principal.  After marriage and three children, Stowe  decided to study medicine. She felt  women patients needed women doctors. She  herself needed a higher income to support  her children and ailing husband. She  received her degree from a United States  medical school, in 1868 and, because it  was difficult for a woman to get a licence,  practiced without one in Toronto until  1880. Stowe crusaded vigorously for  equal rights for women, especially voting  rights. She founded Canada's first woman  suffrage society. Q Kinesis April'81  ACROSS CANADA  A personal appraisal of the conference  NAC: an opportunity to listen to each other on a national level  By Pat Filler  When I went to Ottawa for NAC's Annual  conference I didn't know much about the  National Action Committee on the Status of  Women. I understood that it was a national umbrella organization of women's groups  whose function primarily was to lobby the  federal government. I also knew that there  was not much enthusiasm for NAC from many  women's groups in B.C. and that the feeling  was apparently reciprocated. I was  puzzled by this.  As women living,in a sexist, patriarchal  society, we are all too familiar with the  problems that we share, regardless of our  class and economic status. Superimposed  on these are the additional difficulties  that beset a woman if she is poor, a  mother, a lesbian, of a different cultural  background, handicapped or in possession  of skills that are not rewarded financially, (worse still, any combination of these)  Every woman is special, and her difficulties necessarily special to her, and it  seems important to me that we listen to  each other's stories and be understanding  and supportive of one another. Locally,  we do: we know that we can.  NAC seemed to me to present the structure  that would enable us to do so at the national level; and more, by demonstrating  our unity through lobbying.  I went to  Ottawa to find out if my idealism was  mere 'pie in the sky'.  Many are not involved in our movement  I arrived in time for happy hour on Friday, and it was just that. I was warmly  greeted by women I had never met before,  and the exchange was open and meaningful.  It did not feel like a cocktail circuit,  although the manner of dress might have  been misleading. The opening speech was  by Alexa McDonough, leader of the Nova  Scotia party of the NDP, and this comment  from her seemed particularly relevant:  "Even though most women remain regrettably  uninvolved in the organized activity and  the institutionalized politics of the  women's movement, there are many reasons  for that, which deserve and demand our  continuous understanding. That's not to  say they are uninvolved in the women's  movement. All women in a sexist society  are necessarily on a day to day basis, just  by virtue of living out their lives, involved in the struggles of the women's  movement — self-evident but often overlooked in our field.  We must not treat women as outsiders  Our job is to ensure that women feel  supported in those struggles and become  better able to choose active over unwitting participation. The extent to which  we make women feel like outsiders is a  measure of our failure as well as our  lack of real accountability to them."  Saturday morning started out with mini-  platform speeches by the nominees for the  new executive, followed by workshops which  addressed the operation of NAC: funding,  membership, editorial, and media relations.  Time was very limited, and as all workshops were pertinent to all members, they  were held simultaneously, and then repeated as the workshop leaders changed  rooms. This made the most of the time  available, but unfortunately we still felt  the constraint of insufficient time.  The organizers stipulated three resolutions per workshop, but this was unacceptable, and in fact nine resolutions came  out of the funding workshop.  The afternoon was devoted to workhops on  pensions, social services, employment,  justice, and the constitution, with a  special 'workshop' on the advisory council.  As it is still impossible for one to be  in more than one place at any given time,  it was just as well that there were three  delegates from VSW.  It was a hard day's work, but I emerged  at the end of it stimulated by the discussions that had taken place", and encouraged by the resolutions that emerged.  Saturday evening was relaxation time, and  we were entertained after dinner by "The  Red Rose Review", a feminist group that  humourously portrayed women in roles  familiar to us all. This was followed by  a special presentation ceremony, in  which a jumbo size pacifier was awarded to  the male turkey-of-the-year, Harry Hayes,  with special mention to all those who had  for women from grass root connections.  This was very encouraging, and I am  pleased to say that we have one such woman  as our regional representative for this  year — Alicia Lawrence from Vernon.  Lobbying was well-planned  Sunday evening was spent honing our questions for the political parties the following day. We were to "practice" on the NDP,  go on to the Conservatives, and finally  tackle the Liberals.  It was a good strategy and each "question" woman had a backup,  a woman with indepth knowledge of the  subject.  The question and answer periods  tried so hard for the coveted award.  Special tribute was paid to Kay McPherson,  who retires this year after many years of  service to women through NAC.  Sunday was back to business with an agenda  that included the presentation of resolutions arrived at the previous day;  discussion and voting thereon. These  resolutions were to form NAC policy for  the year, and I was proud of the work and  energy that had gone into them.  Two events marred an otherwise constructive day. One was the resignation of the  Federation de Femmes de Quebec upon the  endorsement by NAC of the Ad Hoc Committee  on the Constitution's request for the  resignation of Lloyd Axworthy, and for an  outside enquiry into the Advisory Council.  It was regrettable that once again male  politics should divide us.  The other event that was distressing was  the apparent trial of Lynn McDonald, consequent upon a vote of non-confidence that  was passed by the executive against her  last September. I was quite ignorant of  the issues involved and it seemed inappropriate to be addressing the matter in a  (very) public forum, as an item on the  business agenda.  The election results demonstrated a support  were times so that all the questions  would be addressed, and speakers were  politely but firmly asked to apply themselves to the question; preferably with a  "yes" or "no" answer.  This task proved surprisingly difficult  for some Members, one of whom even had  difficulty with the question (whether he  would vote for or against a woman's right  to choose on abortion).  We "came across" very strongly as a body  of women who knew exactly what we wanted,  and I sensed the effectiveness of a large  organization such as NAC in wearing down  the opposition by our very relentlessness  and abrasiveness.  It was an exhausting weekend, but enlight-  ning and encouraging.  Lobbying is not a substitute for local  action. But the work of our local women's  organizations need more recognition and  more funding, in order to meet the needs  of the women for whom they exist, and for  these reasons I see it as necessary to  join forces and lobby through NAC. NAC is  our national voice.  As drops of water we can be brushed away.  But as part of the ocean swell we shall  erode those indomitable rocks, and nothing  can stop us.  Q  Women's voluntary CPP contributions inequitable  Allowing homemakers to contribute voluntar-  tain a full-time job outside the home,  ily to the Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) is  an "inequitable and piecemeal" approach to  the pension needs of Canadian women.  Jean Wood, newly-elected president of the  National Action Committee on the Status  of Women (NAC) says that the Liberal Party  proposals will benefit only the small number of Canadian women who had enough disposable income to participate.  Says Wood, "Only the low percent of women  whose husbands earn high salaries will be  able to contribute. This scheme will perpetuate female dependency. If the husband  does not contribute, the woman receives  no benefits."  In addition to the fact that the proposal  would not remedy the inequities in the  present pension system, it also could  lead to a situation where a low income  working woman would receive less in pensions income than a woman who did not re-  "This tactic will not solve the pension  problems for women," Wood concluded. The  facts are that only 3A%  of wage earning women workers are covered by private pension  plans; that in 1976 those who were covered  received $2,212 on average per annum from  those plans and that two-thirds of Canadians over 65 living below the poverty line  are women.  In light of these facts, NAC says that it  is calling for a comprehensive plan of  action to address the needs of women for  both private and public pension schemes.  As a start, NAC supports publicly funded  pensions for non-wage earning homemakers  and the inclusion of the drop-out provision  in CPP.  NAC presented it recommendations to the  ministry of health and welfare at a pensions conference on March 31. 10       Kinesis April'81  SURVIVAL  March against nukes April 25,organize April 26  All forms of technologically-produced  radiation are carcinogenic and mutagenic.  They are dangerous to the health and survival of all living things.  Studies now show increases in spontaneous  abortions, infant death and mutations in  the human and animal population in the  vicinity of the nuclear plant at Three  Mile Island. Basically, nuclear power is  an expensive, dangerous energy source,  and'its products are the ammunition of  nuclear weaponry.  In 1981 the U.S. will spend 192 billion  dollars on the military, which will be  matched by the Russians in the most insane of competitions that could lead to  what the U.S. military appropriately refers  to as MAD - Mutually Assured Destruction.  The election of Ronald Reagan as president of the U.S., running on a platform of  militarism, brings us even closer to this  possibility.  In Washington State there are nuclear  plants, radioactive waste dumps, and a  nuclear submarine base. Here in Canada,  we supply the raw materials and technology  indiscriminately to many nations under  the guise of assisting development of  "underdeveloped" nations.  Not only is highly centralized nuclear  technology not appropriate for most  predominantly rural Third World economies,  but it also keeps them indebted to the  industrialized countries. And it leads  to the spread of nuclear weapons.  India,  for example, detonated a nuclear bomb in  1Q74 with the "waste" products of a Canadian built Candu reactor.  In British Columbia, uranium is still  extracted along with other ores. Tons of  radioactive tailings are dumped into the  sea or left to blow in the wind, endangering the lives of workers and others  living in the area, disrupting the food  chain and destroying the environment.  Workers in the nuclear industry face  serious health hazards, especially the  increased risk of cancer.  There are nuclear warheads in Comox on  Vancouver Island. Here on the Lower  Mainland, B.C. Hydro is pushing through  the Cheekeye-Dunsmuir transmission line,  a line with such enormous capacity it is  suspected of being a link between planned  nuclear plants on Vancouver Island and  electricity markets in the U.S.  As we were at last year's anti-nuke rally. This April 25 it's time to do it again  These are some of the many reasons why it ,  is important for us to join together to  make our presence known on April 25 and  26. A coalition of concerned groups and  individuals is planning a march and rally  for April 25, followed by a day of workshops, audiovisual presentations, and  organizational meetings on April 26th.  We would like to see a big turn-out from  the women's movement as there was last  year.  The nuclear issue is a concern for all of  us. The forces of capitalism and patriarchy that perpetuate violence and oppression of women are the same forces that are  threatening devastating violence against  all of life. The nuclear mentality is  one of control rather than co-operation,  of oppression rather than self-determination, of amassing profits rather than  meeting human needs.  There is an interlocking connection between the nuclear issue and sexism,  racism, the abuse of power and privilege,  capitalism, imperialism and the misuses  of technology.  For further information about the April  25-26 action, call the Coalition at  734-8915 or Women Against Nuclear Technology at 255-0523.

Monetary issues had been settled  early in negotiations between the union,  Service, Office and Retail Workers Union  of Canada (SORWUC) and the Guild. The "  biggest bone of contention had been working conditions; the strike was the workers'  response to a balking management.  Four and a half days later, the Guild  workers had a first contract that stands  as a victory for clerical workers, particularly in reference to the working  environment.  Health and Safety guarantees  The contract stipulates that the employer  must guarantee employees a safe and healthy workplace, that the employer must  provide and maintain, at no cost to the  employees, protective clothing and equipment and that the worker can refuse to do  work or operate equipment where she has  reasonable grounds to believe that it  would be unsafe or unhealthy to do so,  without loss of pay.  While the Workers Compensation Act of B.C.  provides regulations for worker health  and safety, this contract explicitely  establishes working conditions for Guild  employees without requiring them to deal  with the Workers' Compensation Board  bureaucracy. Furthermore, Guild workers  can present data directly to management  to support the fulfillment of these clauses rather than depend solely on WCB  standards which all too often fall short  of providing maximum protection to workers  No more coffeemaking  In the office, for example, hazards from  chemical contaminants in the air from  correcting fluids and copying machines  are unacknowledged or underregulated 'by  Board Regulations as well as by the  Ministry of Labour's Occupational Employment Branch.  Inadequate ventilation in  sealed buildings, where clerical workers  mainly spend their days, has not yet been  addressed by any of the organizations  whose mandate is to protect workers'  health, nor have the hazards of fluoure-  scent lighting or poor seating. (Write  Kinesis for a copy of February '81 issue  supplement, "Clerical Work is Dangerous  to Your Health")  Another clause, dealing with workers'  personal rights, stipulates that employees  will not be asked or required to do any  work of a personal nature for the employer, and that the employer shall not harass  or interfere- in the work of the employees.  Harassment is defined in the contract as  "any sexually oriented behaviour that  undermines a woman's job performance and  threatens her economic livelihood. The  threat may be overt or implicit."  This extraordinary contract is a source of  encouragement and support to clerical  workers everywhere. And its progressive  health and safety language reinforces the  struggles of workers in all fields for  protection on the job.

Richards, a 32-year-old Native Indian, was  in Oakalla awaiting trial because she  couldn't make bail. Thirteen days before  her suicide, she had slashed her wrists.  But she was never given any psychiatric  attention.  Despite the fact that suicide is the leading cause of death in prisons, Oakalla  staff have no special training in suicide  prevention.  Oakalla women's unit warden Marie Peacock  told the inquest that when Maureen Richards  slashed her wrists, she was put into a  "quiet place." That turns out to be solitary confinement.  "That's what we use now because that's all  we have," Peacock said. Slashings are not  "uncommon" in prison, the warden added.  Put in the hole  According to Peacock, the usual procedure  with women attempting suicide is a referral from the prison doctor to a psychiatrist.  At the time she slashed her wrists, Maureen  Richards was suffering from the DT's. After  five days in solitary confinement, she was  taken to Vancouver General Hospital due  to severe stomach problems.  The prison doctor received no official report from VGH. He also said that records  indicated that Richards had not been given  prescribed medication for two days in a  row.  And the doctor temporarily on duty in the  men's section of the prison said he did  not make the referral because he didn't  think Maureen Richards was "serious" about  killing herself. He thought it might be  an attempt "to manipulate" him.  There was no nurse on duty when Richards  hanged herself with a nylon rag. The staff  who attempted resuscitation had had no  recent first aid training.  After hearing three days' testimony to  the appalling medical neglect which culminated in Maureen Richard's death, the  jury recommended that:  — Staff be given formal suicide prevention and first aid training, instead of  relying on training on-the-job;  — Prisoners suffering from emotional problems or alcohol or drug withdrawal be  placed in a proper facility, not in solitary confinement.  — Procedures be established so that the  staff can communicate with each other  about the medical condition of prisoners  and that hospital records be made available to staff.  — The officially-appointed citizens' advisory committee be re-structure to prevent being "influenced" by Oakalla officials.  Community groups will  continue to poster  Postering is here to stay in Vancouver. It  won't matter what the court rules in the  recent challenge to the anti-poster bylaw.  Community groups have no access to any  other means of advertising. We need to  poster and we intend to keep on doing it.  This case was strongly put by Rape Relief  spokesperson Joni Miller on March 2 when  she appeared as a defence witness in the  trial of Don Stewart, who is charged with  . having put up a poster last September.  Miller told the court, "The information  we put on the street is absolutely crucial  and we will continue to poster."  Also appearing in Stewart's defence were  representatives from the Vancouver Folk  Music Festival and Tamahnous Theatre, two  of the 85 community groups which have publicly opposed the city bylaw. Susan Payne  of Tamahnous explained that newspaper ads  are at least five times more expensive  than posters.  Stewart's poster was one which explicitly  opposed the city bylaw. Under that new  bylaw, people convicted of postering are  liable.to a $2,000 fine or two months in  prison.  Cheekeye-Dunsmuir activists  sentenced  Some otherwise law-abiding citizens can  "fall into lawlessness over issues that  are not as important as they think them  to be."  So pronounced B.C. Supreme Court Justice  Allan McEachern on sentencing the Cheekeye Dunsmuir defendants March 18.  The seven were sentenced for their involvement in the Cheekeye-Dunsmuir protest,  against B.C. Tel's ambition to link the  mainland with Vancouver Island with a 500  kilovolt transmission line, which could  eventually connect Canada and the U.S.  with future nuclear plants on the Island.  Carl Rising Moore was fined $500 and received a six-month suspended sentence.  Three others, including Paula Laurie, got  a fine of $100 with 14 day suspended sentences. The case against Susan Rising  Moore was adjourned.  Attend the April 15 evaluation of IWD '81 activities  The public evaluation meeting for the  International Women's Day activities  on March 7 will be held on April 15 at  the CRS warehouse, 1239 Odulum Drive, in  the upstairs meeting room at 7:30 until  9:30.  The committee organizing this year's IWD  activities was made up of feminists and  interested women who responded to the call  to meetings. The first meeting was held  on January 15 1981, and we held several  subsequent meetings. The committee was  made up of a few autonomous feminists  a few socialist feminists, and a few members of vanguard parties. Only a few of  the women participating had had any experience of organizing IWD events.  The committee has held two internal evaluation meetings and what follows is a  summary of the criticisms of the IWD activities which were raised in these meetings. Some of these criticisms came from  women outside the committee and some were  internal.  We started far too late to organize for  IWD 81. This meant that there were many  problems which arose because we did not  have sufficient time. We did attract a  large number of people, but our outreach  could still have been broader.  Publicity and outreach should have been  done by separate committees. The committee never decided on a name for itself,  with the consequence that we could not  name who we spoke for.  Although it was generally agreed that the  rally was successful, some felt that the  location was not visible enough.  We did not make enough media contacts  with radio and television. We did not  organize women-only events. Our poster  did not address the 'international' part  of IWD. Childcare at the dance operated  under constraints of space and inexperience and was not respectful of the needs  of children as a result. Some people  were concerned about some of the music  at the rally, that it was not positive  in spirit.  If we are going to have mixed dances,  there must be some political content to  continue education and outreach about the  issues around which the activities are  organized. We did not set a date for a  public evaluation before the events.  We decided to send thank-you letters to  those people and groups who helped with  organizing the IWD activities in some  way.  We also decided that some of the members of  this year's planning committee should take  responsibility for calling a meeting in  November to begin planning for IWD 1982.  Seven women volunteered to be on this committee.  Two women were appointed signing officers  for the IWD money account. We made some  decision about what to do with the money  raised at this year's IWD benefit. $750  will be retained to cover expenses of next  year's rally/march and so oh. The remaining funds (after expenses) will be divided  three ways: donations will be made to a  women's groups in El Salvador, to Kinesis  newspaper, and to the Vancouver Welfare  Rights Coalition.  These groups were chosen from over a dozen suggestions. We wanted to donate our  money to groups who were daily addressing  the issues relating to the theme of this  year's activities. We wanted to make the  donations large enough so that they would  make a significant difference to each of  the groups.  We are holding a public evaluation meeting  so that women in Vancouver who have criticisms or suggestions to give about International Women's Day activities in Vancouver will have an opportunity to come forward.  Please come to the evaluation meeting. If  you are interested in working on IWD for  next year, and cannot come to the meeting,  drop us a line care of Kinesis. Kinesis April '81  INTERNATIONAL  Kinesis April'81        13  Soviet exile discusses the rise of feminism in the USSR  By Jan De Grass  Tatyana Mamonova,  exiled Soviet feminist,  visited Vancouver as part of an internationally-organized speaking tour.    She is  editor of the Almanac,   the first feminist  journal to appear in the Soviet Union for  fifty years.    I4omonova was forced into  exile by the Soviet authorities after the  first ten hand-typed copies of the Almanac  in November,   1979.  She spoke with Jan DeGrass of Kinesis and  Hilda Thomas of Priorities.  JAN: What influences in your life raised  your consciousness? How did you become a  feminist?  TATYANA:  I consider myself a born feminist, but certainly there were conditions  that helped form my views.  I was born  during the war, not in Leningrad itself,  but in a village close to it.  I was  born on December 10th, 1943 and I was the  only child born in the village at that  time.  December 10th is also the Day of  Human Rights in the Soviet Union. On  that day in 1979 I was hauled in by the  KGB and warned that if I did not stop  working on the almanac I could expect a  terrible fate.  Heavy work, many funerals  As the only child in a village full of  women, my whole body remembers the love  I received from them - these women who  were left behind. This influenced my  development and my opinion of women.  I witnessed women performing all the heavy  work of the village and witnessed all the  funerals.  The atmosphere was one of great S  love and suffering. j<  I  I lived my adult life in Leningrad and ^  very early on I began to have discussions fc.  with my own father, a jurist. Despite the -o  fact that he was in a profession which -a  strives for justice for all people, I £  noted that he wasn't being understanding g  or fair to everyone, including my mother.  ^  JAN: Was it difficult to meet or get to  know other feminists in the Soviet Union?  T:  I had opportunities to travel for  study and research and I can't say that it  was easy to find one woman who would call  herself a feminist. This is easily explained by the fact that the society cultivates a negative attitude towards  feminism.  I came to the conclusion that  many women are feminists and don't know  that they are feminists.  JAN: I know that alcoholism is rampant in  the Soviet Union and that this probably  contributes to crimes of violence against  women.     Is the state taking any steps to  prevent it?  T: There are separate departments affiliated with clinics to combat alcoholism.  The press spends time on the state struggle  against alcohol, yet all we can see are  more and more liquour stores being opened.  JAN: Aren't women now drinking more,  too?  T: Soviet women are identifying with men  more and more and in adapting to a patriarchal society they are also adopting their  habits.  I believe that these women who  drink under stress are to be defended;  their patterns need not be imitated, but  defended, because these women are censured  by society. A man who drinks is a real  man, whereas a woman who drinks and is seen  tottering on a street is called a prostitute  or worse.  J: I have travelled in the Soviet Union  and was told that prostitution did not  exist.  T: (Laughs) You shouldn't have asked;  you should have gone to look in the train  stations.  J: In the Almanac you've given us some  pretty shocking statistics about abortions.  What justification does the state give for  allowing abortions and not promoting  contraception?  T: This contradiction can be explained by  noting that in a socialist state bourgeois  classes do exist. When people are starving for meat the bourgeoisie are eating  red caviar.  HILDA:    I'm sorry. . I don't see how that  explains anything.  T: It's quite an ironic interpretation,  but if one is to speak more seriously -  it's difficult to see any kind of logic  to that contradiction. We're talking about  a patriarchial society, characterized by  its phallocratic notions. Any resources  that go for contraceptive materials are  very often channelled into the military,  for more weapons.  Also, there is a complete lack of sexual  culture. Many women simply do not know  anything about their bodies or birth control methods and take what they can get.  HILDA: In the 60's there was prudish  attitude towards sex, at least officially,  in the school system.    Is that still true  in the 70 's?  T: There is a puritanical attitude to this  day and it's become more hypocritical.  While this puritanical attitude exists,the  partocracy, officials even, are involved  with young girls of light frivolous behaviour. (Ed.note: partocracy is a new  word for the party bureaucracy)  The only people benefiting from the sexual  revolution are members of the partocracy.  Another example of the hypocrisy is the  frequent announcement by the state that  there is no homosexuality ih the Soviet  Union!  HILDA: The woman who visited us from  Albania said that homosexuality was a  Western problem!  T: How naive!  J: As you may know Vancouver is almost  completely strike-bound. Among the issues  the trade unions are addressing is that of  narrowing the gap between women's and men's  salaries. What is the role of trade unions  in the Soviet Union and would they stand up  for issues like equal pay for equal work?  T: Official state trade unions in the  Soviet Union don't provide any benefits  either to women or men. Officially, there  cannot be any distinctions between women's  and men's salaries. This, of course, is  not so. The question of free trade unions  and the obvious gaps between women and men  are not discussed neither in the offical  press nor is it raised by men in the general dissident movement.  For example, a Ukrainian, Natalia Lesnich-  enko was actively gathering materials relating to the free trade union movement.  She hoped to publish it in the almanac.  Her materials and typewriter were confiscated.  J: At your press conference you mentioned  a new Polish womens movement.    Are they  getting support from the Polish trade  unions?  T: I doubt very much that they get support  from the free trade unions. There is a  misconception around the Soviet dissident  .-.lovement and the free trade union movement.  There is an assumption made that the present Soviet womens movement derives from  the general dissident movement. In fact,  women are forced to leave the unions as  their issues always get secondary treatment.  J: Could you give us your first,  candid  impressions of the womens movement in North  America?  T: They have been very pleasant. Especially the rally for International Womens  Day in Edmonton. There were lots of people  there and I was moved to tears.  I hope  that one day in my life I will be able to  put something like that on in the Soviet  Union.  J: Soviet women coming to North America  may get an inaccurate picture of what to  expect, and their opinion could change  after they arrive.    It's curious to me that  when you arrived in the States you went to  Ms.  Magazine.    To many western feminists  Ms.  is not representative.    In fact,  it has  sold out.  T: I've heard this said.  I must say that  at Ms. I met many wonderful women - genuine  feminists. Among them was Robin Morgan who  accompanied me on my tour of the States.  The Ms. organized speaking tours were very  well-attended.  Lenin, Ms, make concessions  Also, working with Ms. magazine didn't prevent me from meeting with other feminist  journalists like members of Off Our Backs.  I met many, many women with a variety of  platforms and views, lesbians, anti-militaristic feminists and Ms. enabled me to  contact them.  I understand your severity towards Ms. magazine. I,too, disagree with the large  number of cigarette and wine ads. I don't  think this has anything to do with feminism. But I do believe in something similar  to the New Economic Policy that was intro  duced by Lenin himself.  It was done with  the motivation that sometimes you must  make concessions to the society that you  are working with in order to be able to  have the ultimate victory. I believe that  this type of new economic policy has helped  Ms. They do have a subscription of three  million and this can only be to their benefit.  HILDA: My objection to Ms.   has nothing to  do with cigarette ads.     Their feminism is  of a bourgeois kind; it lacks analysis,  has no class base; it feeds into a kind of  careerism among women, who want to achieve  success in a male-dominated society.  T:  I do disagree with your remarks because  I, myself, have been accused of this same  bourgeois feminism by the Spartacists who  put out the journal Woman and Revolution.  An article in it, in connection with my  speaking tour, said that while I was  still in the Soviet Union I was conducting  a conversation with KGB officers and suggested in all seriousness that I would be  presenting myself as a candidate for membership in the government. My suggestion  was later turned against me by the Spartacists.  H: Were you aware of the tradition of  Soviet women in the early days of the revolution?    For instance,  Kollontai and  Zetkin?    Was it part of your teaching in  school?    Did it have any influence on you  as a feminist and a socialist?  T: The women you mentioned are noted in  history books and speeches as builders of  the revolution. Unfortunately they get  only a mention and only in connection with  revolutionary womens' celebrations. As a  rule nobody today remembers or mentions  the names of 19th century women like Sera  Sophia Peryovskaya who was involved in an  assassination attempt against the Czar and  was executed. They are mentioned only in  passing.  Nowhere will it be said that Alexandra  Kollontai was a big feminist or when women  like Rosa Luxembourg are mentioned it will  always be mentioned in the context of the  male leaders of that time and after them.  They are not called feminists because the  very word is not in circulation.  It is said that the Soviet revolution made  women happy. But every Soviet woman asks  herself the same question: "Why am I unhappy?"  J: You've said you hope to return to the  Soviet Union. Is that realistic? Do you  mean after social change has taken place?  Or do you mean to go back and be put in a  prison camp?  T: Since I'm exiled, it's not to bo expected that I'll be let in to conduct activities.  I believe there will be changes. Soviet  feminists will develop and expand the movement and will have enough power to effect  a democratization of the system.  And the work goes on  Periodically, I make radio broadcasts into  the Soviet Union and get responses - it's  very heartening - from the working classes  and other classes.  I broadcast on the  Voice of America, BBC, Radio Free Europe,  and this is one way I hope to carry on  activities. Of course, I'll also continue  to work on the almanac - it's the main job.  Shortly before I arrived in Canada I began to work on the fifth issue of the  journal. I received the fourth issue after  I was exiled. It's possible I will devote  the fifth issue to women from other socialist countries.  H: What is your response to the. recently  passed Soviet law restricting women from  holding the 400 most difficult jobs?  T: It is the work of reactionaries who  are attempting to regress to the old ways  of forming society. After this law was  passed I was asked as a known feminist:  "Was this not what you were trying to  achieve?" Of course, we want rights,not  restrictions.  H: My question is about Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.    What is your reaction  to the rationale that it will be beneficial  to the women in Afghanistan to have the  regime supported by the Soviet Union.  The  rationale exists that the guerrilas are  reactionary and will keep women in feudal  and oppressed conditions.  T: A complex question. As a feminist, I  am against all types of war, not only the  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Even if  one were to assume that freedom could  come of this invasion I don't believe that  freedom should come on the heels of tanks.  Even before my exile to the west I heard  talk among the people that if it were  truly a just cause, they would send volunteers, but they send boys recently conscripted who know nothing about the issues.  As for Soviet middle asia where I've travelled many times, I must admit that the  condition of Soviet women in the republics  is somewhat better than the condition of  women in Afghanistan. Despite the reactionary nature of the present regime in  the Soviet Union one cannot say that there  is no element of socialism in the Soviet  state. A few benefits have come about.  In the early years of the revolution many  changes took place in Soviet middle asia.  I believe it was at this time that the  Soviet women stopped wearing the veil. I  have many friends in Soviet middle asia  who are progressive and freedom-loving and  who do not diffen from the average women  in the European USSR. They have no desire  to regress to the old patterns.  J: Do you have any advice to give us as  western feminists?   Should we change laws?  Change our lives?  T: I think Western feminists have already  done a lot. The way things are going they  will be successful in their victory.  I would suggest not despairing at some  small failures.  The patriarchy has existed for centuries, and it's not possible  to expect that change will come about in  a few years.  That doesn't mean that I  recommend that women wait a thousand  years\ ty  Mamonova gives short answers but inspires  By Jan De Grass  It was a great night for the non-aligned  feminists. Tatyana Mamonova, Soviet  feminists in exile, spoke before a full  house in the Ironworkers Hall in Vancouver.  She made statements like "Men have failed  at achieving socialism. Women must-show  them how." This warmed us to the depths  of our non-aligned hearts.  Instinctively we applauded when she said:  "Women will bring a new humanism to the  world." I swear I even heard someone say  "Right on, Tatyana.'"  But after the first heady flush wore off  we asked ourselves the same questions that  trouble those who struggle for the correct  line. How do we do this? How do women  do this?  Tatyana's responses were only short answers  to complex questions. Her answers scarcely  gave credibility to the depth that does  exist in Tatyana Mamonova - the side she  revealed at her press conference and in  more extensive conversations with Kinesis.  She is an articulate observer of the  Soviet system.  A member of the audience asked her to  consider the enormity of military power in  the Soviet Union and USA and to comment on  whether women can really contend with it  and how. Tatyana skirted the answer to  that question and other international  questions such as one concerning Afghanistan. It was good to hear her say: "I don't  think tanks bring freedom," and I can believe that.  But what does bring freedom?  And more importantly, how do you stop the  tanks?  Almanac hand-written, hand-produced  The first Soviet feminist journal was published in November, 1979 under her editorship. Tatyana told women at Women in  Focus that the feminist movement in the  Soviet Union was only one year old. It's  beginnings were tied to the publication of  this hand-written,hand-reproduced document.  Let's consider where the western feminist  movement was in 1968/69 after its first  year of contemporary struggle. Kate  Millet's Sexual Politics wasn't published  until 1969 and many Vancouver organizations  were just beginning. Had we time to  examine what it all meant? We tried. We  went to consciousness raising groups and  discussed things.  But we needed time to  develop a body of literature; we had to  study our own history; we had to make  personal and political changes.  Scarcely 12 years later we've gained some  idea of where we're going even if we don't  know how to get there. We have some  vision of the future. The Soviet womens'  movement appears to have no clear idea of  its own directions yet and that will take  time to develop. The lack of direction  would account for the vividly contrasting  politics of contributors to the almanac.  One of the contributors, Goricheva,  rejoices in the purity of the Virgin Mary,  while another contributor, Batalova,  agonizes over the suffering of giving  birth. Mamonova, the editor and a self-  described socialist, prints her symbolic  poetry.  "We broke the silence."  Mamonova summarizes the first edition of  the Almanac:  "We wrote of things that  are known to everyone in the Soviet Union.  In the very first issue we told of the  conspiracy of silence in the official  Soviet press about the situation of women.  We told of the exploitation of the Soviet  woman in the family and at work. We told  of the single mothers, who receive a state  allowance of five rubles a month and  this endure horrible degradation. We  wrote of the drunkeness of our husbands  and of the rape that to one degree or  another all women In the USSR experience."  After Mamonova's exile from the country,  another feminist Vera Golubeva took over  the editorship of the Almanac. She was  subsequently arrested for her work on the  journal, and was threatened with severe  punishment. On March 8th, she was released. Mamonova is adamant that the show of  international solidarity from western  feminists was significant in her release.  The first edition of the Almanac is more  cathartic than analytical and this is a  necessary step.  It is also courageous.  Self-revelation in the Soviet Union is  dangerous and has sent women to prison  camps and into exile. Try to develop a  strategy for the feminist movement when  your leaders are split up, sent away or  have had their typewriter or telephone  confiscated.  These women need our admiration and help. 14       Kinesis April'81  INTERNATIONAL  Everything from condoms to nukes  Tatyana Mamonova speaks out on health issues  Tatyana Mamonova visited the Womens Health  Collective and spoke with members on issues  of womens health care in the Soviet Union.  WOMENS HEALTH COLLECTIVE: A lot of us have  read about your tour through the States and  we were surprised to hear you say that  there is no birth control available in the  USSR,  except abortion.  TATYANA: I wouldn't say we have no birth  control. But methods are so primitive that  women don't resort to them. Naturally, we  don't have such modern methods as the pill  and the spiral (IUD) but the society is  not provided with the tools to produce  these. There are chemical forms of birth  control used, but they have dangerous  side effects. Chemical methods are inserted vaginally, and there is a primitive  form of condom for men and equally primitive forms of a condom for women.  WHC: Sounds like the diaphragm. And the  cervical cap.  TATYANA: The main reason that men and  women don't resort to birth control is  ignorance of their sexuality. Women don't  know much about these things. They are  afraid to ask because they are treated  coarsely.  WHC: Is that a means to discourage birth  control?  T: No, in general, this is the way of  Soviet life.  WHC: Lately women have taken the position  that the pill,  etc,  is too dangerous to  use and we support the use of the diaphragm  and the cervical cap.  T: Is that considered good here? Soviet  women don't like to use it because it is  painful.  WHC: Is part of the reason that more sophisticated forms of birth control have not  been developed because of the acceptance of  abortion since the 1920"s?  T: The only reason that I can think of is  the lack of sexual education. They just let  it ride. Birth control is a forbidden  topic, so nothing can circulate on a personal level. Mothers are embarrassed to discuss it with their daughters.  WHC: Am I to understand that abortion is  readily available?  T: There is no problem getting one. Some  women may have had up to 15 abortions in  her lifetime.  WHC: Can you tell us something of the procedure used for abortions?    Who does them?  It's illegal, but . . .  T: As a rule you can have an abortion up  to three months. You see a doctor and get  a pass to go to the hospital. Women do get  abortions past three months, though. It's  illegal, but if they have a friendly  doctor...It's not exactly illegal after  three months. It's legal if you can find  a friendly doctor to do it.  WHC: After three months it's a different  procedure in Canada. I'm wondering what  procedure would be used there?  T: I've only heard of one crude method used  in the Soviet Union - scraping without  anaesthetic. Nowhere do they economize  more than in women's health care. You are  supposed to go to special divisions of the  hospital for your abortions and women often  get sick from being there. It's not only  physical trauma, but emotional. You are  often in the same room with three other  women and can watch their treatment.  Doctors try to do the abortion quickly and  get it over with. So quickly that sometimes you can see the fetuses piling up as  you walk in. Women are sometimes tied  down.  There are anti-abortion groups. The group  "Maria" that split off from the Almanac is  anti-abortion. They are trying to maintain  the purity of women, therefore it's paradoxical that their type of feminism developed in to an anti-lesbian, anti abortion  movement which supports the patriarchal-1  society.  WHC: What is the average family size?  T: In large cities families are usually  limited to one kid. However, in republics  like Kazakhstan and Georgia there is a  cultural tradition toward larger families.  Women are given medals for having more  than 10 kids. The medals say Mother-Hero  on them but these women need more than a  steel medal.  WHC: Can you give an estimate of the number of single parents?  T: Such open statistics are not available  in the USSR. I fought with the KGB about  this.  WHC: Is sterilization available in the  Soviet Union?  T: For men I have never heard of such a  procedure. Please describe it.  For women - doctors won't even do a  Ceasarean Section when a woman wants it.  They say that there are so many sick people,  they cannot imagine doing a sterilization.  Maybe if someone were to pay a lot.  WHC:    If they're doing a D & C I can't understand the mentality that says doing a  vasectomy would be too much trouble.  T: The mentality is this. The scraping is  simple and not time-consuming. After all,  we are building socialism, we can't be  fooling around. We're dealing with centuries and centuries of the phallocracy in  the Soviet Union. It's manly to do certain  things - like sit around and drink vodka.  Men think that birth control is up to the  women and they don't have to do anything  about it.  WHC: Where do births take place? In home  or in the hospital?  T: To have a home birth is a dream. Women  birth in hospital, with no anaesthetic unless they are near death. The conditions  are deplorable. I asked for a home birth  and was stared at as if I were from another  world.  Women are allowed natural births but they  are done under terrible conditions, so  ruptures (tears) are common. Suturing is  done without anaesthetic.  WHC: Are there midwives? Are they legal?  T: There are professional midwives who  work with doctors. For every five or  six women birthing in a room there is one  doctor and one midwife. When the child is  about to be born, the woman must walk by  herself to another part of the hospital.  I saw a doctor laughing at one woman  whose baby was about to be born. After  seeing these experiences I decided to write  and publish the almanac.  WHC^re most doctors women?  T: Yes, women practically form the entire  medical profession and the responsibility  of the family also falls on the women. Male  doctors can pursue the profession as they  please. The government boasts that doctors  are women, but Soviet doctors are poorly-  paid compared to the USA. Doctors are  paid as poorly as teachers, both of which  are the lowest paid in the society.  WHC: But the doctors who are helping  women give birth are women?  T: Yes, to understand how these women treat  other women so horribly you must understand  that they are overworked, have their own  families and lack equipment. I don't pass  judgement on them.  Work day is never done  They are run down by their situation; they  have no morale or stamina left to be good  to the patients. There are line-ups outside the clinics. After work they have  their family responsibilities. On top of  everything they must drop their children  at the nursery in peak hours and get caught  in the crush. You should see the busses -  horrible, no mufflers! You take a woman who  is friendly the first day and by the fifth  day she has no strength for being nice.  Most people have no car. Most people live  communally - one house with five to seven  families. They share one toilet and usually  no bath.  In order to understand the lives  of these women you must understand all  these aspects of their lives.  WHC: Are these conditions the same for  everyone?  T: I have never been in a Kremlin hospital. ..perhaps.  WHC: One surgery that is often abused in  North America is hysterectomy, particularly  around menopause.    Is this the same here?  T: Hysterectomies are performed but not  as much as in the west. Mostly for cancer.  Again, it's difficult to get statistics.  Breasts are often removed. I had a friend  who at age 13 had part of her breast removed, although she did not have cancer.  Unnecessary surgery is common.  Surgery may also be done on the mentally-  ill, but its top secret. A doctor may  leak information but at great risk to herself. Our society is an extremely closed  one. We are not given information and are  forbidden from analyzing it.  WHC: I'd like to ask about occupational  health.    There are government standards  for dangerous substances that workers may  come into contact with.    Are Soviet workers  protected or paid more for handling these  substances?  T: It differs from job to job. I worked  in an antibiotics lab for five years and  that was hazardous. All workers were  promised benefits. I never saw any.  Contrary to the Soviet press around protection standards, everything is geared  towards militarization.  A village became an inferno after an explosion at a military plant. It was not  covered in the press. Nuclear plants are  built within city limits and certainly  there are bad effects on health, but  doctors keep their secret sources and patients don't know. There is a superior  feature of life in the west - the press.  Soviet press acts as a filter and blocks  information. Many factories.and plants  are known only by number. Many of the  workers don't even know what goes on there.  WHC: Is there an awareness amongst the  general population of the dangers of  nuclear power?  T: Occasionally lectures are given at  these plants on their effects but because  workers are so tired after their work they  don't go or go under.duress, and don't  assimilate anything. Kinesis April '81  INTERNATIONAL  Women and the draft  It may be equal, but is it free?  On March 24, the U.S. Supreme Court heard  arguments on the constitutionality of the  male-only draft.  Isabel Katz Pinzer of the American Civil  Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project  says four groups have filed "Friend of the  Court" briefs in the case, charging that  the male-only draft is discriminatory.  Pinzer says these groups include the National Organization for Women, a group of  Congressmembers, the National Organization  of Men, and a coalition of women's groups.  That coalition includes the Women's Equity  Action League, the League of Women Voters,  the Federation of Organizations for Professional Women, the American Association  of University Women, the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's  Clubs, the Women Lawyers Association of  Los Angeles, the National Women Students  Coalition, and others.  These briefs, Pinzer says, contend that  the male-only draft discriminates against  men by making them alone bear the burden  of the country's defense, and discriminates  against women by belittling and patronizing them.  Pinzer says a group backed by Phyllis  Schlafly, who opposes the Equal Rights  Amendment, has also filed a "Friend of  the Court" brief. That brief, Pinzer says  argues against the drafting of women on  behalf of 16 young women who, according  to Pinzer, contend the drafting of women  would be unladylike.  If the Supreme Court should rule that the  present draft law is discriminatory, congress would have to pass new legislation  that includes women - before the selective  service could call up young men or young  women for induction.  In a related story, two American anti-war  groups are charging that including women  in the draft would not lead to greater  equality for women.  According to Jim Bristol, of the American  Friend's Service Committee's Anti-Draft  Program, adding young women to the ranks  of potential draftees would increase the  burdens on women without necessarily en  hancing their rights. Bristol cites as  examples blacks and other minorities who,  he says, did combat service in disproportionate numbers during the Vietnam war but  did not achieve, in the years following,  full equality in civilian life.  Bristol says, in fact, "The draft has hurt  blacks and hispanics and poor whites. It  hasn't given them equal rights." Bristol  says the AFSC is all for the Equal Rights  Amendment, but including women in the  draft is "a perversion of what's involved  with the Equal Rights Amendment."  A spokesperson for the Feminism and Nonviolence Project of the War Resisters  League has also challenged the contention  that drafting women would increase their  likelihood of achieving equality.  Helen Michalowski says military life is  so oppressive that men should seek equality with women by not being drafted.  Michalowski says the nature of military  life involves the loss of individual  freedom. Soldiers, Michalowski says, have  no right to union representation, do not  get full freedom of speech and association,  have no right to petition, and have less  control over their living conditions,  working conditions and the use of their  own bodies than do civilians. Says Michalowski, "It's a contradiction to say  that in the interests of greater freedom  one would submit to greater oppression."  (Her Say)  Polish feminism is finally surfacing  Gdansk — Polish women, as well as more  publicized Polish men, have been organizing for changes in their society. It was  the firing of factory worker Anna Walen-  tynowicz for political activity that  caused the Polish strikes of 1970, and it  was she, together with Lech Walesa, who  organized the union movement. In 1976, when  women took to the streets to protest increased food prices, 17 people paid with  their lives.  In the summer of 1980, women textile workers in Lodz, Poland's second largest industrial town, went on strike to protest  the disappearance of meat a month before  the men's strikes in Gdansk. The slogan  they used was "From meat to liberty".  Later, women workers forced the Gdansk  strike committee to add five demands to  their original 16 point program. Point 17  asks for better child care facilities for  working mothers. Point 18 asks for paid  maternity leave of three years. (Currently, women are allowed a three years' unpaid leave.)  Women make up 42$ of the paid labor force.  After World War II, many new workers,  especially rural women, were recruited to  help the country industrialize. Men and  women have been equals under Polish law  since-1952. An emphasis on education for  women has eliminated illiteracy, but women  still work mostly in fields that have been  traditionally considered "female jobs."  If they find work in other fields, it is  usually in lower paying, lower prestige  jobs. Men and women with the same educational backgrounds will have different  careers: men as managers of the factories  and representatives of the government,  women as the workers. Women are supposed  to look for social gratification primarily  outside the workplace, and the family is  still seen as the ideal place for women's  self-realization.  The Polish state officially condemns the  patriarchal family, claiming to have established a new kind of family based on  a partnership in which men and women  share the same responsibilities.  A survey of young Poles made in 1977  showed that Polish youth does not envision a future without a family, and that  family is probably more the traditional  type of family based on a woman's double  work day. Wives spend an average of at  least four hours a day doing housework;  only 60/S of their husbands help even  occasionally. The demands of the Gdansk  workers reflect that there is not enough  childcare available, (in fact, in many  Eastern European countries, social scientists are suggesting that less day care  should be provided and that children are  better off in the home — as are mothers.)  The connections between the dissident  movement and the Catholic Church leave  room for speculation that women might not  fare so well with their demands.  But Polish women are moving and making  demands. This spring, a group of 100 Polish  women met in Warsaw to discuss feminism.  As in Russia in 1979, now in Poland, we  are seeing the beginnings of a feminist  movement! (Off Our Backs)  Utah steps up abortion  harassment  The Utah legislature has come up with some  new harassment techniques for women wanting abortions.  At least 24 hours before an abortion is  performed, every Utah doctor has to sign  a form saying that the woman who has chosen  abortion has been shown "descriptions of  the physical characteristics of a normal  unborn child described at two-week intervals, beginning with the fourth week and  ending with the 24th week.  "These descriptions shall include information about physiological and anatomical  characteristics, brain and heart function  and the presence of external members and  internal organs."  And pictures, too. To go along with these  descriptions, the doctor must also show  the woman "scientifically verified photographs of the unborn child" during various stages of its development.  The measure was sponsored by a Republican,  Robert Sykes. It passed the Utah Senate  21-4. The Senate rejected 7-11 an amendment which would have exempted women who  had become pregnant as a result of incest  or rape. Senator Verl Asay said that rape  and incest have been used as "a loophole  for abortions," adding that he considered  murder a more serious crime than rape or  incest.  Office workers call for  VDT moratorium  Cleveland, Ohio — The Working Women's  10,000 member National Association of  Office Workers wants to call a moratorium  on the introduction of video display terminals (VDTs: word processing typewriters  with video screens) into offices.  The group is concerned with technology's  potential for displacing jobs without  being able to provide adequate compensation. A study done by the Siemens Corp.  has shown that in less than 10 years,  A0%  of the work done in offices will be  automated.  The group's concern over the VDT's is also  linked with studies which have shown that  workers using VDTs experience eyestrain,  migraine headaches, and nausea (due to  poorly adjusted machines, and inadequate  lighting). The workers are also fearful  of the impact of their long-term low-level  exposure to radiation.

As  the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares to institute a code of conduct for  companies exporting baby formula to the  Third World, UNICEF Executive Director Jim  Grant estimates that a strict code could  save "a million lives a year," from needless death.  The formula manufacturers, led by the giant  Swiss-based multinational Nestle Corporation, calculate the cost of a stringent  code in diminished profits from their $1  billion a year sales to the Third World.  And they are "pulling out every gun they  can to shoot down the code," according to  Doug Johnson, national chairperson of the  Infant Formula Action Coalition (INFACT).  The coalition has coordinated a boycott of  Nestle's products to pressure the company  to stop pushing formula in countries where  unsanitary water makes formula an often  lethal substitute for breast-feeding.  The debate has raged ever since INFACT •  launched its boycott in 1977, charging  that promotion of formula in the Third  World as the "modern" way of feeding  babies was both unethical and deadly. But  with the WHO executive council meeting in  late January to draw up a code for approval by the World Health Assembly in May,  the controversy has intensified.  An internal memorandum leaked to INFACT  reveals a callous attitude towards the  suffering caused by misuse of its formula  in the Third World. Nowhere does the  report acknowledge the validity of concern  voiced by health and church activists over  the spread of formula into Third World  nations where it has now replaced mother's  milk for an estimated six million infants.  Instead, the memo gloats over the success  it has had in using an ostensibly neutral  think tank to brand church critics as  "Marxists marching under the banner of  Christ".  The memo, written by Nestle's vice-president Ernest Saunders, reveals both the  company's anxiety over the boycott cam- -  paign and the lengths it is prepared to go  to counteract it.  Although Saunders contends that "the basic  strategy for dealing with the boycott is  working," INFACT notes that the very existence of the memo shows that the company  is running scared. "The fact that a  senior Nestle vice president is required  to make extensive reports to the head of  the company (annual sales over $13 billion)  about efforts to contain the boycott, and  ask his approval to take new steps (including hiring new staff and spending more  money), shows how worried Nestle is about  the boycott," INFACT contends in its account of the "Nestlegate" memorandum.  "The basic strategy" referred to by Saunders appears to consist of buying favourable public opinion by placing articles in  major journals, hiring third-party spokespersons, and hiding behind organizations  like the Ethics and Public Policy Centre  (EPPC), a right-wing think tank which  funded Fortune  magazine's Washington editor Herman Nickel to conduct "a comprehensive study of the infant formula issue."  The main feather in the Nestle campaign's  cap to date was a Nickel article entitled  "The Corporation Haters", that appeared in  the June 18, 1980 issue of Fortune  and  was subsequently reprinted and distributed  by Nestle. The corporation showed its  appreciation by donating $25,000 to the  EPPC, whose president, Ernest W. Lefever  leveled another blast at the Nestle boycott in a Wall Street Journal  article on  January 14, 1981.  While Nestle official Saunders urged the  company to seek out other "third-party  rebuttals" and to "fully exploit" the Fortune  article, nutrition experts joined  ^Otj ^  Don't Buy These Products:  Taster's Choice  Nescafe  DeCaf  Sunrise Coffee  Pero  QUIK  Choco-Chill  Nestle Chocolate  CRUNCH  Souptime  Lancome cosmetics  L'oreal cosmetics  Maggi Products  Swiss Knight Cheese  Stouf fer products  Stouffer restaurants  & Hotels  Berringer Bros, wines  Los Hermanos wines  Libfcy, McNeill and  Libby products  Crosse & Balckwell  products  Deer Park Mountain  Spring Water  INFACT in deploring the corporate propaganda. In a letter to the Wall Street  Journal,  the chief of pediatrics at the  Kaiser Permanente Medical Centre in California condemned Lefever's piece for having  "glossed over the significant medical  issues."  In Third World nations, he argued, "poor,  often contaminated water, no adequate refrigeration and poor distribution ... result in a prepared formula which is frequently contaminated and which is unable  to be stored properly." The end result is  "dehydration (sometimes fatal) and malnutrition."  Leah Marguiles, director of the Infant  Formula Program of the Interfaith Center  on Corporate Responsibility challenged  readers of Nickel's "grossly irresponsible"  Fortune  article "to visit an emergency  rehydration ward in any Third World country. I do not think they will come home  and tell the churches to stop challenging  corporations toward greater social responsibility in their business practices."  INFACT and church groups active in the  boycott plan to be "very interested and  involved" in the effort to see a strict  code endorsed by the World Health Assembly  in May. Its memo indicates that Nestle  will be equally active in lobbying for a  weak, industry-approved code.  Former WHO assistant director Dr. Stanislaus Flache was hired last August by the  International Council of the Infant Food  Industry and has been "out lobbying for  the industry position, using his contacts,"  INFACT's Johnson reported. And Senator  Strom Thurmond reportedly wrote to the  Reagan administration's U.N. ambassador,  Jeanne Kirkpatrick, on the basis of  Lefever's Wall Street Journal  article,  urging her to place the U.S. government  firmly against a strict code.  Meanwhile, Johnson says, INFACT "will continue monitoring industry violations" of  a code the manufacturers had accepted in  October 1979 as a "constructive and important landmark in the battle against malnutrition." To date, Johnson told LNS,  "we've documented over 600 violations."  All of which proves/ in Johnson's view,  that "it will be an important moral victory if a code passes in May. But it will  not be enforceable and there is no guarantee the industry will abide by it. So  we're going to keep stepping up direct  action, stepping up the boycott. Because  that's clearly the only thing Nestle will  pay any attention to."  Q  ' 'Silicon Valley"  workers suffer  reproductive problems  Women working in and around the electronics industry - supposedly one of America's  "cleanest" industries - are experiencing  serious reproductive problems.  That's according to Michael Eisenscher,  an organizer with the United Electrical  Workers Union in San Jose, California.  Eisenscher says he is receiving reports  from California's so-called "Silicon  Valley" of "extraordinary" numbers of  women who are having trouble carrying  babies to term, or are experiencing  reproductive problems ranging from unusual  hemorrhaging and premature hysterectomies,  to giving birth to malformed children.  Eisenscher says at one company, a woman  clerical worker in a building formerly  used for production of semiconductors  polled her 400 fellow workers, and found  that of 13 pregnancies over the past two  years, only five of the women had succeeded in bringing their babies to full term.  Eisenscher says little is known about  what is causing the health problems, but  he believes the chemicals used in electronics production may be affecting  women's abilities to reproduce. He says  a women's group being set up to assess  the problem will hold a press conference  sometime in the next few weeks.  Why aren't we getting  paid for our labour?  Canada is far behind other countries in  providing paid maternity leave. A 1978  study summarized the following facts:  Sweden has nine months parental leave at  90$ salary; the father and mother can  share this;  Denmark has 14 weeks at 90$ salary;  Great Britain has six weeks maternity  leave at 9052 salary and 29 weeks without  pay;  Italy has 20 weeks maternity leave at  100$ salary in the public sector (otherwise 80%);  France has 14 weeks at 90$ and parental  leave of two years without pay;  Germany provides 14 weeks at 100/? in the  public service; leave without pay is one  to three years;  The Netherlands has 12 weeks at 1005?;  Spain has 14 weeks at 90$;  The Polish strikers recently obtained one  year at 1005?, the second year at 50$ and  the third year at 505?;  In Quebec, 200,000 public service workers  are covered by an agreement which provides  20 weeks paid maternity leave at 935? plus  a 7%  pension supplement (which is the  equivalent of 1005?).  (Status of Women, BCTF - Oct/Nov 1980) Kinesis April'81        17  ACROSS CANADA  ACSW member tells the other side of the Doris Anderson story  By Joanne Limey  From Yukon, Joanne Linzey is a member of  the Advisory Council on the Status of Women.  This article is from The Optimist.  As I start to write about the terrible  controversy raging around the Canadian  Advisory Council on the Status of Women I  am filled with sadness, frustration and a  deep burning rage.  Doris Anderson has slandered the executive,  she has publicly accused the members  of being "patsies, knee jerk liberals,  ignorant and lazy." She has been patronizing, belittling and has created a  distorted impression of events leading up  to her resignation as the Council president .  Doris Anderson resigned because she had  lost the confidence of her executive and  the majority of her Council. She lost our  confidence not over any supposed ministerial interference but because she repeatedly failed to consult with the council  and be responsive to its consensus. Doris  I  told us she had failed to "control her  executive". She had, I suspect never  worked with women's groups and really  didn't understand how the group approach  works. She didn't like to be.bothered by  the concerns of the members and when members expressed their feelings she called  us "bitchy".  It's perhaps important here to outline the  structure of the Council. It consists of  thirty appointed members from across  Canada and its function is: to bring to  the government and to the public matters  of concern to women; and to advise the  Minister on matters the Minister or the  Council deem appropriate. The Council  over the years has played a major role in  forcing governments to respond to women's  concerns and has built up an excellent  research reputation. The executive of  the Council consists of an appointed full  time President, three full time appointed  vice-presidents and two volunteer members•  representatives who are elected annually  by the membership. I felt honoured to  be elected in June 1980 as their anglophone representative on the executive.  It was not a council of equals  It became readily apparent to me that Doris  was not concerned with creating a Council  of equals. She felt her views were the  right ones and did not easily tolerate  any opposition. I remember being stunned  by the overriding will of this person.  For instance, in June 1980 the full membership had to force her to present the  employment committee's recommendations  to the minister. She thought they might  annoy him for they were very critical of  the federal government's strategies. We  had to fight to remind her that she was  obligated to us to present our statements.  The conflict over the timing of the Constitutional Conference brought the simmering discontent to a boil. Doris Anderson,  alone, had set the February conference  date despite the fact that the two francophones on the executive had been expressing  dissatisfaction with a February date as  the Quebec women wanted more preparation  time.  The Charter of Rights is only one item  The Council presented a strong position on  the matter of entrenchment of a Charter of  Rights in a constitution to the Joint  House Senate Committee in November of 1980.  The position is firmly formulated and  many of our concerns have since been acted  on.  It is important to remember that the  issue of the Charter of Rights is only  one item in the total picture of Constitutional reform. It was the most pressing  as it would be under Trudeau's proposal  amended in the constitution before it is  returned to Canada. The National Action  Committee has a list of fifteen items of  concern for women, included in the list  are the entrenchment of human rights,  Indian rights, family law, economics, and  education. The Federal Government's 1980  priority list of thirteen includes the  charter, family law,supreme court, and  communications.  At the January 9th executive meeting the  decision was made to postpone the conference. It was made for several reasons,  one of the primary ones was that the  urgency on developing a Charter position  had been dealt with. We felt it was time  to move on to the other issues. Family  law and overlapping jurisdictions are  now are priority issues and by delaying  the conference to May we have obtained  more time for proper preparation. I  personally was very concerned that our  book of publication on the constitutional .  issues be available and mailed to women  for study before any conference. This  would not happen at a February conference.  The accusations made by Doris Anderson  that we buckled to ministerial pressure  are absurd. The executive requested that  the minister meet with the full executive  as we were no longer confident that Anderson would accurately represent the minister  to us or us to the minister. The minister's  parting sentence was "that it is your decision, it is your conference. I can live  with it either way.  We returned to our office to take the 5-1  vote. Doris Anderson had several options.  She could have refused to accept it; she  could have insisted on polling the membership; she could have issued her ultimatum.  She did note of these things. She instead  asked what we should do about a press  release. It should be noted that at this  time only the members and between 12 to 20  speakers had been notified of the February  date. Therefore, there was no need to  issue a press release and Doris insisted  on passing such a motion. She then wanted  a new date set, we defeated a motion to  that effect stating that the question must  be.taken to the full membership.  What about that 'unedited transcript'?  A word about the so-called "unedited  transcript" of the executive meeting. The  secretary was not at the Axworth meeting,  at our executive meeting and her  She '  minutes do not portray the business of  the meeting. There is no recording of  why I voted for the conference to be postponed or insistence that the issue go to  the general membership even though I asked  for that to be recorded.  The meeting adjourned after items were  discussed. I returned home.  The next working day Doris Anderson walked  into the Ottawa office, mailed out all the  invitations and called in the press.  ■The smear campaign began.  My sense of frustration and hence this  article stems from an inability to present  our "side" through the national press.  The national media almost unanimously  have presented biased one-dimensional  reporting.  My sense of sadness comes from the harm  that has been done to the women's movement.  Women against women. Women judging and  condemning us without even asking us what  happened. Women assuming we are guilty.  My sense of anger directed at many things  but a large part of it goes to Doris '  Anderson, and to the politicians who  raised the issue in the House of Commons  for a week. Where are they when women  need funding for transition homes or daycare, or when discriminating legislation  needs to be amended?  What next?  I think the Council's reputation for first  rate research will not be destroyed by  the actions of one individual. The relationship with some of the women of the  country will have to be healed. I'm  impressed by the strengths and dedication  of the Council ls feminist and they have  made the commitment to go on working in  their regions to start that healing  process.  • 18       Kinesis April '81  Welcome to Womansize at new Women In Focus gallery  By Jill Pollack/Women In Focus  WOMANSIZE: Large Renderings of Women's Imagery is a three-part exhibition held at  the Women In Focus Gallery's new location  — on the second floor, 456 West Broadway.  The first exhibition, Fibre/Fabric Arts,  runs from March 17 to April 4,  1981.  Comprised of 14 women artists and consisting of 19 works, Fibre/Fabric Arts contains  examples of batik, embroidery, fabric applique, quilting, salish weaving, tapestry  weaving and sisal weaving. The artists  are: Jean Affleck, Trudy Braidwood, Karen  Chapnick, Cristina Estable, Marilyn Fou-  bert, Barbara Heller, Jean Kamins, Julie  Kemble, Eva Kupczynski, Pinky Lowe, Sys  Richards, Truus Scott, Catherine Shapiro  and Anabel Stewart.  Fibre, fabric artists ignored  Fibre and fabric artists have been given  little credibility by the male-dominated  art world, and this has been reflected in  society as a whole. They are classified as  "craftspeople", a term which is not in itself denigrating, but which has been given  a negative connotation by galleries which,  on the whole, have refused to exhibit their  work.  Because the majority of artists in these  media are women (and therefore, threatening), the strategy for the male-controlled  structure within the arts has been to deny  women the power inherent in self-expression.  These women's works have been suppressed  and refused recognition.  An excellent example of this is found in  the film, Granny's Quilts, presented in  conjunction with the exhibit on March 25  at the Women in Focus Gallery.  Mrs. Catherine Scott was 87 years old at  the time of film-making. She has been  quilting since 1903, and lately has produced a quilt a month, all hand-sewn. She  does meticulous work — chosing the materials, colours and patterns, and executing  them with near-failing eyesight.  Numerous examples of her work are shown in  the film, and the audience response was  overwhelming, especially when, in the final frame of the film, an exquisite 'Star  of Bethlehem' quilt was shown, with Catherine Scott's voice saying, "But of course  I'm not an artist!"  Second exhibit runs through mid-April  The second exhibit in WOMANSIZE, Paper/Can-  vas/Multi Media, runs from April 10 to  25. It is comprised of 11 B.C. artists and  consists of 14 works. The exhibiting artists are: Judith Atkinson, Audrey Capel  Doray, Josie Cook, Susan H. Eredies, Meredith Feldmar, Diana Kemble, Barbara Seamon,  Phyllis Serota, Sandra Jane Shaw, Roberta  Sutherland and Ingrid Yuille.  Apparent in most of the pieces is a shift  away from a largely male-defined style to  the creation of works more deeply rooted  in the lives and experiences of women.  For a very long time, by virtue of daring  to express themselves through painting, women were chastised, outcast, ridiculed and  belittled.  And although the most 'credible' and * acceptable' as artforms, the fields of painting and photography have encompassed many  different styles and standards. Yet none  of these have presented specific female  imagery as one of the qualifications of  excellence or validation as an artform.'  Thus even women working in the most widely  exhibited of genres face enormous barriers  in gaining the recognition they deserve.  An interesting common thread in this exhibit is that of re-gaining the past. Three  of the works, Mother and Daughter,  1923  by Sandra Jane Shaw, Eulogy to Mother —  Grace Marion McGraw by Judith Atkinson,  SUSAN H. EREDICS, Magyar Szonata -3, acrylic on canvas, 4" by 4"  On display at Womansize, April 10 to April 25  and Fish, baby by Josie Cook deal specifically with the relationship between mother and child.  The artists' approaches and imagery vary,  but the connection that we, as women, have,  whether to our children or to our mothers,  is one which has rarely been explored in  mainstream art from a female perspective.  Yet we have been inundated with the patterns of behaviour, the sexualities, the  lifestyles and the personal experiences of  men throughout his story and this has, of  course, pervaded the art that has been presented to us.  The impact of the visual image as a powerful statement of one woman's life and  struggles is depicted in the film, The Life  and Death of Frida Kahlo, which is being  shown, along with a documentary on Imogen  Cunningham, on Wednesday, April 5 at 8:30  p.m. at Women In Focus.  Frida Kahlo portrayed her innermost views  of herself as a woman at a time which puo-  lic disclosures of 'taboo' subjects by a  woman were startling — she depicted her  miscarriages, and herself wearing men's  clothing. She painted for years before  she gained recognition. Even then her fame  was mainly as the wife of Diego Rivera.  Also during Paper/Canvas/Multi Media, we  are presenting two videos, Judith Lodge  and Susan Beniston/Rosaline Swartzman.  Focusing on their technical expertise and  imagery sources, these two videos offer  a comprehensive overview of strong women  artists who have some sense that they are  women  artists.  Three-dimensional artists coming in May  The third exhibit in WOMANSIZE, Three  Dimensional, is comprised of eight B.C.  women artists and runs from May 2 to May  16, 1981. Consisting of 13 works, including an installation piece, this exhibit  presents examples of work by: Hinda Avery,  Nora Blanck, Georgiana Chappell, Jean T.  Higinbotham, Doreen Jensen, Sally Michen-  er, Isao Sanami/Morrill and Marcia Pitch.  As with fibre and fabric artists, three-  dimensional artists are faced with absurd  male-defined biases and discriminations.  Welded sculpture, wood sculpture, large  ceramic sculpture has been a male domain.  How dare women try to enter these fields!  There's technology involved!  Dinner Party film on May 6  Illustrating these points are two films,  Right Out of History: The Making of Judy  Chicago's Dinner Party (Wednesday, May 6  at 8:30 p.m.) and Louise Nevelson (Thursday, May 14 at 8:30 p.m.).  It's well known that Judy Chicago has h&d.  a struggle to find galleries willing to  exhibit the Dinner Party. Louise Nevelson,  who is flamboyant, avant-garde, intelligent and articulate — and who has never  experienced a lot of problems obtaining  exhibitions — has nevertheless had to  cope with the demands and pressures of  motherhood while trying to find time for  her art.  Avis Rosenberg on women sculptors  On Tuesday, May 12, at 8:30 p.m., Avis  Lang Rosenberg will be giving a slide/  lecture "Canadian Women Sculptors Before  Now" in the gallery space, featuring both  the known and lesser-known artists that  our country has largely chosen to ignore.  WOMANSIZE encompasses a multi-sensory approach to exhibiting artwork in an attempt  to provide women with both a forum to  express themselves visually and a meeting  place for women to view and experience  the ideas and imagery of other women.  Now take a look at the program highlights  on the opposite page, and mark them down  in your calendar. Kinesis April'81        19  CULTURAL WORK  Loved, Honoured and Bruised: it's a common story  It starts when the first baby is just six  months old: Jeannie's husband throws a pot  of boiling tea at them. It goes on and on  for the next 13 years. Finally, fearing  for her life, Jeannie flees from the family farm with her four children.  Loved, Honoured and Bruised. Not an uncommon story. And for that reason, a very important one. It's a half-hour film just released by the National Film Board of Canada. The people in the film are real.  Jeannie tells her story to the camera, to  us. And she examines the pain of the prolonged physical and mental abuse with her  social worker.  "I'm a timid sort," says her husband, who  agreed to be interviewed for the film.  Sometimes, he explains, the beatings were  a matter of discipline, like punishing a  child.  "You didn't want to do it but you  have to do something."  The dimensions of his terrible violence  are not in the least clear to him, not  even now that his family has had to leave  and here he is being filmed by the NFB as *  a wife batterer. He's even pleased that  he can get his anger out and over with.  "Half an hour later it's all gone."  "He almost seemed proud when I had a  shiner," Jeannie tells us.  The film was made with the assistance of  Osborne House, the YWCA's Winnipeg Transition House. At the recent screening in Vancouver, the local YWCA sponsored a panel  discussion with women involved in the work  against battering.  There was criticism of the film's version  of how Jeannie made the break with her 16-  year marriage.  A neighbour, who has know about the battering for some time, gives Jeannie a ride  into town, where the RCMP takes her to a  transition house. Only a matter of weeks  later, the court approves her application  for a separation. And hey presto  she is  ready to structure a new life.  As Jan Barnsley of the Women's Research  Centre pointed out, "leaving is just not  that easy."

Although not presented  in any strictly feminist context, they  may well be of interest to Kinesis readers.  Ingemo Engstrom's Letzte Liebe (Beyond  Love, 1979) is an examination of romantic  love in the light of the psychiatric concept of 'folie-a-deux' with commentary derived from Kafka. Jutter Bruckner's Hunger jahre (Hunger Years, 1980) deals with  an adolescent whose conflict with her mother  produces a sort of anti-anorexia: she cannot stop eating.  Helga Reidmeister's Von Wegen 'Schicksal'  (A Propos of Fate, 1979) is a documentary  look at the life of a recently divorced  and partially disabled housewife who finds  new satisfaction in working with tenants'  action groups.  Another documentary, Elfi Mikesch's Was  Soil»n Wir Denn Machen Ohhe Den Todd?  (What Would We Do Without Death?, 1980) is  a rebuke to popular misconceptions about  the loneliness of old age, focusing on  the wondefully supportive and affectionate  relationship among five old women in a  Hamburg retirement home.

CULTURAL WORK  Willmar 8 is a poignant movie of women's determination  By Lorraine Sorrell/OOB  In Willmar, Minnesota 8 women challenged  the sexist practices of the bank where  they worked. For 18 months, while the US  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  and National Labour Relations Board there  processed and weighed the charges, the  women formed a picket line and tried to  gain union recognition.  Through two Minnesota winters where the  wind chill registers minus 70 degrees,  the women exposed themselves to the colder  silence of their town. Willmar has 3  banks and 1 savings and loans association  to serve a population of 18,438. It was  such an unlikely site for a labour dispute  that US national media carried the story,  and Mary Beth Yarrow brought producer  Julie Thompson and actress Lee Grant to  her home town to film the strike.  Willmar 8  is an excellent documentary of  the strengths.and support women can and  must find within themselves when they  refuse socially expected roles.  Employed as tellers and bookkeepers, the  women had earned between $425 and $700 a  month. A young male trainee was hired at  nearly twice their starting salary, and  the women were told to train him. They  complained to the bank manager and asked  why they were qualified to train but did  not have a chance to qualify for the. job.  "We're not all equal, you know," he  replied.  Willmar is aptly described as a Christian  town where the social order is established  and described by its 29 churches. When  asked whether there were any Jews or Blacks  in the town, one resident replied, "Not  that I've been able to find."  Each of the strikers belongs to a different  church and takes her religion seriously,  but only the Unitarian church will tolerate  a discussion of strike issues with its  congregation. The chairman of the bank  slurs the women with just about the worst  label imaginable in Willmar calling them  "a bunch of Christian lesbians."  None of the women considers herself a  feminist. To Willmar women NOW was a  "coven of ultra radicals". What the 8  women realized was that their jobs were  stagnant, and if they didn't protest the  sexual discrimination they were accepting  the status of second-class citizen.  The issues their strike raises are too  deep and divisive to the web of community  relationships. Willmar's newspaper ignores  the story of Willmar's first strike in 40  years. Most of the town's population is  related to, friends of or dependent on the  bank management. Again and again the  residents reply "No comment" to the film  cameras.  The courage of the striking women and the  support they share is that much more  apparent in the contrasting vacuum around  them. Only two old ladies who belonged to  the railroad union talk to the film makers  recalling their strike.  As their meager funds dwindle, the women  try to find part-time jobs and realize  they're blacklisted. One woman tries to  sell her house and finds she cannot.  Before they distribute the strike funds  they've stretched out to last as long as  possible, they ask themselves who's in  the most need. In the next scene bills  fall casually into piles at a party of  women poker players who have regularly  met over 18 years. These women also know  everything about each other and tolerate  some discussion of the rights and responsibilities of women between poker hands,  but not on the strike directly.  Despite the town's unresponsiveness to  the strike, the bank's growth rate falls  from a 12$ profit to a 6%  loss. The  bank president is forced to retire early,  and the bank is sold. But the women  realize that there's little likelihood  they will be rehired unless the NLRB  rules in their favour.  "At first the strike was for ourselves,"  said one striker, "but then we realized  it's for others." At another bank a  teller asks one of them whether they think  they'll win. The woman on strike asks  whether conditions are any better at this  bank. The teller replies "yes", and the  striker says, "We've already won."  Help does come from outside Willmar. Some  feminists and union workers realize that  the 8 wome n are making the lowly women' s  work of the banking industry visible.  Their letters of encouragement mean a great  deal to the strikers; so does a parade of  United Auto Workers and other labour  supporters even though Willmar's streets  are deserted.  Willmar 8  is a poignant movie filmed in  10 days shortly before the women heard  from the US National Labour Relations  Board. They were too few to affiliate as  a local of existing unions, and they were  isolated from the networks and experience  of labour and women's organizations located in urban areas. The women learned  how to organize pickets, write leaflets  and speak to news media as they did it.  This film does not present specific skills  and tactics of organizing any more than  Norma Rae  did. But it can be used as an  organizing tool to help working women  discuss their experiences of discrimination  and to understand obstacles to collective  actions. The film makers are preparing  a handbook to use with the film that  suggests resources for working women.  The Willmar 8  can be rented locally from  IDERA, the International Development Educational Resource centre at 2524 Cypress.  Rental is $35 for a community group, $70  institutional. Contact them at 738-8815.  Don't wait for any feminist insights in Waiting for the Parade  By Joan Woodward  On September 10, 1939, Canada went to  war. Much has been written about the  hundreds of thousands of men who went  overseas to serve King and Country, but  little has been written about the women  they left behind.  "Waiting for the  Parade" attempts to tell that story.  Written by Canadian author John Murrell,  "Waiting for the Parade" is the story of  five women in Calgary, working together  to support the war effort while at the  same time, doing their best to survive  the uncertainty of those trying days.  For those of us who don't remember World  War II, the play is a slice of life from  the past. For those of us who do, it  will no doubt bring back memories.  Rationing, leg make-up in place of  stockings, Red Cross work, air raid drills,  letters from afar, sexual abstinence,  death notices and most of all, life  without men.  Unfortunately, the latter does not seem tc  be a major theme in the play, as I, at  least, was certainly expecting it to be.  There is no mention of women's newly-  found abilities and self-confidence as in  legion numbers they took the places of  their absent men in the workforce. Neither  is there any great show of mutual suppor-  tiveness as these particular five women  try to come to terms with a war-dazed  and war-crazed world.  Deborah Tennant and Patricia Wawick in Westcoast's  production of Waiting for the Parade. They're putting  makeup on their legs in lieu of stockings.  One is left to ask, why did the author, a  man, born in 1945, choose to write such a  play? The most likely answer for me is  in the role of "Marta", portrayed by  Sheelah Megill. Marta is a young German  woman who has immigrated to Canada with  her parents a number of years before the  war began.  At the beginning of the war, her father  is seized and taken to a Canadian prisoner  of war camp. Marta is left alone to keep  up his little tailoring shop in Calgary.  Throughout the war, Marta is plagued by  various kinds of unpleasantness and outright hostility from the community around  her because she is German.  Marta's character is the best developed  . in the play. The other four are one-  dimensional stereotypes. Unfortunately,  Marta's portrait does not carry much  punch. It has little relevance to the  racism we see unfolding in the Canada of  1981.  The saddest thing of all is that this play,  which purports to be about women, is  completely lacking in feminist consciousness. There's not so much as a glimmer.  In spite of its local colour, "Waiting for  the Parade" was hardly worth the effort  and skill the Westcoast company obviously  put into it. Kinesis April '81  CULTURAL WORK  Pork Roasts is coming. Don't miss this feminist barbecue  An international exhibition of recent  feminist cartoons, guest-curated by freelance art critic and art historian Avis  Lang Rosenberg, opens at the UBC Fine Arts  Gallery on April 1 and continues until  May 2. The exhibition brings together the  work of more than 100 cartoonists, over  three-quarters of whom are women. A fifth  of the work comes from Canada, a fifth  from England, two-fifths from the U.S.,  and the remainder from Germany, France,  Italy, New Zealand, India and elsewhere.  About one-eighth of the work is by men.  Great variety of drawing styles  The exhibition consists of photographic  reproductions and blowups of the cartoons,  which range from single frame images to  very long strips. Nearly all of them  have been published, primarily outside the  mainstream press. There is great variety  in the drawing styles, and a number of  the works have no accompanying words.  The exhibition has been funded by the Canada Council.  The cartoons have been arranged into eight  categories: "Life in the Phallocracy",  "Motherhood and HomeWork", "Workout in the  Work World", "Picturing the Situation",  "Body/Beauty/Womanhood", "Coupling (in Bed  or Thereabouts)", "Changing the Script",  and "We're Not Perfect Yet".  The catalogue is a large comic book priced  at $2.50 (plus 75fZ? postage and handling if  mailed). It has an intr6duction in English  by the guest curator, a comic-strip introduction in French by the Quehecoise cartoonist Mira Falardeau, and 62 pages of  cartoons.  Two special events accompany the Vancouver  showing of Pork Roasts:  250 Feminist Cartoons.    There will be a free slide lecture  front of her TV. Deadline for submissions  is April 24, and prizes will be the stamp  itself.  The exhibition is lightweight and available  to travel. Two bookings are confirmed so  far — Dec. 1-19 at Powerhouse in Montreal  and early 1982 at the Mount Saint Vincent  University Art Gallery in Halifax.  This is Nicole Hollander's Sylvia. Have her say something smart and she's all yours  of the image of women in cartoons, given  by Chicago cartoonist Nicole Hollander,  author of 3 books including, Ma,  can I be  a feminist and still like men?

Phone 228-2759 $  Heather brings us everything feminist lyrics to sultry songs  By Janet Berry  Heather Bishop and Laurie Conger delighted  the crowd at the Soft Rock when they came  to town last month. They were sponsored by  the Vancouver Folk Festival Society and  part of the proceeds went to the International Women's Day Committee.  From Toronto, Laurie Conger plays in the  all-woman band, Mama Quilla II, which is  coming to town this May. Laurie's electric  piano was a superb additon to Heather Bishop's guitar and piano.  The two women met at folk festivals, liked  each other's music and decided to tour  together. Vancouver was the stop on a  journey that will take them through 18 concerts from B.C. to Ontario.  Heather was born in Regina and lives in  Woodmore, Manitoba. She's a member of a  collective of seven women who live on a  quarter section of land. Heather and her  lover have just built a solar-heated house  there.  At one time, Heather was part of a five-  women prairie band, which played just about  everything but mostly country blues. A  few years ago, she decided she wanted to  develop herself as a solo performer. So  she set out on the coffeehouse-folk festival circuit.  Heather has had training as an electrician  and an auto-mechanic. With pride, she calls  herself a tradeswoman. A woman friend in  the trades who was having hassles from the  men inspired Heather's song, A Woman's Anger. At the Vancouver performance we were  treated to a prideful, powerful rendering  of this song:  Working everyday on a metal lathe  I'm a damn good machinist  I love my trade but there 's only one thing  that makes it hard to take  The guy next to me  who 's feelin kinda mean  and he's wishing I weren't here....  Hey buddy, what you're looking at  Now is a woman's anger  Boys, what you're seeing  right here is a woman's pride.  Heather is upfront about her feminism and  her life. She considers her feminism on  the stage as a way of bringing out the women's energy in the audience. "I like a  concert atmosphere where the women's energy is primary."  The Vancouver performance ranged from the  torch song, Am I Blue, to Dory Previn's  brilliant satire, Did Jesus Have a Baby  Sister? There was a comfortable balance  to the evening, with Heather and Laurie  each having some solo time.-And their combined efforts, with Laurie's electic Yamaha piano playing, were foot-tapping, infectious.  Heather and Laurie also treated us to a  reggae-inspired rendition of Please, Don't  Let Me Be Misunderstood. I've never been  her concerts. No hundred and one strings  here. Her love for the music she sings  come through all the numbers, whether they  are the ones with feminist lyrics or  the sultry blues numbers, the emotive  torch songs.  The title song, Celebration, written by  Karen Howe, is a beautiful composition  describing both the sufferings endured by  women and the spirit of escape and renewal.  You know it wasn't long ago  those dancing feet were bound and sewn....  So kick your heels up fine lady  Let me see your fancy footprints  In the valley let your melody  echo unrestrained  too fond of this song. It seemed insincere.  Heather changed my feelings. I got to  thinking of how, at various times in my  life, these words could have been coming  from my mouth.  Heather's latest album, Celebration, contains may of the pieces she.did at the  Soft Rock. What is nice about Heather^s  albums is that they are direct and honest.  The arrangements are true to her.style,  to the rich bluesy alto voice you hear in  Like Heather Bishop's earlier album,  Grandmother, this new one offers diversity. It ranges from A Woman's Anger, with  its fiesty lyrics, through to Cry Me A  River, a good heart-tugger of a song.  "I'm not in it to be a star," Heather  says. Early on, she decided to be upfront  in her music about her feminism and her  lesbianism. Her politics were too important to her for any other choice.  Both of her albums are available at Ariel  Books and the Women's Bookstore. MOVEMENT REPORTS  Feminist Counselling Association  holds first conference, March 5  Last year I heard through our dependable  grapevine that a collection of feminist  counsellors were meeting. I joined them  gladly. I went looking for discussion on  how to apply feminist counselling principles to the situations and institutions  that we- find ourselves in, and I went  looking for other women who work as  feminist counsellors. I need to know  where they are.  The meetings made possible discussions  and connections. The Feminist Counselling  Association grew so quickly in size that  we felt it time for a day-long conference,  a chance to meet for longer than an hour.  The Conference took place on March 5.  Brown lauds feminist therapy  Rosemary Brown opened with accounts of  feminist battles waged in parliament,  battles won that we largely have Rosemary  to thank for. She made a plea for help  in changing the social machinery, and  emphasized the need for us to education  ourselves about the system in order to  change it. She applauded the difference  between feminist therapy and traditional  therapy as an attempt to equalize power,  to insist on the values of non-aggression  and cooperation, and to put women's anger  and depression into proper social context.  Helen Levine was a joy to listen to.  Lavine, from Carleton University, Ottawa,  gave credit to the women's movement for  making feminist counselling visible. She  insisted that if we didn't feel that our  approach was radical, it probably wasn't  good enough. Helen would have all  feminist counsellors call themselves such  openly, and most of us could relate to  the strength of movement that such a stand  would bring.  In the small groups, reality surfaced  But reality surfaced when we moved into  small groups. For most of us, even the  word "feminist" is considered threatening  to the institutions we work for, and in  speaking with each other we began to  feel very much part of an underground  movement.  We divided into five workshops: Women  Re-entering the Workforce, Low Income  Women, Battered Women, Issues with Lesbian  Clients, and Sexual Abuse of Clients.  Each workshop was attended by over thirty  women, and out of these workshops have  come recommendations for further action,  a greater knowledge of where each other  is, and a clear picture of how much change  is needed.  At our next meeting we will be setting up  a coordinating body and focusing on particular tasks for this year: speakers on  the financial state of shelters for women,  the lack of proper career counselling,  the education of counsellors in the proper  approach to gay counselling, legal aid  series on sexual abuse of clients and a  telephone line for clients who have been  mistreated, publication of clients' rights  in all these areas.  It's just the beginning of what we'd like  to see. As usual, the speed of movement  depends on our numbers.

You're learning how to "maximize  profit" but are wondering uneasily how  this fits in with the goals of your own  organization. There is a program designed  for you.  Community Business Training provides unique  training in business skills that reflects  co-operative and community values. The  courses are designed to provide managerial  and organizational expertise to members of  community groups, co-ops (food, housing,  and producer), worker-owned businesses,  and non-profit service organizations.  This year Capilano College and CCEC Credit  Union are co-sponsoring another session  of Community Business Training to be held  in Vancouver from May 2-7, 1981. You  could attend for only three days and not  miss any of the key courses.  May 2 through 4  (Sat to Mon) will cover  basic "core" courses such as Democratic  Management, Financial Development, Management of Co-ops, Co-op History and Principles and Learning about Collective Process.  May 5 through 7 (Tues to Thurs) will cover  the more advanced versions of these  courses (Democratic Management, Financial  Management and Planning) and will also  include some specialized courses such as:  Food Business: Operations and Marketing,  Fund-Raising for Non-profit Groups and  Leadership in Housing Co-ops.  Last year*s participants gave an extremely  high rating to the Fundraising instructor  Joy Leach. She is back again this year  and brings with her an extensive knowledge  of funding sources in B.C. and across  Canada. She has helped raise funds for  social service organizations, women's  groups, arts organizations and co-op  projects.  Each class runs three hours a day for  three days. Tuition fees vary between  $85  a course for the "core" courses aid  $70 or $90 for specialized courses and  $10C for advanced courses. "Core" courses  could be useful to organizations of all  types, while specialized courses will  focus on the needs of three groups: food,  housing and non-profit. Lunchtime work-^  shops on various topics will also be included as part of the fee. Contact:  Community Business Training,  c/o CCEC Credit Union,  205 E. 6th Avenue,  Vancouver, B.C.

The first is  a letter from Isobel Kiborn, "Looking at  both sides now," in the February Kinesis.  The second is an article by Margo Dunn,  "Is there a place for men in the women's  movement?" in Kinesis, November 1980.  The issues are related, as the letter from  Isobel was a response to Margo's article.  In the letter Isobel suggests:  * That Margo.'s article expressing Margo's  opinion about a 'local action group' —  Men Against Rape — should not have been  published until Kinesis checked for accuracy with the group.  * That space should be provided by Kinesis  in the same issue  for the local action  group to reply.  I don't like these suggestions. Here are  some reasons why:  * Margo is entitled to her opinion. That  is what her article was — an opinion. You  may disagree with an opinion. You may  think it's wrong. But how do you check it  for accuracy? Who is going to be the judge?  We need to know the opinions of women. The  opinions may not be popular or "constructive", but they are the basis of belief  that guides actions. We have to know them  or we will not know each other.  Women have been conditioned not to speak  their thoughts or to take themselves or  their political opinions seriously. Therefore, we need all the encouragement we can  get to help us to overcome our training.  The suggestion put forward by Isobel would  just create another obstacle that women  would have to jump over in order to express  themselves..  There is one paper in this city where feminists can express their opinions. There  are many, many places where men can express  theirs. Night and day on radio and tv and  in newspapers we are inundated and saturated by male opinions. Males from the left  and the right and the centre have far more  access to publication than women do.  I would have been more enlightened by Isobel 's letter if she had addressed herself  to Margo's article and explained why she  thought Margo's article "contained not one  fact about Men Against Rape" and was "mostly attack by innuendo."  Open discussion is the way I believe that  we can educate each other. We do not need  to be always right, nor do we need more  censorship.  We need more discussion and more willingness to take risks and to be direct with  each other.  The Man Question  Now to answer Margo's question, "Is there  a place for men inside the women's movement ? "  My answer to that question is, No.  However, I do believe that there is a place  for Men Against Rape in our society. I not  only think that there is a place for such  a group, I think that there is a great  need for it.  It is time that men took responsibility  for their behaviour and for the behaviour  of their brothers.  Men are proud of the acheivements of their  brothers who were great union leaders, and  great freedom fighters and so on. They  take credit for the behaviour of their  sex. They must also take the blame...for  the great child molesters, the incestuous  fathers, the rapists, the murderers and  oppressors of women and children.  They must look to the causes of this behaviour and put energy into stopping it.  We constantly demand that societal institutions change the ways they mold our girl  children. Men against sexism and rape must  lead the way in preventing the socialization of young boys into rapists and murderers. Instead of helping the victims, they  must stop the attackers.  I don't believe it was useless  If I read Margo right, she implied that the  anti-war movement both here and in the U.S.  was a useless effort. I don't believe that  to be true.  I think the anti-war movement played a big  part in ending the war in Vietnam. The American people who took responsibility for  naming the evil actions of their government and who were willing to fight inside  their own country helped to stop the slaughter of people thousands of miles away.  I believe that this is a model that men  against rape and sexism must follow, if  they wish to stop their brothers murdering  and raping women. They must fight within  their unions, their legal systems and their  governments.  It is also a model that I, as a white woman, need to examine in order to fight the  racism within myself and within other white  women.  Margo seems to be saying that men cannot  fight sexism. Does that mean that I, as  a white woman, cannot fight racism?  I think it is fair to criticize the way men  fight against rape or against sexist power.  But a flat condemnation is not very useful.  I am trying to learn to fight against racism and I hope that people of colour will  criticize, but not condemn me, when I fail  to do so in a beneficial manner.  Clearly, I don't necessarily agree with  Margo.  I say 'necessarily' because I had  a hard time trying to understand exactly  what it was that Margo was saying.  Nevertheless, I would be very upset if Kinesis operated in the way Isobel suggested.  I also know that Kinesis has been criticized in the past for running an article  about an all-women group without also running, in the same issue, a response from  that group.  I want to say that I support Kinesis in  its stand.  I hope Kinesis will continue to inform us.  And I hope we will continue to be strong  enough to be able«to express our differences. If we are going to have a feminist  paper then we must have freedom of feminist thought.  Yours in sisterhood,  Dorrie Brannock Q  Give Kinesis a piece of your mind and answer the questions  1. How did you get this issue of Kinesis?  Subscribe? Bought it? Passed along from a  friend?  2. If you're a subscriber, how did you come  to take out a subscription?  3. If you buy your Kinesis, where do you buy  it? Why?  4. How many people will read this copy?  5. Do you know of people who are familiar  with Kinesis but don't read it? What do you  think their reasons are?  6. What are the first things you read when  you open a new copy of Kinesis?  7. Kinesis runs a lot of feature articles. Are  there too many? Are they too long?  8. Have there been feature articles in Kinesis  that you remember wishing weren't there?  Which ones?  9. Do you wish that Kinesis would print news  items that at present it doesn't? What, for  example?  10. Which news items do you read? Local  News? Across Canada? International?  11. Do you ever save the centre features  from Kinesis? If so, do you find a use for  them?  12. Do you read Kinesis reviews of cultural  events? Would you like to see more  emphasis in Kinesis on cultural work?  13. Do you read the Letters Page and the  Movement Reports sections? Would you like  to see a heavier emphasis on 'in movement'  debate? Why or why not?  14. Do you depend upon the Bulletin Board  for information about community events? Do  you get your Kinesis in time to use the Bulletin Board information?  15. Kinesis cannot afford first class mailing.  This means that Bulletin Board notes may  not reach you in time. Do you think we  should, in view of this frustrating fact, consider abandoning the Bulletin Board?  16. How often does something in Kinesis  lead you into a discussion with others?  17. Has Kinesis ever directly prompted you  to  —write a letter to a member of the government?  —attend a rally or other political event?  —make a donation to a defence fund?  —become involved in some action group  which you weren't already involved in?  18. Have you ever considered writing an article for Kinesis?  Do you feel free to send something in?  If not, why not?  19. Does the material in Kinesis appear repetitive? If so, can you remember some  examples?  20. Does Kinesis duplicate the work of other  feminist publications?  21. From reading Kinesis, do you conclude  that its audience is composed of:  —women from the "women's community"?  —people who might not otherwise have contact with the women's movement?  Which of these two groups do you consider  should be Kinesis' main constituency?  Why?  22. Should Kinesis use different journalistic  standards from those adopted by the  'straight' media?  How would you describe these differences?  23. What areas need immediate improvement in Kinesis? What long-term goals  should Kinesis be developing and why?  We 'd appreciate it very much if you 'd  send in your answers, so that we can  learn from them and share them in print.
