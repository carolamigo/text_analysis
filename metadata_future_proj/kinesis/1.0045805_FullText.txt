In January, after months of  lobbying at city hall, Vancouver City Council agreed to  seek funding from senior levels of government for a city-  operated transition house for  battered women and their  children.  "A government-operated house,"  said Megan Ellis, spokesperson  for the occupation, "has always been our central demand.  City support for this means  that government is again recognizing its responsibility  to battered women. It means  the new house will have financial stability and will be,  in the best sense of the  word, community-based, with  accountability from elected  officials. Qf course, it  will also mean the house will  be staffed by unionized  workers with decent pay and  working conditions. Most importantly it means that wife  battering is once again recognized as a social rather  than an individual problem."  Council voted five to three  in favour of the city-operated house, which must acquire the majority of its  operating funds from the provincial and federal governments. COPE, along with Alderman Bellamy, fully supported  the occupiers' demand. Alder-  people Ford, Brown, and  Campbell voted against the  motion.  Another motion, which passed unanimously, called for  the city to communicate with  senior levels of government  about the need for more services for battered women in  Vancouver.  According to a nationwide  survey by the city's social  planning department, Vancouver has the lowest ratio  of beds for battered women  per general population in  Canada.  "There was no debate about  the need for more services  in Vancouver. The council  was split only on who should  provide the service, private societies or government," said Ellis.  "Our chances of receiving  the funding are excellent.  The statistics clearly show  the service is needed, and  it will be extremely difficult for governments to argue that Vancouver deserves  fewer beds than the rest of  Canada."  According to Ellis, 59 women and children have found  shelter at the house during  the occupation,  Over one hundred women have  done shifts at the house and  on the crisis line, and over  $10,000 has been raised to  keep the house supplied, said  Ellis.  She says the thought of closing the house is a painful  one to all the women involved  in the occupation.  "All of us hate the idea of  closing down the shelter. But  by the time we close, we will  have been running for eight  months entirely on volunteer.  We simply cannot maintain  that for any longer. It is  time for others to take on  the work of providing service  to battered women."  "We have struggled to run one  of the most demanding women's  services, all on a volunteer  basis, and all while we have  had other commitments to  jobs, families, and school.  On top of that work we have  fought to keep the problem  of battered women visible in  our community and have organized politically to win our  demands at city council. We  Vancouver women voted to  Canada's abortion laws. See page 8 for story.  know that when we close the  doors in a month's time it  will be one of the most painful moments in our lives."  Ellis added that the transition house crisis line will  still be staffed and operating 24 hours a day.  "Women in the occupation,"  she said, "simply couldn't  cope with the thought of a  woman in crisis calling our  number and being told it was  disconnected. We will be  there for advice, as a resource centre, for information and to stay in touch  with the situation and  needs of battered women in  Vancouver."  The occupiers, and other  women's groups, she said,  will continue in the next  months to build community  support and maintain the  political pressure on all  levels of government for  the new service.  "We have every confidence that  we can build on this victory  to establish a city-operated  transition house for battered  women."  Women interested in supporting  the occupation in any way,  be  it with timej oash, or food  donations, should call 876-  2849 or write P.O.  Box 4237,  Vancouver, BC V6B 3Z7.

Robins evades responsibility for Shield  by Eunice Brooks  April 30, 1986 is the last  chance for anyone who wants  to make a claim for damages  against A.H. Robins, manufacturer of the Dalkon Shield,  the intrauterine device commonly used in the seventies  by women in over 80 countries.  Those who file later will  have no hearing. This date  has not been widely publicized.  Lawsuits against the company  contend that the design of the  shield allowed bacteria to  enter the uterus through the  strings of the IUD, and  •caused PID, blood poisoning,  infections, sterility, and  spontaneous abortions.  In June 1970, A.H. Robins  of Richmond, Virginia, began  marketing the Dalkon Shield.  It has since been learned that  the team of doctors whd  developed the device used  false research statistics  to have it approved. The  Robins people withdrew the  shield in 1974, but by then  over 2.4 million had been  sold in the United States and  another 2.8 million in other  countries, including Canada.  Some 1.7 million Canadian women  bought and wore the shield.  So far the shield has been  linked to the deaths of 16  women in the United States.  These women developed complications after miscarriages,  caused by uterine infections.  Outside of Canada and the  United States there are still  women using the shield. No  claims have been filed from  Africa, India,' or South America.  Robins will be allowed a class  action status, in which all  claims will be settled in one  trial. Thirty-eight lawyers  will represent all the women  and infants harmed by the IUD.  District Court Judge Mehidge,  a near neighbor of the president of Robins Company, will  preside over the suit. He  has declared April 30, 1986,  as the cutoff date.  Dalkon Shield use has also  been linked to tubal abcess,  peritonitis, septicemia,  ectopic pregnancy, brain  damage in newborns, and death.  But only the legal verified  claims will be used in court  against the H.A. Robins  Company. It was due to the constant pressure of women's  groups that Robins made the  move to recall the shield.  Robins immediately went into  bankruptcy. Women are convinced the bankruptcy is a  good way of side-stepping  responsibility for the damage  Action Alert for Women, a  San Francisco-based advocacy group,  is launching an  international outreach campaign to alert women to the  claim filing deadline. They  will provide information to  assist women who need the device removed, need to file  claims and will offer necessary referrals.

'^ld%B0jJ£Mirced  to increase our price  - SSreeiPWer the past year, the financial viability of Kinesis  has been  steadily eroded by rising costs. A  financial analysis of our income versus expenses, undertaken in November,  showed us that the paper was losing  63 cents per paper per issue.  As we circulate 2,000 copies, this  means that we are losing over $1,000  per issue. Over ten issues this  means a projected deficit of $10,000.  No matter how we looked at it, this  deficit could not be eradicated by  increased sales and advertising.  Since November we have concentrated  on ways to cut our costs. To bring our  typesetting bills under control  (they were hitting $500 monthly), we  invested $400 in a Compugraphic head-  liner, which means we can handle virtually all typesetting in-house.  Costs related to typesetting, such  as travel, have also been drastically,  reduced.  We have decided to limit the paper's  size to 32 pages per issue and to reduce supplements from 10 a year to 5  a year. These decisions will mean  significant savings in printing and  postage costs, and we'll reduce our  losses to 37 cents per paper per  issue, for a total loss of $720 monthly.  Along with a cover and subscription  price increase, we will be increasing  our advertising rates by 12 percent.  These revenue increases will bring  our losses to 10 cents per paper per  issue, for a total loss of $200  monthly.

We are very aware that some women will,  be hardpressed to absorb this price  increase. If this increase makes you  believe you simply cannot afford  Kinesis,  please write us for a subscription anyway.  Kinesis  has always offered "pay  what you can" subscriptions.  We would also urge women who are in  good shape financially to consider  adding extra dollars to their subscriptions so Kinesis  can continue to offer  lower rates to women who need them.

When the applause and  laughter died down, she continued: "Our slogan should  be, 'We have  the work; we  want  the money!" not 'We are  the problem; we want the  problem-solvers.' We know  what we need. We  are the  experts!"  The Women's Economic Agenda  group is one of the latest  organizing efforts to spring  from a variety of feminist  and community groups in the  Lower Mainland, such as  BCPIRG, ERICA, End Legislated  Poverty, Womanskills and  Wages for Housework, to  name a few. WEA aims to create  a women's economic agenda before the next B.C. election  to force women's issues to the  forefront and to exert a real  voting pressure on candidates to support them.  -^^^  Some of the topics discussed  at the January meeting were  the problems of younger women,  of women who live below the poverty line and of women whose  work as homemakers goes unrecognized by government  pension plans; and the lack  of daycare, the lack of  support for women who wish  to extend their education  and the lack of money for  research into women's health  issues.  In the long term, the discussion and fact-finding  around the compilationrof  the agenda will help us to  educate ourselves and each  other, and to develop broad-  based support for our common  issues. WEA plans to build  women's block organizations  throughout the Lower Mainland to reach out to women  who are not yet politicized.  The impetus for the WEA in  Vancouver came from the example  of women's groups in California,, who compiled one for the  1984 election. Their agenda's  title page makes their direction clear: "Two out of every  three adults in poverty are  women. What if we were all to  go to the polls?"  The California women decided  they could gain leverage for  women's issues by exploiting the.  politicians' fear of the gender  'he provincial government's attacks on the education system were overwhelmingly  repudiated by Vancouver citizens'resounding vote in support of COPE school trustees.

In the States, pollsters have  discovered that more women  vote than do men, and their  voting crosses age, race,  religion and political parties.  Women were far more likely to  think that Ronald Reagan was  doing a bad job as president  and to vote against him.  In Canada similar trends have  been noticed, including Women's  tendency to vote for candidates with liberal attitudes.  WEA's next meeting will begin  with groups and individuals  making presentations to iden-  ailable resources.  As another participant told  the January meeting, "When I  ask myself whether or not my  group has the energy to  work on this, I say yes,  we have the energy if it  makes the struggle that we  now have easier. We will if  it means more people are  supporting our demands."  WEA welcomes your input at  their next meeting on Sunday, February 16, beginning  at 12:30 p.m. at the Ray  Cam Community Centre. Childcare will be provided on  site, and it is wheelchair  accessible.  Hookers face greater dangers  as police sweep the streets  by Gretchen Lang  Across Canada, hookers and  Johns dodge police as the new  anti-soliciting law, Bill C49,  goes into effect.  The new federal law enables  police to arrest anyone who is  disrupting pedestrian or vehicular traffic or is communicating or attempting to communicate with anybody to sell or  buy sex in a public place, including a motor vehicle.  One group that stongly criticizes the bill (see Kinesis  Dec. '85) is the B.C. Civil  Liberties Association. Spokesperson for the association,  John Russell, says the bill infringes on freedoms set down  in the Charter of Rights,  and in fact hems in a legal  activity (prostitution) by a  criminal offence.  "I think you'll see it challenged very quickly in court."  he said.  Meanwhile the Alliance for the  Safety of Prostitutes has challenged the law in the streets.  ASP hosted a "Wave In" in  January to protest the passing  of the law. Similar protests  were held in Calgary, Winnipeg  and Toronto. Protestors lined  the streets, flagging down passing men, an action now considered illegal if interpreted by  police as solicitation.  ASP organizer Marie Arrington  says working conditions for  Vancouver street prostitutes  are increasingly dangerous as  police, backed by the new  law, sweep the streets of hookers and Johns.  Prostitutes and their customers  are now arrested nightly in  the downtown east side and  Mt. Pleasant areas. Police  report 76 charged to date,  including 27 tricks.  Arrington says police are  tracking prostitutes from  cars, alleys and rooftops,  often posing as prostitutes  or clients themselves to  catch hookers and Johns  "communicating in order to  buy or sell sex."  "There are more cops out there  than women," she remarked.  Deputy Police Chief Ted Lister  confirmed that the new police  squad set up to enforce the  law was largely formed of undercover men and focused on individuals known to be prostitutes.  "Let's face it," he said; "We  know the prostitutes are. They  tell us."  Arrington maintains that; police  go further to determine who  prostitutes are by following  women home, questioning neighbours and bribing other hookers  for information.  "Violence has also definitely  increased," said Arrington  citing one recent case where a  prostitute was bound, gagged  with a sock and held at knifepoint in a car. Hitchhiking  is one way women find to escape  police attention.  How poor are Canadian women?  1. One woman out of every six lives in povetty in Canada,  2.

According to prostitutes interviewed in the Globe and Mail,  the new laws scare off their  regular customers and force them  to rely for income on Johns  who they would not normally go  with, customers the prostitutes  describe as "obviously weird."  John Russell was also outspoken  about the dangers inherent in  the law to prostitutes and  their clients.  "They (prostitutes) may turn  to organized crime to protect  them because they can no longer go to the police."  When asked where prostitutes  would go now that they and  their clients are being pushed  off the streets, Arrington  said, "They'll go anywhere they  can, but most have nowhere."  Minors, she noted, have the  hardest time because they are  unable to seek shelter in bars.  "And women are getting criminal  records now," she said. This  decreases their chances for leg  itimate employment.  Mayor Mike Harcourt has repeatedly applauded the bill as a  solution to resident complaints  about hookers disrupting their  neighbourhoods. As quoted by  the Sun,   Harcourt says that  street solicitation has harmed  people very badly.  Mount Pleasant Action Group  spokesperson Phyllis Alfeld expressed her approval of the  police crackdown but was dismayed that only two arrests  were made in her area. As  she said in the Sun,  "One or two is not acceptable,"  she said, "We don't want any  prostitutes working in Mount  Pleasant at all." 4   Kinesis February 1986  CONFERENCES  DisAbled feminists plan March meeting  The first west coast conference solely for disabled  women will be held March  21 to 23 in Surrey, at Camp  Alexandra, Crescent Beach.  The Disabled Women's Network  (DAWN) B.C. Chapter, wants  to gather as many women with  handicaps as possible. The  idea is to have activist feminist women who can and will  return to other regions within the province and in the  Yukon, and to bring other women  into the DAWN network.  Camp Alexandra has a capacity  for 65 sleep-overs, including at least 27 wheelchairs.  There is an elevator and  even a wheelchair-accessible shower. Thought is being  given to preparations for  women who need to bring  attendants, nurses, guide  dogs and, naturally, children. Diets for those with  special needs are also a consideration. Transportation is  being arranged.  DAWN (B.C.) is a group"in the  birth process, and is in existence in B.C. mainly due to  the work of Joan Meister and  Jillian Ridington (see September Kinesis  for details.)  This conference is expected to  be the true moment of birth  for the provincial network.  Nelson hosts Women and Words  Headlining this year's exciting Women and Words conference  are such well-known names as  Paulette Jils, winner of the  Governor General's award for  poetry last year; Eleanor  Wachtel, freelance writer and  broadcaster, and moderator of  the political debate on women's  issues, held on CBC last year;  plus well-known poets Daphne  Marlatt and Betsy Warland.  The conference will be held on  the former DTUC campus in Nelson on March 21, 22 and 23,  and will bring together a  wide variety of Kootenay  women who work with words  in many capacities, such as  writers, broadcasters, journalists, poets, teachers, counsellors, librarians and politicians.  Accommodation will be available  on the DTUC campus, and included in the registration  fee are meals, entertainment,  workshops, films, readings,  daycare if it is required,  and a Friday evening introductory wine and cheese party.  Scheduled workshops this year  include electronic desktop  publishing, film and video  making, and communicating women's issues in the community, ai  well as workshops on poetry,  fiction writing, writing for  "glossy" magazines, community  theatre and community broadcasting.  Kootenay Women and Words, the  sponsor of the conference, is  a branch of the Pan Canadian  Women and Words Association,  and members from Vancouver,  Toronto and other parts of  Canada have indicated a  strong interest in this conference . It will enable women  who work with words and ideas  in many capacities to network and  to share ideas and information.  This conference will build upon  the very successful conference  held last year in Creston and  promises an exciting and  creative weekend for those  attending.  Women wishing to receive more  information, or to get their  names on the mailing list for  registration forms can contact either Luanne Armstrong,  Box 3, Sirdar, B.C. VOB 2C0,  phone 866-5264, or Sherrie  Konigsberg, R.R. 1, Winlaw,  B.C. (phone 226-7654).  Dykes and faggots from pride to power  'From Pride to Power, the Third  Annual B.C. Gay and Lesbian  Conference, will be held at  the UBC campus on February 14-  16. Building on two previous  conferences, this year's  conference has been divided  into four major tracks: the  charter of rights and freedoms,  censorship and pornography,  AIDS and students. The tracks  allow for exposure to a broad  range of issues as well as  assisting those who wish to  pursue an issue in depth.  Charter track workshops will  examine charter law and challenges, social framework, cultural/religious and employment.  Members of the Committee on  Equality Rights, MP Svend  Robinson, MP Sheila Finestone  and MP Mary Collins, will take .  part in a "Strategies For  Change" forum on Sunday.  The censorship and pornography  track will allow conference  participants to share concerns  and personal experiences  with both issues. A workshop  on the negative aspects of  pornography will provide an  opportunity for people to  view images of both straight  and gay pom, and will be  followed by one on problems  with and alternatives to  censorship. Sunday workshops  include one focused on exploring lesbian sexuality.  The workshop on AIDS includes  a medical update, human  rights and AIDS, and a woman's  perspective on AIDS.  The student track will bring  together people from campuses  and schools throughout the  Pacific northwest and western  Canada with workshops on  lesbian and gay issues and the  university media, concerns of  lesbian and gay youth, and peer  counselling skills, as well  as a session on working in  mixed organizations.  The conference begins Friday,  Feb. 15, evening with a talk  on lesbian and gay history at  the Vancouver Gay and Lesbian  Community Centre by Gary Kinsman.  Victoria archivist Indiana  Matters will present "Unfit  for Publication": Notes  Towards a Lavender History  of British Columbia." This talk  is open to people not attending  the conference.  A banquet will be held on Saturday evening, with entertainment by the Vancouver  Men's Chorus, followed by the  traditional Valentine's Ball,  organized by Gays and Lesbians of  of UBC.  The pre-registration deadline  is February 4, and you must  pre-register to attend the  banquet. Child care and signing  for the hearing-impaired will  be provided with advance notice. All campus facilities  are wheelchair accessible.  For more information and  other events at UBC's Lesbian/  Gay Pride week, check the  Kinesis  bulletin board.  Topics that will be discussed  in workshops will likely include matters of concern to  all women, such as poverty and  isolation, but it is expected  that groups will meet to discuss accessibility to the  women's movement and services  to women, violence against  women:with disabilities, affir  mative action, assertive-  ness, self-image, sexuality  and parenting.  Many disabled women are  isolated and poor, yet they  feel ready, willing and  able to get into the women's  movement if a way is made  possible for them to do so.  DAWN plans to begin advocacy  work, educating the community  to our needs. It is expected  that the conference will generate memberships, ideas,  excitement, and a list of  priorities to work on. It  is also hoped that a lasting  bond will form between women  who have suffered alone for  too long.  DAWN embraces physically and  mentally handicapped women,  as well as women with hidden  disabilities such as agoraphobia. DAWN is prepared to  accommodate the visually and  hearing impaired at the conference .  Sorryy no men once the conference is underway on Friday  afternoon.  If you want to participate,  you can have a pre-conference  information package mailed  to you after you register  by phone.  The collect number to call  is 435-2884—and ask for  Marlene. Be prepared to  tell Marlene your disability  and special needs when you  call.  Get ready for our 11th I WD!  Come one, come allI Whether  this is your first International Women's Day or another  in a series of many IWDs  you have worked long and hard  to produce, YOU ARE WELCOME!  This year's theme is "A Celebration of Vancouver's 11th  Annual International Women's  Day." We celebrate the work  of the women's movement in  Vancouver, and we highlight  this year as the 11th  consecutive year of women  taking to the streets in  celebration of IWD.  This year's International  Women's Day will include a  parade and rally, at which  Jessie Duarte from South  Africa will speak abbut  being a woman of colour living under an apartheid regime. Jessie will be speaking  here in Vancouver and then  flying to Victoria to participate in Victoria's IWD.  Other speakers at the rally  will talk about Rape Relief,  WAVAW, Urban Images for  Native Women, lesbianism and  The B.C. Federation of Labour Women's committee. The  Euphonious Feminists,  Lynn McGowan, and Aya will pro^  vide entertainment.  The Information Day and  workshops will take place  at the Carnegie Centre and  the Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre. Workshops will discuss Women of the Right,  lesbian women, disabled  women, and women of colour.  Also, the film "Speaking Our  Peace" will be shown.  The International Women's Day  dance will be held Friday,  March 7, at Capri Hall,  Fraser Avenue (women only).  For more information, watch  the streets for posters and  check out VSW, Women in Focus,  and La Quena for brochures.  If you would like further  information, or would like  to be involved in the organizing .committee, please call  324-5460. See you March 8!  Come and celebrate! Kinesis February 1986   5  ACROSS BC  MediaWatch  Less sexism, more women  by Susan Prosser  An ad which has enraged you for weeks  or months suddenly disappears from  the bus, a magazine or television.  If the ad portrayed women in a derogatory, violent or sexist way, it  'ñ∫probably disappeared due to the  efforts of MediaWatch (the national  watch on images of women in the  media). In its three years of existence, MediaWatch has responded to  women's increasing awareness of sex-  role stereotyping in all areas of  the media: print, radio and television advertising, and programming.  As MediaWatch rethinks its approach  to monitoring advertising and programming, and as the CRTC hearings  oh self-regulation draw nearer (see  Kinesis Dec. '85), it seems important to examine some of its successes  as well as its current activities.  In October of '84 Pepsi released a  television ad for diet Pepsi which  showed two girls getting ready for  a date. The "date" turned out to be  their father, and the implication  was unquestionably incestuous. When  complaints were filed with the  Advertising Advisory Board (AAB),  they denied the commercial had anything to do with incest.  At the same time, MediaWatch and other  groups such as Incest Survivors and  Children's Aid began contacting  people both within Pepsi and within  the agency responsible for producing the ad. When this failed to  impress on Pepsi the seriousness of  their ad's innuendo, Pepsi was asked  for a list of all TV stations in  Canada airing the commercial. They  refused to provide this information.  MediaWatch carefully prepared an  educational package which outlined  its correspondence with Pepsi and  an analysis of why it was imperative that the ad be discontinued.  This package was mailed to over  200 women's groups across the  country. Through their many  threads of contact, sufficient support was mobilized and Pepsi finally withdrew its ad.  An October '85 issue of" TV Guide  contained an ad for Comp-u-Car wljich  showed a woman in a bathing suit and  high-heeled boots leaning over the  hood of a car. This computer-search  "car" ad displayed more woman than  car and read "Call Me" above the  photo and "Free and Easy" below.  Women, particularly mothers, were  outraged that this ad could appear  in a magazine as widely read as TV    -  Guide.   In this case, a few phone calls  from MediaWatch revealed that a slipup  had been made because the ad was  submitted late and had escaped normal scrutiny. Apologies were profuse,  and the ad did not appear again.  When TV Guide  contacted Comp-u-Car  about the ad, they responded: "Then  you don't want our advertising?"  "No," was TV Guide's  decisive answer.  In 1984 an ad showing a woman sitting  against a tree with her shirt, unbuttoned to the navel appeared in the  Nelson Daily News.  An axe was lodged  in the tree beside the woman's head  and an apple sat on a stump beside  her knees. The ad was for Head's  Boots. The AAB agreed with complaints  about the ad, but the editor of the  Nelson newspaper was less than suppor-  tive of their criticism: he reprinted  the ad on the front page of the Nelson  Daily News and wrote an editorial condemning "women's hysteria."  The Nelson Women's Centre lodged a complaint with the B.C. Press Council  about the editorial. MediaWatch accom^  panied representatives from the Women's  Centre to a B.C. Press Council hearing  in Vancouver. The Press Council upheld  the complaint, and their decision was  printed in the Nelson Daily News.   This  result was significant because.it  showed the community this type of advertising is not "okay."  MediaWatch is presently involved in a  struggle with the Ron Zalco Fitness  Connection. Although the AAB supports  the' protest against Zalco's ads, public  pressure has not yet been strong enough  to force Zalco to stop using advertising which defines women's health in  terms of their sexual attractiveness.  MediaWatch is considering picketing  and other more direct methods of  pressuring Ron Zalco.  MediaWatch has had many programming  successes as well. Often a broadcaster  responds to complaints about comments  or content by publicly apologizing. The  larger problem MediaWatch has with  programming, however, is not so much  what is aired, but what isn't. MediaWatch .is involved in an ongoing campaign to realize a balance of female  and male broadcasters. As well, there  is a great need for more coverage of  women's events and women's issues.  For instance, the CBC refused to send  a foregn correspondent to cover the  Nairobi conference. Events focused on  women and women's sports are simply  not considered newsworthy by a great  majority of the media.  To increase your own awareness, here  are examples of two ads which MediaWatch is now targeting for action:  a Campbell's Soup television commercial shows a young girl playing mommy  to her father, and a final coy shot  implies that she plays lover too. Virtually every bus in Vancouver displays  a ghoulish Phantom pantyhose ad  showing a woman lying on her belly  partially clothed.  As our awareness of the pervasiveness  of sex-role stereotyping increases, so  does the work of MediaWatch. If you have  opinions, comments or complaints, send  them to MediaWatch: their voice is  made stronger by ours.  White Spot forces strike vote  by Sharon Knapp  The Food and Service Workers of Canada  (FASWOC) have called a strike vote for  the end of January in response to  White Spot's imposition of a contract  that has already been rejected by 70  percent of its workers.  The imposition of the contract came in  mid-January after a break in negotiations with FASWOC, which represents  1,200 B.C. White Spot employees, 70  percent of whom are women. The contract  contains a two-tier wage system that was  part of the company's proposals on November  7th but was dropped from a later offer in  December. The December offer was rejected  by a large majority of employees because  of other unacceptable provisions.  Under the previous contract, waitresses  start at $3.65 an hour and move to $6.75  an hour after six months. Under the November 7 contract, waitresses will only go  up to $6.25 an hour.  By the end of the contract, waitresses  starting in November will receive $1  less per hour because they will not receive any of the increments accruing  to older employees. The two-tier wage  system has been attacked by FASWOC as  an attempt to undermine union solidarity. The union argues that the company  will call in cheaper employees and  give them more hours^  White Spot has had lockout notices in  effect throughout negotiations, but  despite threats has been reluctant  to jeopardize their restaurant business by locking workers out.  "This imposition was their only alternative to giving us what we want,"  said FASWOC president and Nanaimo White  Spot waitress Cindy Hilborne.  She cited a recent case involving the  Packard Company which is now before the  Supreme Court, where the Labour Board  upheld the company's right to impose  a contract in a similar situation.  In an earlier identical case, the  Labour Board had ruled in favour of the  union and disallowed the contract.  "They've declared war," said Hilborne.  "Imposition makes a mockery of collective  bargaining."  The company literature distributed to  employees says they are imposing a contract with reference "to our final  offer of November 7, which could lead  employees to believe that they are now  working under the final offer of  December, which did not contain a two-  tier wage system.  The imposed contract also contains the  4-9-D provision which FASWOC workers  have rejected all along. "4-9-D virtually places the entire workforce on  call," said Hilborne. "The company (now)  has the right to call you at home and  shorten or lengthen your shift or cancel it entirely, as long as they get  you at home the day before or I before  you leave for work. If you were working  a 5-11:30 night shift, they could call  you at 8 o'clock in the morning and say,  "You're on dayshift now. you have an  hour to get here or you'll lose your  day's pay." Many of our women are  mothers who need babysitters or daycare. If they can't arrange it, they  lose their day's work."  FASWOC has filed a complaint with the  Labour Board alleging that the company  is bargaining in bad faith and is attempting to bargain directly with the employees rather than the union.  The Labour Board ruling may be affected  by the fact that White Spot is a corpor-  age sponsor of Expo and is building a  350-seat restaurant on the site. Premier  Bennett has indicated to the companies  involved in Expo that he wants all labour  disputes solved before the fair opens  less than 100 days from now. g 6   Kinesis February 1986  ACROSS CANADA  Supreme Court decisions hailed by LEAF  Employers can be found to be  discriminating against an  employee even though they  didn't mean to do it, the  Supreme Court of Canada  has ruled.  In two key human rights  judgments yesterday,  Canada's top court effectively widened the definition of discrimination by  saying that employers' rules  and practices can discriminate against some people  even if the intent was not  discriminatory.  The court also ruled, however,- that a practice that  is unintentionally discriminatory should be struck  down only when the employer  has failed to take reasonable steps to deal with  this type of discrimination.  In one of the two cases, the  court ruled unanimously  that Theresa O'Mallery, a  former full-time saleswoman  with Simpson-Sears Ltd. in  Kingston, Ont., had been discriminated against when she  was forced to accept a part-  time job because her membership in the Seventh-Day Ad-  ventist Church prohibited  her from working on Saturdays .  Lawyer says 'almighty tractor' still reigns  Proposed changes to the  Saskatchewan law governing  the division of property at  the end of a marriage have  drawn the organized opposition of provincial feminists,  human rights activists, farm  women and other groups.  The proposals include the exemption of gifts and inheritances from division, exemption of the premarriage value  of a couple's home, exclusion of the increased value  of property in some circumstances, and increased grounds  for postponing the division  of property.  The proposals would also allow  a judge to consider the contribution made by either spouse  where there has been "a willing and total failure to  contribute anything at all"  to the partnership of marriage.  That the law leaves the door  open for judges to measure  the contribution of each  spouse to a marriage is a  major irritant to opponents.  "Men ride around and around  in the field on the almighty  tractor" while women perform a variety of duties,  said Saskatoon lawyer Sandra  Mitchell, a spokesperson for  Saskatchewan Matrimonial  Property Coalition.  But "when judges look at  contribution, they never  see women's contribution as  being anywhere near equal  to men's," she said.  Measuring contributions will  "go right back to the pre-  Groups seek amendment  to affirmative action bill  An unprecedented alliance of  interest groups is bringing  pressure on the Conservative  government to withdraw its  proposed employment equity  legislation, Bill C-62.  The bill is an effort to  provide affirmative action  . opportunities in federally  regulated business, Crown  corporations and some federal departments.  The National Action Committee  on the Status of Women, the  Canadian Labour Congress,  the Canadian Association  for Community Living, the  Ontario-based Urban Alliance  on Race Relations and others  have joined to seek amendment  to the bill.  "The exciting thing is that  all these groups are beginning to see that*we have a  tremendous amount in common  and that as an alliance we  have a tremendous amount of  power," said Judy Rebick,  an alliance organizer.  "I think this alliance is  going to continue to fight  on other equality issues. I  think they're going to be  sorry they brought us together ."  Critics say the bill is inadequate because it includes  no enforcement mechanism and  no contract compliance for  companies doing business with,  the federal government, and  excludes such large federal  departments as Defence and  Public Works.  Brian Grant, a spokesman for  Employment Minister Flora  MacDonald, said the minister  believes the employment equity  bill strikes a fair balance  between the competing interests of employers and disadvantaged groups.  "Ms. MacDonald is prepared to  make some amendments to the  bill," he said, "but with a  bill of this kind there is  bound to be a certain amount  of opposition. The minister is  aware of this."  Members of the alliance believe  they may have the government on  the run and hope to see their  criticisms addressed in the  amendments.  "This has to be the first  time in Canada that target  groups, victims suffering  : discrimination, have come  together to work toward reducing the problem," said  Carol Taylor, president of  the Urban Alliance on Race  Relations.  "It's really a watershed in  Canada. We're already seeing  that it's having an impact.  MacDonald is already talking  about some amendments. I  think she is feeling the  pressure."  Murdoch era," she said. In  1973 Irene Murdoch lost her  claim to half the Alberta  ranch where she had lived  with her husband.  Although she testified that  she had done haying, raking,  swathing, dehorning, vaccinating, branding and "anything that was to be done,"  the Supreme Court of Canada  denied her a share of the  ranch, ruling that she had  done the work of "any ranch.  wife."  But Ken Hodges, director of  research for the Law Reform  Commission, said critics  have misunderstood the commission's recommendations.  "There's to be no distinction  between the nature of a con-  tibution. It doesn't matter  if the wife, is home working.,  and the husband is out working ."  The recommendations would  allow judges to consider each  spouse's contribution only  in cases where one of them  fails to contribute at all,  he said.  In the other decision, the  court was split in turning  down the appeal of K.S.  Bhinder of Toronto, a  Sikh who lost his job with  CN Rail because he refused  for religious- reasons to remove his turban and wear a  hard hat in accordance with  company safety rules.  Gordon Fairweather, head of  the federal Human Rights  Commission, said he was disappointed and surprised the  court had found that the rules  could not be made to accomodate Mr. Bhinder.  The ruling,"Fairweather said,  will be potentially devastating for disabled people working for the government.  The Bhinder decision removes  the possibility that individuals' working conditions  can be adjusted to their needs,  he said. Employers often have  to make small accommodations  for disabled workers.  Despite the loss in the Bhinder case, advocates of some  minority and women's groups  yesterday hailed the rulings  as an important step in  their battle to gain equal  rights.  Shelagh Day, president of  the Women's Legal Education  and Action Fund, said that  women, the disabled and  religious, and visible minorities are among those who  will benefit from the court's  finding that discrimination  has to do with the impact  that a practice has on an  individual. This is known  as systemic or adverse discrimination.  Yukon from page 1  uninformed, and highly emotional. The flames of misunderstanding were fanned by the p  partisan politicking of  the Conservatives.  The Human Rights Act was introduced in October by the  minority NDP government.  The bill contained 12 prohibited grounds of discrimination, a clause on affirmative action and equal pay  for work of equal value, and  would have created a Yukon  human rights commission.  Initial public reaction to  the bill centred on the inclusion of sexual orientation/preference as prohibitive grounds of discrimination  ation.  By the time the Yukon  government set up a Select  Committee on Human Rights to  solicit public opinion on the  proposed bill, the section  protecting gays and lesbians  from discrimination had  received a fair bit of public  exposure. During the hearings  set up by the Select Committee,  sexual orientation received  notable support from various  community groups. Few individuals spoke against the  contentious clause. Instead  the issues become affirmative  action, the creation and powers  of a commission, and equal pay  for work of equal value. As  well, legitimate concerns  were raised dealing with the  meaning, interpretation and  application of sections of the  proposed bill.  To a large extent the death of  the bill was predetermined by  the lack of educational work  done by the government prior  to the introduction of the  bill,  The committee itself was generally uninformed and took this  lack of understanding to the  public, creating more misunderstanding and little clarification.  Prior to the release of the  bill the government did not  issue a Green Paper or any other  other educational material  on human rights.  Support for the bill was presented to the Select Committee  by various individuals and  community groups representing  labout, women, Native people  and specail needs societies.

Kinesis February 1986   7  ACROSS CANADA  People 9s Enquiry nixes  Nanoose testing range  by Shari Dunnet  In January five hundred people  gathered in Nanaimo to attend  the "people's enquiry." The  enquiry was held to look into  the implications of the Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental Testing Range  (CFMETR) at Nanoose Bay, located 20 kilometres north  of Nanaimo.  The Canada-U.S. agreement  which allows the U.S. to use  Nanoose Bay and surrounding  waters for a weapons testing range, is up for renewal  on April 14 of this year.  The intention of the enquiry  was to examine the feasibility of contract renewal.  Several papers were presented documenting the health  hazards and environmental  effects of nuclear-powered submarines and the  nuclear weaponry possibly  aboard these vessels, which  the U.S. will neither confirm  nor deny.  . One of the main areas highlighted was the lack of information available on the  base and test range. Also revealed i was the fact that no  scientific testing of rad^JjajOfc?  iation levels in the waters  occurs. One of the panelists,  Dr. Rosalie Bertell, pointed  out tha't t'he^pfesence'Jof"'ihje^,:iJ  nuclear-powered submarines  could pose a health threat  to those people in the area,  especially those who eat the  fish and shellfish from the  bay and the surrounding  waters.  The enquiry received a background paper from the Department of National Defence  that provided a history and  general description of the base  but neglected to mention such  matters as radiation levels  and safety monitoring. However, no one from the department attended the enquiry.  The Conservative and Liberal  parties and the local chamber  of commerce also declined to  attend.  The outcome of the weekend  was a decision to put pressure on the Mulroney government not to renew the Canada- •  U.S. agreement and to demand  that the U.S. identify whether  or not U.S. vessels travelling  in Canadian waters carry nuclear weaponry. It was also  agreed that a systematic testing of the radiation levels in  the water.should be set up and  monitored, and that a-public  hearing be set up to look into  CFMETR.

What's in a  name, anyway?  by Eunice Brooks  Four minutes in court is all  it took for Robert Sharpe, a  University of Toronto professor of constitutional law,  to prove that the inability  of some women to pass on surnames to their children is an  infringement of the Charter  of Rights.  Sharpe was representing  David Wright and Catherine  Paul, a married couple who  want their children to have  the surname Paul. At a registrar 's office their initial  request was refused. Now their  son has the surname Paul..  Gwen Brodsky, of the Women's  Legal Education and Action.;  Fund, which is., sponsoring  cases- of,a- similar-,nature^ in-, i  three provinces, says; . 'The  Vital Statistics Acts do not  afford women equality."  The law presumes any child  will take the surname of the  man if the mother is married  to him at the time of birth.  If a woman will not or cannot acknowledge the father,  then the child takes the  mother's surname.  Because of the Wright/Paul  appeal, women in Ontario will  be able to pass on their  surnames. This right now  also exists in British  Columbia and some other  provinces. But in British  Columbia there is no provision for hyphenated names. A  test case is before the courts  to appeal for hyphenated names.  It is presumed that any new legislation will apply to persons  not yet registered. Already  the offices of registrars are  scrambling for guidelines to  follow until new legislation  is enacted. What to do when the  parents disagree? No one has  an answer for that yet.  Ominous precedent set  by Eunice Brooks  An ominous precedent has recently been set in a case in  Ontario regarding the portion  of union dues that goes to charity.  Rose Marie McLean, a devout  Roman Catholic and a former  devout union activist, argued before an Ontario Public  Service Tribunal that she  should not have to pay the  portion of her dues that the  Ontario Public Service Employees  Union uses for charity. It amount  to some 25C monthly. McLean  launched the case because she  didn't want any of her union  dues to go to the support of pro-  choice groups.  McLean's union has not directly contributed funds to freedom of choice groups, although  at its last convention it  voted to do so. OPSEU, which  is a member of the Ontario  Federation of Labour, has  however agreed the federation  could contribute/donate $3,000  to the Ontario Coalition of  Abortion Clinics in 1984.  The Ontario tribunal said  the McLean case falls under  the religious exemption to  compulsory union dues built  into the Ontario Labour  Relations Act. It ruled she  could instead donate the  .25C monthly to a charity  of her choice.  The tribunal made it clear  that unions have a right to  take stands on social and  political issues that affect  their members, and that  unions have a right to  speak for their members.

(Tribunal witness)  The audience rose as the  judges took their seats and,  in the first of a series of  tribunals held across Canada,  Canada's abortion law was  "put on trial" for crimes  against women.  Concerned Citizens for Choice  on Abortion (CCCA) sponsored  a "speak out for choice" tribunal in Vancouver on January  25. Women came forward to  testify about their abortion  experiences in Canada before  a bench of six "judges" and  an audience acting as jury.  Prior to 1969, both abortion  and contraception were il-   Tribunal witnesses speak   For me one of the fears around pregnancy was that housing was very  scarce. We lived in rooms, which wasn't easy with small children.  My husband was a displaced person, a refugee from the war, and  could not get permanent work until he became a citizen, and when  I was pregnant it wasn't easy for me to get work. (My doctor)  fitted me with a diaphragm. It didn't provide very reliable' protection, however, because I kept on getting pregnant....  Then I read in the classified ads about a remedy for" menstrual  irregularity and wrote away for it. The remedy turned out to  be silver pills, which came in a little bottle marked "not to  be used for pregnancy." I took the dose, i:hey acted as a strong  purgative, and after extreme cramping and a feeling that I was  losing my insides, I miraculously bled. I stocked up on them.  Ann, tribunal witness  There were two particular women who had an impact on me. One was  a woman who worked with me. I didn't know her that well. But  she had an abortion one night and came to work the next day  because she didn't want to lose a day's pay. And she started  to hemorrhage. And everything was covered in blood—the walls,  the ceilings, the filing cabinets. That had an impact on me.  Astra, tribunal witness  A receptionist phoned a few days later and gave me an appointment in five weeks.   I couldn't believe it. I begged for something sooner. This pregnancy was too traumatic. It was disrupting my whole life. Every week a woman waits increases the  danger of the surgery.  written testimony from a "woman raised Christian"  I stood on the street in Montreal staring at a rundown tenement  building where I was supposed to stay overnight and then face  the abortionist, alone, the next day. I think the hardest thing  I have ever done in my life was to leave my friends behind and  walk up those stairs and ring that doorbell. But I was determined  not to have an unwanted child.  The door opened, and to my very great relief I entered a beautiful living room...I was given a really delightful little girl's  room with a canopy bed, decorated in pink, and with lots of  stuffed animals and beautiful toys all round the room. Everyone  was very friendly to me. I tried to ask questions about the  abortion but no one seemed able to answer my questions.  The next day I woke up, and sure enough, there was a nurse and  a doctor. The whole procedure took about five minutes. The  doctor wouldn't even look at me. The procedure was painless, and  I was surprised—I thought abortion was supposed to be painful.  And I thought it was over. I honestly thought, in my ignorance,  that it was over....  So when my friends came back, we went out and celebrated a bit,  got back on the train to Toronto. On the way back I went into  labour. By the time I got home and was in my own bed, I was in  absolute agony. This lasted a week. I just lay there hemorrhaging  heavily, wishing I was dead or unconscious.  Janet, tribunal witness  My GP came and told me that the physical discomfort I'd experienced was nothing compared to the horror that he had experienced three days past.  Ele:  tribunal witness  The anti-abortionists would have us put up unwanted children  for adoption. I don't give away my children. I don't produce  children for others, as a commodity, like butter or furniture.  For many years pregnant women were not allowed to keep their  jobs. How would I have supported my small family? I could have i  gone on welfare. Why should I? I like being self-sufficient.  Susan, tribunal witness  I am not for abortion. I don't know any woman who really is.  But I am for choice. I am thankful to the women in the past  who fought hard to ensure that I had that choice. I am thankful  to all the women now—including myself—who fight so that our  choices will be increased.  Woman raised as a Christian  legal in Canada. Now the law,  which has been amended,  states that a therapeutic  abortion may be obtained  only after approval by a  committee of three doctors.  The doctors must certify  in writing that continuation of the pregnancy would  endanger the woman's life  or health.  CCCA states that 50 percent  of Canadian women do not  have access to a hospital  with an abortion committee,  and that committees may not  take into account the woman's  economic or emotional situation.  The tribunal program included three sections of testimony interspersed with a song,  a fundraising appeal, and  stories of the 1970 Abortion  Caravan, a protest which ended with women chaining themselves to the railings of  Parliament to protest anti-  abortion laws.  Women testified of the emotional and physical anguish the law  has inflicted on them. The  audience heard of failed contraceptives, non-existent sex  education, long waits for abortion committee decisions, inhumane hospital staff and  lectures from doctors. Home-  induced abortions and scraping together money for  "backstreet butchers" were  described.  After the testimonies and  closing remarks from the  judges, a verdict was  reached. The audience stood  to condemn the law and express  support for the pro-choice  movement.  Ann Thompson, spokesperson  for CCCA, explained that the  trial format, with its' predetermined verdict, was a  rallying of pro-choice supporters rather than a debate  of this highly controversial  Tribunal judges, Thompson said,  had been chosen to give authority to the proceedings. They  included Ingrid Pacey, a  psychiatrist and member of  the Feminist Counselling  Association of B.C.; Lauris  Speaker at tribunal.  National Women's Liberal  Commission; Lorna Zaback of  Vancouver Women's Health  Collective; Ken Wotherspoon,  United Church minister; Art  Kube of the B.C. Federation  of Labour; and Grace Maclnnis,  former NDP MP.  In the three minutes given  judges for closing remarks,  Art Kube expressed his concern that "society provide  services and resources necessary so that women can have  the freedom of choice." Others  urged young people to get  active in fighting the well-  organized anti-choice movement.  Grace Maclnnis sent her  voice ringing through the  hall as she demanded we "get  abortion laws out of the Criminal Code."  Two women did not stand to  condemn the abortion law.  Wendy and Sharlot, both  Christians, came expecting a  debate but remained to hear  the testimony. Both said  they had had abortions before they became "born again,"  but that now they would die  with their child rather than  terminate a pregnancy.  When asked if this should be  the law for all women, Wendy  admitted, "I'd be for  choice if women were shown -  both sides, if they were  educated about their choices."  Wendy was surprised at some  of the witnesses' emotional  testimony: "They were so  angry."  But Sharlot recalled, "I  remember being angry. I  understand what they're  going through, but I can't  condone it. I don't want to  Women at "speak out for choice." ^No Name Column j  by Nora Randall  I couldn't think of a name for this  column or what I wanted to focus on,  but I could think of lots of things  I wanted to talk about.  So I went  ahead and wrote the first column and  I have ideas for the second and third.  I thought I'd just do it and maybe  after we've seen a few,  somebody will  figure out a name and let me know.  I used to live next door to a woman in  her early sixties. After I'd known her  for six years she admitted to me that  she was on welfare. We were getting  evicted and I was trying to help her  plan, so I asked her about her money.  You'd think by the way she looked that  she was telling me that she got her  money by rolling cripples in the lane  on cheque day. She's one of many  reasons that I fly into a rage when I  see things like the Jan. 3, 1985, Sun  headline: "MHR Fraud Crackdown Vowed."  I would like to say to all those who  have found a way to work for money  under the table while on welfare—  good for you.' I don't know where you.  find the time or energy. Also, you  must be a wildly resourceful and  creative person to have figured out  your way around the umpteen million  petty regulations and people they put  in your way. Our welfare system is  designed like one of those humane  mouse traps. When the mouse goes in  to eat the cheese, the door closes  behind her and she can't get out—  alive but trapped.  Grace McCarthy is quoted in the Sun  as saying, "There is need and there  is greed—doing under-the-table deals."  If I didn't know better, I'd suspect  that a welfare recipient was trying  to move into Grade's Shaughnessy  neighbourhood. B.C. welfare recipients  have been left so far out in the  desert of need that it will probably  take them generations to break even.  Consider some of these figures that  Gus Long, a Lower Mainland anti-  poverty advocate, has put together.  A single person with no dependents on  welfare in Vancouver receives 50.4 to  52.6 percent of a poverty-level income. That's counting maximum allowable  earnings in the first year and medical  premium payments. A single mom with  two kids on welfare makes only 85 percent  of the poverty level. We are a long way  from greed here, and pretty close to  disgrace (pardon the pun).  Let's play with these figures a little  bit and see if we can make a living.  A single person with no dependents  makes $4,658.60 a year in B.C. That  means that in order just to hit the  poverty level—we're not talking easy  street, just upper poverty—she would  have to do over $4,000 worth of deals  in a year.  Then Grace has the audacity to suggest  that if welfare fraud -was cut back  maybe the ministry could give more  money. (Again this is according to  the Sun.)   She gives the impression  that her ministry is being taken to  the cleaners by a bunch of unscrupulous people operating out of the  Bayshore.  What's really happening? Gus Long went  to the library and looked in the  Annual Reports of the Ministry of  Human Resources. In 1983/84 there were  146,021 welfare cases. Of these, 8,517  were investigated for fraud. Of these,  1,763 cases were terminated because  of the investigation, which probably  means they were cases of actual fraud.  They constitute 1.21 percent of all wel-  Kinesis February 1986   9  fare cases. And in this whooping 1 percent we still don't know how many of  these people were just desperately trying I  to make a living and how many were trying  to break the bank.  So why is Gracie banging the old  welfare fraud drum on the front page  of the Sunt  Two reasons suggest themselves to me. One is that she is  creating an unfavorable environment  (as if it weren't already unfavorable  enough) for welfare recipients so that'  when she announces her job training  program (for which jobs, I wonder)  recipients can be pressured into  working for nothing. My most bizarre  fantasy is that the Socreds will force  welfare recipients to volunteer at  Expo. Of course it will be a "deal"  because they'll get in for free.  More likely it's just that the poor  are such convenient and safe scapegoats for hard times. I mean, no welfare recipient is going to go up to  Grace at a cocktail party and rake her  over the coals for her attitudes in  front of her friends. Nobody probably  passed out or threw up on her doorstep  in Shaughnessy either. The Bible may  say the poor are always with us, but  at least we can be kept in another  section of town.  Also, it is very hard to fight back  when you are poor. I noticed in my own  life that the times when I have really  been down to the pennies, I become  scrupulously honest and painfully  aware of having to ask people for  things or having people give them to  me. I suspect this is true for a lot  of welfare recipients, because the few  I've talked to are much more adamant  that they don't do fraud than that  the welfare system is' a disgrace. The  times I've had to decide between a cup  of coffee or a ride on the bus, I've  felt bad. It's hard to fight when you  feel lower than slug slime. That's  why I admire the spirit and courage of  people on welfare who are making their  living. Some may squeak by under the  wire; some may freelance. Good for you.  mm  §§§1  Who pays, who goes?

It appears that the latest  commodity on the international tourism market is the misery of Indian women. We had  heard of "sex tours" to  Thailand and the Philippines,  where men from western countries go to buy the bodies  of women who need the money now.  Women from the U.S. propose  to come to India and have ran  exciting holiday feasting on  the misery of Indian women.  We were horrified to receive  a letter dated January 30,  1984, from Odyssey Tours,  a travel agency in the U.S.,  announcing that it had arranged a tour called "Status  of Women in India and Nepal."  It will bring a group of 25  to 30 women from the U.S. on  "a tour to investigate the  status of women in India and  Nepal." This "investigation"  is to take place between  February 24 and March 16,  and the glossy brochure that  accompanies the letter bears  the logo of our national  airline, Air India.  Let us look at the brochure.  It promises "breathtaking  sights of natural and human  wonders" and goes on to  outline them: "In Delhi,  we meet a btoad spectrum  of Indian women, from those  in top government posts  to those who clean and  repair streets for a living. We have scheduled a  meeting with the Prime  Minister of India. We will  combine visits to Indian  homes with sightseeing of  ancient forts, mosques and  monuments."  After putting our homes on  the sightseeing circuit,  the tour proceeds to do  the same with the most  private emotions of joy  and grief: "At Ahmedabad,  arrangements have been made  to observe various women's  rituals and functions around  birth, marriage and death."  The brochure goes on to  promise further delights:  "You will meet child brides,  teenage widows and learn  about the dowry system.  We will be guests of a  local women's organization  as they show us the many  lives of Gujarati women."  This impressive two-day  learning process in Ahmedabad will be followed by a  visit to Bombay, where  another exotic ritual, the  celebration of March 8,  International Women's Day,  by women's organizations  is to be observed while  staying at a local five-star  hotel.  In Nepal, too, the tourists will pay a visit to  Kumari Chowk, where the  "living goddess" is installed. "This divinely  chosen child is worshipped  and paid tribute to until  puberty, when another  girl of the Sakya clan  is chosen to replace her."  Crammed into this trip are  also Ghandi's ashram, Mother  Teresa, "hospitals, clinics,  colleges, schools, temples,  mosques, as well as rich  homes and humble dwellings"  in Calcutta, Jaipur and Agra.  Included also are exciting  treks, relaxation in deluxe  accommodation and fancy meals.  Two whole countries are to be  dissected and laid at the  feet of these holiday-makers  for a mere $3,593.  Of course, that is not how  the organizers describe it.  They call it a "meaningful  cultural exchange." If it is  an "exchange," perhaps they  would like to organize a  tour for Indians on the status of blacks in the U.S.,  or even:-.the status of women  in the U.S. They could conduct this tour through the  slums, ghettos and playboy  clubs, the psychiatric  wards, asylums, old peoples'  homes and divorce courts, and,  of course., through private  bedrooms where women have  been kn.°wn to be battered  and abused.  If they are so concerned  about the status of women,  these tourists would do  better to study such phenomena in their own country  rather than travel so far to  observe women of whom they  have no understanding, whose  language they do not know,  and of whom, consequently, they  can only carry back highly  distorted impressions. India  is a land of complex cultures that are centuries old.  Is it possible to understand  these cultures and the situation of women there in the  space of less than a month?  The real purpose of the trip  is revealed in the adjectives  that are liberally sprinkled  throughout the brochure:  "luxurious," "comfortable,"  "convenient," "enjoyable."  Of course, it is much more  enjoyable and comfortable to  look at misery from a distance than to look at it  in one's own backyard.  These tourists are implicitly being promised a psychological boost of the kind  that is often indulged in  by the wealthy - that of  realizing how "lucky" they  are, how. much "better off"  than those "poor women."  All those who are concerned  about the status of women  in India owe it to themselves to protest against  this proposed tour.  Letters of protest should be  addressed to: Fran' P.

Disabled woman sues parents  by Nancy Pollack  A severely disabled Minnesota  woman is taking her parents  to court because they have  denied visitation rights to  her woman lover and failed to  provide for her rehabilitative needs. Sharon Kowalski,  who became a quadriplegic in  a 1983 car accident and her  lover Karen Thompson have  both filed legal motions  against the Kowalski parents.  Unknown to the Kowalskis,  Sharon and Karen had lived  together as lovers in St.  Cloud, Minnesota for four  years prior to the-ae^dent.  The parents became disturbed  by Karen's involvement with  Sharon's care in the hospital, and responded with  horror when Karen informed  them of the lesbian relationship. Karen filed for  guardianship of Sharon as a  result of their homophobic  response. The Kowalskis  counterfiled and were awarded guardianship with the  provision that Karen be  granted equal access to  visitation and medical staff  consultation.  Since this ruling in July  1983, the Kowalskis have  moved Sharon from the St.  Cloud Hospital to a nursing  home in Hibbing, 300 kilometres  away. Karen's visits have  been blocked by nursing  home staff acting on an or  der from the Kowalskis' fam-  • ily doctor, who accuses  Karen of sexually abusing  Sharon.  Up until July, Karen had  played a significant role  ,  in Sharon's treatment.  The nursing home in Hibbing  lacks the rehabilitative facilities that Sharon requires,  and since treatment is crucial within two years of  the accident, Sharon is  effectively being denied the  chance to recuperate.  Sharon is able to communicate  with a typewriter and has expressed her desire to be in  control of her own affairs  and to continue her relationship with Karen.  The legal motions filed by  the two women seek, among  other things, to remove Mr.  Kowalski as guardian since  he has ignored Sharon's  wishes and her best interests.  It is possible to write to  Sharon Kowalski c/o Leisure  Hills Health Center, Rm* 210,  Hibbing, MN 55746. Also|  funds are urgently needed to  pay for legal expenses.

SPUC harasses  Irish women  by Eunice Brooks  In the Republic of Ireland  there is an amendment to the  Constitution guaranteeing the  right to life of the unborn.  Yet despite opposition from  the Roman Catholic church, the  Irish government last year  passed a law permitting anyone  over the age of 18 to buy  contraceptives. Right to life  groups are still actively harassing anyone who practises  birth control.  One such group, Society for the  Protection of the Unborn  Child (SPUC) has laid charges  against the Well Woman Center  and Openline Counselling for  advising women on how to obtain abortions in foreign  countries. Around 10,000 Irish  women annually go to England  for abortions.  From its start in 1978, the  Well Woman Center in Dublin  has publicly stated its belief in freedom of choice.  They give women a chance to  think through all the available options. There are other  family planning clinics in the  twenty-six counties, but only  Well Woman is completely i^ji|s2%:  pendent. Like the other clini^^fe  however, they are bound by the  1861 Offenses Against the Person Act. They have been directed to counsel on pregnancy  and not abortion referral.  In 1984, 70,502 women and men  used the services, which include  medical clinics for infection  testing, breast exams, rubella  testing, general gynecological  tests, self-help group space,  advice on menstruation and  menopause, plus depression  related to those two. They only  counsel on birth control.  Politically, Well Woman was active in setting up the Anti-  Amendment Campaign—the one  campaign against the amendment  prohibiting abortion—and their  offices were raided by the  Gardai Irish police. They were  charged with selling condoms.  It was true they had. So had  all the other clinics since  the 1979 law approving sale of  condoms to married couples. When  the Irish government passed the  law in 1985 allowing sale of  condoms to 18-year-olds, the  Minister of Health stated that  he would not consent to allow  any clinic to sell condoms if it  also counselled on abortion.  A few days later, Well Woman got  a message from SPUC's lawyers  giving them a week to stop doing  pregnancy counselling and abortion referral, or they would seek  a declaration from the courts  saying that both activities are  illegal under the Constitution.  SPUC is asking for a constitutional action.  A judge was asked to interpret the  new amendment and decide whether  Well Woman is offending it. The  case was heard in December and a  decision is pending. Kinesis February 1986   11  M  <^'X Mexico  ^W / x   Garment  workers organizing  by Tricia Joel  As we sit in Anna Xubillaga's sma  of Mexico City, traffic roars by outsi<  pollution. It winds through streets fil  devastated buildings, and past makesh  tents for the homeless.  Xubillaga is an organizer  for city people who must now rebuild  their lives after the monstrous  earthquake that struck the area on  Sept. 19, 1985, and for the Popular  Committee for Solidarity and Reconstruction, established in response  to the earthquake.  "Well, before the earthquake..."  Anna starts, as she tells the stories  of catastrophic changes in her life  and the life of the community here  in the past four months. How quick- •  ly the images of crumbling buildings  and rescue workers come across our  Demonstration against government inaction.  TV screens and morning papers, and  then are gone, as if it has all been  taken care of: someone is dealing  with the disaster—another project  for aid.  "I never realized how serious it was  that morning, not until I actually  went outside and headed downtown.  40,000 people died, and the government has still not recognized numbers above 8,000; 200,000 homeless,  two major hospitals in ruins, and so  many schools collapsed that 200,000  children still have nowhere to go.  "When the initial shock wore off and  we realized how serious the situation  was, we began to organize into brigades. We were just regular Mexican  people—not experts, not official  organizations from churches or  unions or political groups, just  people; one million of us, working  all over the city while the government did nothing except play messages over the radio and TV every  three minutes saying, 'Stay in your  homes. Stay calm; everything is under  control.'  "We kept going night and day, often  with our bare hands, removing rubble,  helping family members who recog-  I apartment in the heat  le amid the fumes and  ed with rubble from  ift Red Cross  nized the curtains or furniture and  could help us move more quickly to  where someone might be. Some of the  workers organized food for everyone;  others set up phone services where  lines were still functioning.  "The solidarity of the Mexican people,  both rich and poor, was something we  won't be able to forget for many,  many years. There was some help  from international rescue teams, but  many teams went directly to the  government for placement and were  frustrated by the lack of organization."  "You mention the government, Anna.  What did they do during this time?"  Well, they told us that their emergency plan was in effect, but the  only result we could see was that  soldiers and police began to cordon  off fallen buildings, even when we  knew people were still alive inside.  "In some instances we just pushed  past them and only afterwards realized, with terror, that we'd disobeyed a soldier with a rifle  pointed at us. Many lives were lost  because they refused to let people  through.  "As the situation unfolded the corruption and negligence of the government  was revealed. Many of the buildings  that had collapsed, including the  hospitals, were government-owned,  built and maintained, and as they fell  apart it was clear they had not been .  built to required standards. Permits  had been given for faulty construction  and the fraud of architects, inspectors and engineers was laid bare.  People had bought homes in government  housing projects that were advertised  as the safest in Mexico, and they  , were now lying buried under mountains  of rubble.  Destroyed building in the neighbourhood  of the garment  And there's more still. As rescue  attempts continued, clandestine  prisons were found in government  offices, with the bodies of disappeared  persons showing signs of torture. What  we had known for years, and the government had denied, was now a verifiable  reality."  "What happened to the people affected  by all this loss of friends, family,  homes and jobs?"  "The homeless slept in the streets  right from the first night in tents  made of plastic and cardboard, afraid  if they moved to government shelters  on the outskirts of town they'd never  get to live again in the communities  where many had spent all their lives.  They organized communal kitchens and  two huge marches of people to pressure  the President for action.  "You might have heard of the popular  committee of the Damnificados  (the  damaged), organized with representatives of all the camps across the  city. They're still fighting for  money to build their own co-ops.  'Ironically, one of the major outcomes  of the devastation wreaked by the  earthquake was the birth of a powerful women's union: the Sindicato  National de las Costureras (the garment workers). The enormity of their  exploitation had been known by the  government and labour leaders for  decades, but (they) had been in collusion  with the factory owners.  "I'll take you to meet Evangelina  Corona, their general secretary."  Evangelina Corona is a small woman in  her fifties who has a very soft, young  Mexico continued next page 12   Kinesis February 1986  INTERNATIONAL  Mexico from previor 4 page  face and gentle smile. As she walks  over to greet us in her makeshift lean-  to camp in San Antonio Abad—it's filled  with sacks of rice and beans, boxes of  oil, and pinatas hanging from the roof—  you can tell she's still not used to  being the secretary of a militant  union, after 30 years of sitting behind  a sewing machine. She stops to find  garlic for workmen cooking eggs and  at the same time deals with a multitude of people wanting urgently to talk  to her.  As we sip heavily sugared, strong black  coffee, Evangelina talks about the  work situation she's endured for so  many years.  "I've worked in this one factory for  years now. Most of the women are single  mothers, and we work 9 to 10 hours a  day with less pay than the official  minimum wage (equivalent to $25 Canadian a week). Some companeras were in  shops where they were paid piecework,  which means the owner can keep people  on the worksite even if there's no  work—then you only make $10 a week.  Really, to make a decent living a woman needs to take work home with her  after 6:30 at night. You can't come  late or they won't let you in.  "But the worst part is that over half  the women have not been given social  security benefits, which means health  care services, etc. The law says  that after one month you're entitled  to benefits, but the owners keep on  making empty promises year after  year and simply bribe government  .officials to keep the sweatshops  clandestine so they don't pay taxes  and benefits. Sexual favours in return for benefits or better work is  a constant, and even though "there's  been a government-controlled clothing industry union, most women  never heard of it, and it certainly  never spoke up for us."  Evangelina pauses to deal with a  line of people wanting to greet her  with the double handshake of solidarity and with urgent problems to solve.  Meanwhile, bags of basic food items  are handed out through the window to  a line of costureras  (garment work  ers) and their children, who are all  checked off in a book by their worksites.  "When the tremor happened at 7:19 on  the 19th," she continued, "many women  were already at work. Believe it or  not, some owners locked the doors  when the quake started to stop women  from leaving their machines. Those  companeras never escaped from beneath  the heavy machinery and huge rolls of  fabric. 1,600 women were lost.  "During the next few hours and days,  while many workers were still trapped  in the rubble, owners got government  permission—or paid soldiers huge  amounts of money—to pull out their  strong boxes, machinery and cloth.  In some places we stopped them when  we realized that this meant they  could start up somewhere else and  claim there had never been a company  there, and so pay no back wages,  funeral expenses or compensation.  "Some owners were so greedy, they  obliged women to go- back to work in  damaged buildings where the stairways had collapsed. In adjacent  buildings bodies were still not  recovered. This is how we are treated.  As late as September 27, eight days  after the quake, one worker was found  alive.  "So there we are, 40,000 of us, costureras,   in the streets outside our  sweatshops, and we cried together,  shared our stories together and the  consciousness of many of us was  awakened for the first time. We  set up camps like this one to feed  people and organize how we could  survive without any income, and  then to start to demand our legal  rights. By October 18, the women of  35 shops marched to the President's  palace to demand justice and ask  for a union to represent us.  "Recognition of unions, not run by  government, is not an easy thing.  It's done by a junta  that represents  owners and bureaucrats. Some groups  have tried for years and been refused  flat. Although it was definitely not  out of the goodness of their hearts,  they gave us certification within  48 hours and the Sindicato National  de Costureras was born. Certifying us  was a calculated political move to  silence the popular support we had  once our exploitation became public.  Of course we were happy, and as  you can imagine it gave us some power.  "We know this, because since certification, they won't let us bargain  collectively and want each site to  have their own agreement. Of course,  this makes our job ridiculous: here  we are with a union but with no jobs  since the earthquake, devastated  worksites, no owners to negotiate  with and no guaranteed protection  for all of us. The fact that there are  hundreds of sweatshops with 40 to 50  workers in each makes organizing very  difficult.  'In a couple of the sites where women  "have been joining us, the official  unions began offering workers raises  to stop them; in others women have  been fired for trying to negotiate  agreements, with little chance of  being reinstated. Of course, this  deeply affects the women because they're  not used to fighting for power.  "They have been exploited so long,  they have little self-worth and don't  know how to run organizations. Fear  of losing work and not being able to  support their children: it's a big  thing for us women."  She pauses, looks at me and says, "So  you can see we're fighting on many  fronts. Right now the union has three  sections: the union organizing groups,  encouraging women to become members;  the legal area; and the whole issue  of industrial health and working conditions. What I would like you to tell  people when you go back home is that  we are fighting for what is ours by  law and for justice—nothing else. Ask  people to send telegrams to Miguel de  la Madrid, (Mexico's President) saying  that you know that the problems of the  costureras  have not been resolved."

V6B 2P4 Kinesis February 1986   13  by Sharon Hounsell  Racism, language, immigration policies  and cultural traditions complicate the  problem of wife assault within Vancouver'!  Chinese-Canadian community.  Stella Ng's exploratory study, Violence  Against Women in the Chinese-Canadian  Family,  addresses these factors and  sheds light on an area largely untouched by Canadian feminists.  Ng's study researches community awareness of wife abuse and attempts to  uncover community needs. It includes  interviews with survivors of wife  abuse and with resource people from  local, legal, social and health services.  Violence Against Women in the Chinese-  Canadian Family  notes that despite  improvements to the status of women  in China, many historically based Confucian views on women's roles and  the family remain widely held in  China and by Chinese-Canadians..  According the Ng, "The structure of  many East Asian cultures is dominated by Confusian thought"—a 2,500-  year-old philosophy with a hierarchical worldview based on age, sex, class  and education. Confucian principles  place a strong emphasis on specific  roles and proper relationships, and  revere the family as society's basic  unit. For immigrants who left China  during the revolution or in the 1950s  and 1960s, and for families migrating  from rural areas, this influence is  particularly strong.  The study points out that Canada's  early immigration policies have  played a significant, if indirect,  role in this dynamic. Mothers-in-  law Ng says, may be most hostile  where mother and son bonding has  been most intense. Under Canada's  former immigration policy, Chinese  men immigrating to this country  were not permitted to bring their  families. Left behind in China,  mothers and sons grew closer and  more interdependent. Ng says  mother-in-law hostility may be  more pronounced in these instances.  The impact of Canada's immigration  policies is not limited to these  situations. An even greater problem is that until the mid 1950s,  few women of Chinese descent could  come to Canada independently.  Those who did migrate came, most  often, under the sponsorship of  their husbands or their husband's  family.  Canada's immigration policies continue to make it difficult for  people to immigrate as independents  and so create barriers for Asian  women wishing to leave their countries . For these women a Canadian  passport is a passport to increased  educational and occupational opportunities. Marriage is often the  only means of obtaining one.  Many Asian men experience pressure  from their families to marry women  Some Asian men travel to Southeast Asia  to 'Hook for a wife ". In other cases men  seek, "mail order brides".  In Confucian tradition "women hold a  low status and are perceived as the  property of their fathers and husbands." A husband's will to dominate  is considered appropriate and is  condoned. The survivors Ng interviewed  see their husband's violence as an  attempt to exert control, which stems  from feelings of insecurity.  According to the study, in addition to  a woman's low status the extended  family often plays a substantial role  in aggravating a battering situation.  In traditional Chinese extended families a son's first loyalty continues to  be to his parents; his second is "to  his own family. A woman leaves her  family to live "in obedience" to her  husband's family. Within this "new"  family the son's wife has the lowest  status. She is often regarded as an  outsider and perhaps treated as a  servant.  Ng says a wife's refusal "to accept  this role may lead to battering, as  paternal family members may encourage  the man to demonstrate his prowess  by physically punishing her."  As well, since sons are expected to  obey their parents, the mother-in-  law has a higher status than her  daughter-in-law and therefore has—  perhaps for the first time in her  life—authority within the family.  The mother-in-law has most likely  lived her life in a subservient  role to the father and husband; significantly, male family members are  likely to have been the most influential role models for her use of  authority.  Survivors interviewed comment  that frequently their mother-in-law  "is particularly hostile...and...  directly or indirectly caused the  abuse to occur."  of Asian descent. Ng's study points  out that some Asian men believe  Chinese-Canadian and Caucasian  women discriminate against them,  and that many Asian men find  Canadian women "too liberated."  "The stereotypes of Asian women as  being sexy yet submissive, passionate yet obedient, portrayed in the  Chinese-language and mainstream '  media may have brainwashed Asian  males into thinking of marrying  Chinese women from overseas."  Some Asian men travel to Southeast  Asia to "look for a wife." In other  cases men seek "mail-order brides":  this is sometimes arranged by families and sometimes by correspondence .  Men who procure mail-order brides  are likely to find that the women  are not the submissive models they  sought. They may in fact be "too  independent" or "too intellectual,"  and beatings may follow.  Asian families may also encourage  or arrange marriages for their  daughter with the hopes of enhancing chances of migrating to.  Canada. A lawyer Ng interviewed  found that in her caseload approximately 50 percent of battered  women were mail-order brides  married to Chinese-Canadian men.  Community resource people interviewed indicated that most of the  battered women who have approached  helping agencies are family-sponsored immigrants. These women find  themselves in a vulnerable position:  "Because of the sponsored-immigrant  status of many of the women, many  batterers often threaten to deport  them if the women ever leave the  abusive relationships."  Violence  Against  Women  in the  Chinese  Canadian  Family  Although quantitative studies are  not obtainable, statistics from  SUCCESS (United Chinese Community  Enrichment Services Society) indicate that battering incidents are as  common in families who have been in  Canada for 10 years as they are in newly immigrated families. However,  recent immigrants may be more reluctant  to use community services because seeking outside assistance is unacceptable  within their culture. Hence, such  statistics may not accurately reflect  the reality.  Canada's immigration policies have  often been found to rest on racist  foundations. Ng's study also looks  at how racism generally compounds the  problem of wife battering for Chinese  people in Canada.  Ng notes that "the difficulty of dealing with racism has directly and indirectly led minority communities to  belittle the seriousness of within-  community sexism in general and of  violence against women in particular."  According to Ng, racism increases  Chinese-Canadians continued on page 22  I 14   Kinesis February 1986  WELFARE  Family Support Program makes poor pay  by AlexMaas  Early in 1985, at a time of severe  restraint and reductions in social  services, the Ministry of Human Resources introduced a new social  service. The Family Support Program (FSP)  patterned after a similar and successful program of the New Democratic  government of Manitoba, provides a  "maintenance and enforcement service"  to single parents receiving income  assistance.  In effect MHR, with legal assistance  from the Attorney General, has set up  an agency, called the Family Support  Unit, which obtains and/or enforces  all court orders for child support  payments to single parents on welfare.  The program monitors and enforces  court orders through a computer-assisted central registry which keeps track  of each monthly payment as it arrives.  If the cheque does not arrive, the  errant ex-spouse gets a phone call or  letter to pay up.  Bennett's Socreds have made a few  custom-tailored changes to the Manitoba  NDP version. Most notably this service  is available only to single parents on  welfare in Vancouver. In Manitoba the  service is available province-wide to  the general public. According to MHR,  if the initial pilot project here goes  well, the program may be expanded to  include the general public throughout  the province.  The program begins when a single parent  applies for income assistance. The  intake worker immediately determines  the welfare applicant's situation regarding maintenance and explains the  program. If regular maintanance payments  are not already established the applicant has three options. She can choose  to enrol in the family support program.  She can choose to make an independent  maintenance claim, or she can attempt  to convince the intake worker that  she has good reasons for not pursuing  support.  If a welfare applicant is undecided  about which option she prefers, she  is contacted by the Family Support  Unit (FSU) after she has applied  for income assistance. They explain  the options to her again. A maintenance Decision/Referral Form is  completed for every applicant covered by the Family Support Program.  Participation in the Family Support  Program is supposed to be voluntary.  However, under Regulation 3(9) of  the GAIN Act, a person is eligible  for income assistance only if she  makes "reasonable efforts" to  seek out every source of income  available to her. Since the program's  inception this regulation is interpreted as a requirement that single  parents pursue maintenance payments  as a matter of course. (I was repeatedly referred to this regulation  in discussing the mechanics of the  program with FSU administrators.)  Under certain limited circumstances a decision can be made not to  pursue support. Such circumstances,  listed in the FSP policy manual,  include cases when the spouse is  dead and without an estate, in jail  and without assets, on welfare or  disabled.  If a single mother is apprehensive .  that court action may mean retaliation by a violent ex-husband, she  must convince the MHR that this is  the case. MHR workers must convince  MHR that this is the case. MHR  workers must confirm a history of  family violence through outside  sources such as the police, a doctor,  or transition house workers before  making a recommendation of no-pursuit.  A no-pursuit recommendation must be  approved by the district supervisor,  who has the final decision about  eligibility for income assistance.  If the woman resists due to concern  about causing further family uproar  or incurring an attitude of non-cooperation with regard to other  issues, such as custody, or if MHR  feels that claims of family violence  are not substantiated, a single  mother may be forced to go to court  anyway in order to get welfare.  The Vancouver  Legal Services  office is presently representing a  single mother who has refused to  pursue maintenance and has been refused benefits as a result.  Heather Cortner's case is a good example of a situation where a single  mother feels that pursuit would be  unreasonable and MHR is insisting  that she proceed. MHR is demanding  that she pursue her ex-husband, from  whom she has been separated for almost  six years, for spousal support (i.e.,  support for herself) and also that she  pursue a second man, the father of her  third child, for child support, despite  the fact that he has been on income  assistance for a number of years. Although the father will not be required  to make payments while he collects welfare, MHR wants the order in the event  that he finds employment in the future.  Ms. Carter is appealing both decisions  to a welfare tribunal.  The Family Support Program raises issues  about the state's authority over the  individual and the individual's  right to confidential legal representation. When questioned about a possible  conflict of interest, lawyers working  for the program clearly stated that  the applicant, not the state, is their  client. They insist that the normal lawyer/|  client relationship of confidentiality  exists.  Georgia Williams, administrative counsel  for the program, said all information  would remain priviliged. She did acknowledge, however, that a certain amount  of information-sharing was done with  the Family Support Unit regarding the  progress of the case.  For women who choose to pursue maintenance independently, however, the situation is not as clear. Family Court  Counsellors, who assist people seeking  maintenance awards, are also assigned  to the Family Support Unit and are not  bound by the same client/solicitor  privilege. Any information they receive  which indicates that the law (for example, the GAIN Act) was broken must be  reported to MHR. Family court counsel- ,  lors may also be asked to testify against  welfare clients.  The economics of the MHR program also  bear some examination. There are undoubtedly a number of single parents on  income assistance who are one hundred  dollars a month richer because of this  program. There are also, however, men  and women (working women can be ordered  to make support payments to fathers on  welfare with dependent children) with  incomes below the poverty line who are  making payments of up to 30 percent of their  income directly to the state.  In some cases, since support payments  are treated as income and may be deducted  from welfare cheques, the dependent  spouse does not see any of the support  money. A maintenance exemption of $100  monthly (maximum) is applied, and the remainder the woman receives is deducted  from her welfare cheque. Where a single  mother has other income, for instance  from a part-time job, she may be ineligible to receive any of her support payment.  Whether a woman goes through the FSU  or proceeds independently, she is "encouraged" to have her payments monitored  by the FSU. MHR believes it is not in  the woman's best interest to receive  payments directly. Aside from all the  games ex-husbands play, if money goes  directly to the woman it makes it difficult for MHR to keep track of payments  and the appropriate deductions from  women's welfare cheques.  The names of defaulting spouses are  sent to the Family Support Unit by  the court. They are contacted and  payment is requested. Where payments  are not forthcoming, further legal  action such as garnishment of wages,  etc., can be automatically started.  If money goes directly to the woman  it makes it difficult for MHR to keep  track of payments and the  appropriate deductions from the  welfare cheque.  The other question here is whether men  really pay even after an order has been  made. Family Court Counsellors in Vancouver estimate that the average case is that  of a man who has been separated from his  children and their mother for five or six  years and has never paid support. He makes  one or two payments when ordered to do so  and ten stops. He makes another couple of  payments after he is hauled into court,  and then stops again.  Court costs are high, and dragging errant  ex-spouses through the court system, even  when it pays, is not cheap. Whether it  pays and who it pays are questions we won't  have the answers to until the Ministry  of Human Resources releases the findings  of its scheduled assessment of the program  in the upcoming months.  This program could take on a new usefulness when and if it is made available to  single mothers not dependent on the welfare  system. Women who will make a real choice  about whether to pursue maintenance, and  they will be able to use the whole amount  of any support payments they win. In its present form the Family Support Program is  another example of the Socreds' policy of  making the poor pay through privatization of  social services. The program attempts to  shift the burden of responsibility for an  individual mother and children off the state  and back onto the family, specifically onto  one man.  In recent telephone interview, a program administrator enthusiastically told the story  of a woman without dependent children who  had been assisted in obtaining spousal  support payments high enough that she  had been able to leave the welfare rolls  altogether. This is stuff that a welfare administrator's dreams are made of. Known throughout the nuthouse for breaking windows  and escaping across roofs.  Kinesis February 1986   15  Following, and on the centrespread,  are excerpts from Still Sane,   a book  based on the sculpture series created  by Persimmon Blackbridge and Sheila  Gilhooly. Still Sane  was published  by Vancouver's Press Gang publishers  in December of last year and is  available in bookstores across  Canada.  jp^frHwpH"  The idea to do Still Sane  began back  in 1981. I had just finished a  sculpture series called Circus,  which  was all action and colour and fun—  sculptures of women riding on  leopards and jumping through hoops  of fire and that kind of thing. So  then I thought, "Okay, I've had my  fun, now it's time to do some serious political artwork."  I started in and made some really bad  sculptures. This went on for several  months and I was getting kind of  frantic. All these insidious thoughts  kept creeping into my head, like maybe it's true that all political art is  lousy art and it's shallow and flimsy  and propaganda—which are ideas that  are amazingly common even in today's  (post) modern world.  £"hei*)d  Art has always bored and intimidated  me—and artists too. Art didn't seem  to be about me or for me and, as for  artists, I didn't understand either  their work or their explanations of  it. Art seemed like something only a  few could get and I wasn't one of  those few. So I was bored by it all and  felt inadequate and stupid about my  boredom.  Persimmon is an artist whose work I  reallv liked and admired lone before  meeting her, because it was about big  and strong women who could be me. With  her unartistic-like sharing of who can  be an artist, she had started demystifying art and artists for me before  we worked on Still Sane.  pensirnmov*  The first plaster i  mold we made, Sheila  almost fainted in the middle of it. We  had spent about an hour, her and me and  a mirror, trying to work out a pose that  looked and felt all tense and held-in  and ground-down. When we finally got  it, it looked just right, but we neglec  ted to think about how it would feel to  maintain that rigid tension without  moving for forty-five minutes.  We covered her with vaseline (to keep  the plaster from sticking) and she  cranked herself into this pose and I  started putting plaster-soaked gauze  (like they use to splint broken arms)  all over her, and it was wet and cold  and drippy. As the plaster started to  set, it got hot and prickly. I was almost to her shoulders when she started  swaying a little bit and then she turned  green and her knees collapsed and we  managed to pull the mold off just before she hit the floor.  We salvaged that mold and finished it  when she recovered, but the second  pose we did was even worse. It was  more actively agonized-looking.  We achieved realistic effects by having  her lie with her back arched up over a  bunch of pillows—a position that quickly became so painful that it was easy  for her to keep a convincing facial  expression.  But the worst part was that Sheila had  this brilliant notion that we could  save money by using straight plaster  instead of the plaster/gauze bandages.  We couldn't find casting plaster in  lots over five pounds (and we were  looking for fifty pounds) so finally  we got industrial plaster of Paris.  There she was, all contorted with straws  up her nose and I was pouring the  plaster over her, and it was grey instead of white and the texture wasn't  what I was used "to but, oh, well,  plaster is plaster, right? As it hardened it got really hot, burning hot,  and Sheila (who was covered face to  thighs with plaster) somehow conveyed  to me that she had to get out.  I was getting panicky, but since I  wasn't the one covered with thirty  pounds of solid, unmoving (and hot)  plaster, I acted super calm. "It's  okay, Sheila, just wiggle a little  more, we'll have it right off." Sheila  recognized by me cool, confident tone  of voice that I didn't have the slightest idea what I was doing. Finally we  managed to crack the mold into pieces  which we pulled off along with goodly  portions of hair. After that we stuck  to the bandages.  My biggest fear in going public with  the show was that I would be treated  like a mental patient. Not that I would  be locked ,up again exactly, though in  my dreams even that seemed easily  possible. I felt isolated and unique in  a most unpleasant way in a community  that had allowed me to belong, to like  myself, and to be strong and never to  need another psychiatrist or think  that I wanted one. I was worried  that when people saw the figures/story they  would respond with fear at the worst,  or with an isolating sympathy at the  best. My mental hospital experiences  were not a totally secret thing. I  had told lots of women over the years,  but never till I'd known them for a while.  Knowing a thing like that affects people's  perception of how okay you are. If you  use a normal/pathological model to look  at most people you can confirm your  worst suspicions of weirdness. I didn't  know any other ex^mental patients at  all, let alone any that belonged to  the same world as me—or so I thought.  At the opening of the show lots of women  told me they'd been there too, or their  mothers or sisters had. Some of them I  didn't know and some I did—women I'd  known for years without knowing that.  There we all were swapping stories and  sometimes we were angry and sometimes  sad but we all knew we had something to  flaunt. When you flaunt something nobody  can use it against you.  pere/mmon  The project grew, and showing it became  more of a graspable reality, the fact  that her experiences were going to be  up on the wall, while mine remained private, made this difference between us. I  hated it. We already felt isolated in the  world and being isolated from each  other on top of it was the pits.  All our strong connections didn't go  away, but there was this rift and it  was real. Critics wrote about my "powerful" artwork and her "disintegrating"  personality, and that was supposed to  be a positive review. So we'd rant and  rave about how stupid it all was and  try to support each other in our different roles, but it was rough.  Whenever I did any kind of public talk  or interview about the show, I'd make  myself talk about "flipping out" and  cutting up my arms and growing up  weird, just so Sheila wouldn't be out  there totally on her own. I'd get all  shaky and think, "they're going to  think I'm really crazy—even in  the lesbian feminist community they  don't like you to get too  wild," or  ^They'll think I'm really weird and  self-indulgent to talk about this  stuff in public," or "It's all in the  past anyway—I haven't cut myself  in a year and a half"—which was a  watered-down version of what Sheila  felt all the time  back then.

She lied about  where she was going because she knew  she wouldn't get a pass to see the  show. She told me her story. It gives  a glimpse of what it is like for lesbians in mental hospitals" today.  Sumi had been diagnosed as manic  depressive and put on lithium. In  the spring of 1984 she started to get  high. She was told to take Haldol with  the: lithium to bring her down. Believing that psychiatric drugs are harmful  she didn't want to take Haldol. Throughout the summer she continued to get high.  She went without eating or sleeping and  was hanging out on the streets. By the  end of August she agreed to go into  hospital at the University of British  Columbia in order to stabilize her  lithium level.  Her doctor, a general practitioner,  couldn't get her a bed there for two  weeks; however, if she just went to  emergency at Vancouver General Hospital she could be transferred to UBC  in two short days. Standard psychiatric  admitting procedure at VGH includes  drugs. Sumi's doctor made a deal with  the hosptial that Sumi would be given  a minimum dose as long as she remained  quiet.  Both Sumi and her lover Les were scared,  but they were also desperate and there  was nowhere else to go. Sumi packed  her things and Les drove her to the  hospital. Sumi signed herself in at  the emergency admitting desk and an  orderly came and took them to the  psych ward. Sumi handed over her admitting slip and she and Les were told  to sit and wait.  A doctor and an attendant, both men,  came and asked Sumi to follow them.  Les was told to stay put. Although  frightened, Sumi went. A woman came  and started to ask Les questions.  Then Sumi started screaming, "Les,  help me."  Les saw her coming out of a room,  but two orderlies pulled her back. Les  ran toward the room. A nurse shouted,  "She can't go in there."  Someone appeared and escorted Les  back to the waiting room.  "You can't see her right now," they  said. "She's very agitated and we have  to give her a shot to calm her down."  "Why can't I go to her?" Les asked.  She was told that she would have to wait  until Sumi was calm.  A woman doctor appeared.  "Please stay here," she said. "I'm  going to talk to May. (May is the  name on Sumi's birth certificate.  Sumi is the name she gave herself.)  Then I'll come and talk to you."  "Are you giving her drugs?" Les asked.  "You promised you wouldn't give her any  drugs, that was a condition."  "We're only giving her two milligrams  of Haldol—a very light dose so she'll  sleep tonight—because if she isn't,  quiet she'll have to be given more  drugs so as not to upset the other  patients."  "You promised and you lied," said  Les. "I'll just take her home. You  can give her a prescription for Haldol and she can take it at home and  wait the two weeks to go to UBC."  "She's too agitated," said the doctor.  "She's psychotic. She'll be better  off here. I'll explain to her that  it's just for two days, then is she's  quiet she can go to UBC."  The doctor went and explained to Sumi  that if she wasn't quiet they would  up her dosage and she wouldn't be  allowed to go to U.B.C. since that  hospital didn't take agitated patients.  Then the doctor returned and told Les  how neat Sumi was and how rare it is  for manics to bring themselves in when  they're getting high.  "So you're her lover," the doctor said.  Les didn't answer.  "Well, she was calling you 'baby.' If  you're that close to her, when you go  in tell her to keep calm."  Then Sumi started screaming and calling  Les again. Les couldn't tell what was  going on and she got really upset.  "What are you doing to her?" she yelled  at the psychiatrist.  "Why are you so hostile?" said the  doctor.  I told my shrink I didn't want to be  cured of being a lesbian. He said that  just proved how sick I was.  He said I needed shock treatment.  Dee dee NiHera is a mad dyke searching for shelter in San Francisco.  Her work has appeared in a number of  mad and feminist publications. To  support her writing she paints houses,  sews clothes, hauls garbage, facilitates workshops and teaches holistic healing.  by Dee dee NiHera  It was the mad movement which encouraged me to develop a political consciousness about therapy and psychiatric assault. It is this community  which supports me and initially helped  me to develop pride as a mad woman and  a survivor of medical violence.  My mad peers never make me feel strange  or embarrassed about my life in a psychiatric cage. They want to hear about my  version of reality and my past experience with mental illness workers. With  madwomen I don't need to wear long  sleeves to hide my scars or close my  mouth to hide my pain.  Madwomen are angry at being labelled  and defined by professional mental  illness workers in particular and by  society in general. We recognize the  existence of multiple realities, ecstasy, pain and confusion. But organizing these aspects of living into  some disease category alienates us  from so-called normals in an unhelpful way. It makes our sisters afraid  of us.  Those not yet labelled censor their  words and actions for fear of fitting  into one of the hundreds of diagnostic  categories. I think that as the farce  of these diagnoses is exposed, as we  share our unspeakable fears with each  other, we will worry less about going  crazy and realize that most of us have  already arrived.  Care is big business, a commodity to be  bought and sold. Those who pay professionals—I refer to these people as  'payers,' a term I find more accurate  than 'clients' or 'patients'—are the  industry's raw material. The economic  survival of mental illness professionals depends on perpetuating this industry in some form.  Part of this perpetuation is giving  payers and prospective payers the impression that university credentials  are connected with knowledge, experience and helpfulness, and that therapy is something more than paid conversation. They would like us to believe  that they alone deserve to control the  market on chatting-for-hire.  I believe that these professionals lie  not only to those paying them but to  themselves and to each other. They  censor studies challenging their expertise and invalidating their accepted treatments, and they refuse to  ,seriously consider criticism from those  paying their wages.  I am not one of the madwomen who finds  working with mental illness professionals towards social change either useful  or empowering. This includes feminist  therapists. I think our priorities  and analyses differ too greatly.  Creating a non-sexist mental illness  business will merely change the sex  of my oppressors. When women shock  doctors feel oppressed by their male  counterparts, my solidarity is not  with them but with their victims.  I advocate survivors leaving the professionals and creating peer alternatives rather than participating with  professionals in reforming their system  of support for us. I have worked  with feminist professionals in creating an alternative safe house only to  see it become a mini-professionalized  institution which escorted 'difficult'  women to locked wards.   I have experienced being considered an  'inferior' when attempting to smash  the current system with feminist shrinks.  I have be'en named 'sicko' and 'schizo'  by feminists who disagreed with my  opinions, and I have found myself incarcerated by feminists with degrees,  indoctrinated in patriarchal ignorance.  These are not isolated incidents. I'm  not the only madwoman treated this way  by feminists and by society at large.  Before meeting Sheila and Persimmon I  felt no support from feminists"for my  mad politics. U.S. feminists have failed  to take a stand on forced treatment and  electroshock. Furthermore, since  feminist therapy in the urban U.S.  reached the position of dogma and is  now beyond community criticism, violence  against madwomen and other feminists is  either silenced or considered the  payer's own fault.  Professional women are constantly in  demand by feminist groups to tell madwomen's experiences. We are angry at  this silencing and at these women  making a living from our pain and our  abuse.  While U.S. feminists publish their ideas  on 'how to choose a therapist,' radical  madwomen share alternatives to these unequal relationships. While  these feminists regret  locking their sisters  away in psychiatric cages,  madwomen support each  other in their homes,  sometimes with great difficulty. While madwomen step  out of line and are tortured with psychiatric  electrocution and chemical  and physical assaults, in  feminist circles debates  continue about whether  these problems are personal  or political and whether  electroshock and drugging  are indeed torture or just  •legitimate treatment.  Feminists believe that §  those most affected by **.  psychiatric abuses are _£■  women, people of colour, Jj  poor people, old people, g  lesbians and gay men. Mad "  people realize that psychiatric violence most damages  I told them what he did to me but they  said I was making it up, I was crazy,  that I secretly wanted him and I was  going to get in bad trouble for telling  stories about people who were only  trying to help me. I never told again  even though it happened again. And  again. And again. What I want to  know now is—do you believe me? Do  you?  anyone who directly receives locked  lodgings, drugs, shock, brain surgery  and labels of psychopathology. As a  group, survivors of psychiatry must  deal with daily oppression from non-  mad political activists, the mass  media, the general public-and mental  illness workers.  Those professionals who encourage  psychiatric violence, who need our  pain to survive economically, are  no more our comrades and liberators  in this struggle than men are ^  saviours in the struggle for i  liberation. The most complete understanding of our situation as mad people will  come not from outsiders, but from ourselves .  Mad culture is here to stay. As we organize and encourage each other to come  out we all feel stronger. This encouragement comes from conversations over  the phone or over coffee, through poetry,  graphic art, books, demonstrations,  writing and now sculpture.  Still Sane  gives each of us pride while  teaching the importance of political protest. I see mad culture giving us all  the courage and pride to scream, "No  more!"  Sometimes we just need to do that  to survive.  YOU SAW TH£ m SHOW,WORkTHE BUTTON AMOT'SWrT saW -The VlpeO,  eOO&rfT AKO RfcAD 1ME feOOK?

This discussion between  two women is the first of a two-part  series. Rosalind Kellett interviewed  Jeanette Leitch.  What does the term "free trade" mean?  Free trade is trade in goods and services between countries that is not  hindered by tariff or non-tariff barriers.  A tariff is simply a tax or duty  placed on goods entering a country. A  non-tariff barrier is anything else that  hinders the free flow of goods across  borders—for example, the agricultural  regulations that stop you from taking  certain fruits and vegetables into the  U.S.  Free trade is based on the principle of  comparative advantage and follows naturally  from the free market theory of Adam Smith.  This theory says that benefit to everyone  in total will be maximized if each individual does what she or he does best, and  then people freely trade back and forth  the results of their labour. Ideally,  free trade would include complete mobility  of labour and a common currency unit.  I have a friend who ^W^n a small business  specializing in knitting and marketing  personalized wool sweaters. How will free  trade affect her?  In terms of the tariff barriers, if your  friend imports her wool from the U.S.  and the negotiations remove a tariff from  this wool, then her cost will go down. If  a tariff is removed from the kind of  sweaters she makes, then your friend  could sell her sweaters more cheaply in  the U.S., thus demand would increase and  she would have a larger market available  to her.  But there's a catch. The reciprocal removal of the tariffs on sweaters would  mean that U.S.-made sweaters would be  available more cheaply in Canada. Your  friend would have to price her product  to compete with this lower price of  U.S. sweaters. Without the protection  she gains now from the tariff that raises  the price of the U.S. sweaters in Canada,  she may be faced with the choice of  somehow increasing her productivity" in  order to compete or finding another line  of busii  How would removing the non-tariff barriers affect her?  Non-tariff barriers are much harder to  remove. For instance, quotas can be  negotiated and altered, but standards and  regulations are trickier to change. If  your friend uses raw wool from outside  North America, such as the Andes, then it  •is possible that the U.S. has regulations  concerning the condition of that wool  before it can enter the U.S.,.for example,  may restrict allowable dyes.  Now, Canada may have different regulations.  In that case your friend's product might  not be permitted for sale in the U.S. even  though American-knitted sweaters could  enter Canada. Or it could be the other  way around.  In addition, if your friend has young  children at a subsidized daycare, this  could be an issue in the talks between  the United States and Canada. Does subsidizing the daycare make it easier for  the Canadian manufacturer to get labour?  Axe her costs less because of it? Is  the subsidy unfair to her competitors in  It is difficult for a mouse to  live next door to an elephant.  Some Americans consider certain Canadia  social policies such as Medicare, U.I.C.,  regional development grants, transportation subsidies, etc., as unfair subsidies to Canadian producers—unfair  because the Americans don't get them.  Why did tariff barriers get set up in  the first place?  Originally tariffs were a means of raising revenue just like other taxes. An  example was the duty on tea that sparked  the Boston Tea Party and the beginning  of the American Revolution.  However, for more than a century now  tariffs have been levied as a means of  protecting domestic production. They  effectively raise the price of imported  goods to be comparable (i.e., as expensive  for consumers!) with the same goods produced inside the country. This provides  protection for domestic producers against  low-cost producers outside the country  >i»0  1 .«*«**& **  fern"1  876-2123  Mon. and Wed. 11 am to 5 pm.

It means the domestic  producers can remain less efficient since  they are not forced to compete.  Now "efficiency" can be a tricky concept.  Manufacturers in Canada may be less  efficient not because their machinery and  processes are outmoded, but simply  because of "economies of scale." Because  Canada has only a tenth of the population  of the U.S., the Canadian market is much  smaller. If Canadian manufacturers have  access only to the Canadian market, because of tariff barriers imposed by  other countries, Canadian production runs  are smaller—be it cereal boxes or  automobiles or refrigerators. Each cereal"  box or auto or refrigerator then will  cost more—no matter how modern the plant.  Hence we get the free trade dilemma.  Canadian producers could benefit from  expanding into the larger U.S. market but  then, in exchange, there is the risk of  the domestic market being flooded by  U.S. goods. It is difficult for a "mouse"  to live next door to an "elephant."  How do labour costs affect  "efficiency"?  By comparison with labour productivity in  the U.S., Canadian labour can be seen to be  expensive and "inefficient." That's because labour costs tend to be lower on  average in the U.S. than in Canada, due  to the lower ratio of organized workers  generally and, over the past couple of  years, the weakening of the American  trade unions as they have steadily lost  members and political and economic power.  This is one reason why the Canadian Labour  Congress is strongly opposed to free  trade, fearing this loss in the gains  that unions have made for working people  will spread across the border. Higher  labour costs in Canada reflect better  working conditions and job security. They  also reflect commitment to providing jobs  and community stabilization in more  remote regions which would be uneconomic  without the consideration of such social  benefits. Thus, Canadian labour costs  can be seen to be "efficient" when compared to the rest of the Canadian.market.  How important is the U.S.  to Canada,  as  a trading partner?  Canada is described as having a small  open economy because 30% of her gross  national product is exported. Of these  exports, almost 70% go to the U.S. Canada  is also the largest customer of the  U.S.: about 10% of U.S. exports go to  Canada and account for more than 60%  of Canadian imports. The United States is  described as a large closed economy since it  it exports a far smaller percentage of  its gross national product (GNP). Thus  Canada is more dependent on trade, and the  U.S. is by far Canada's most important  trading partner.  If trade is almost free,  why are Tories  so keen now on free trade?  Some Americans believe that they are already importing too much from Canada, and  not exporting enough—they want to protect more American jobs. It is partly in,  reaction to this growing mood of U.S.  protectionism that Canada wants negotiations that would reduce or maintain trade  barriers rather than having them increase.  Also, many Canadian firms are presently  unwilling to invest in expansion unless  they have some guarantee of access to the  large American market. With such guarantees,  Canadian productivity and efficiency would  probably increase because of the economies  of scale using longer production runs.  But then again, at the same time many  U.S. firms have established "branch  plants" in Canada because of Canadian  tariffs. That's the only way they can "jump"  the tariff barriers now. If those barriers  are removed, some U.S. firms very probably  Already anti-free trade sentiment  is rising in Ontario . . . not  so in BC.  will decide their branch plants no longer  make economic sense, especially if they  are already operating large, efficient  plants inside the U.S. that have surplus  capacity.  In other words, free trade may mean some  Canadian plants can expand—but it also  means some U.S. branch plants will close.  Will Canadian workers, and especially  Canadian women in manufacturing, see more  jobs open up, or more jobs terminated? No  one knows.  Does Canada have free trade arrangements  with other countries?  We don't have complete free trade with  other countries, but Canada is a  signatory of GATT, the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade. This organization  carries out an ongoing set of negotiations  aimed at gradually reducing tariff barriers among the trading nations of the  world.  Also, Canada used to have preferred access  to the United Kingdom markets, along  witliother'Commonwealth nations. But  when Britain joined the European Common  Market this preferential status was gradually withdrawn.  . The European Community, as it is now known,  is an example of a free trade area that  includes mobility of labour and even a  common currency, for certain purposes,  called the ECU or European Currency Unit.  Canada is being forced to look for other  trading partners, including the developing countries, in order to prevent becoming more dependent on the U.S. for  trading opportunities.  My logging friend in B.C.  is in favour  of these talks with the U.S. yet my  sister-in-law's textile firm in Ontario  is opposed to them.  Why is that?  Traditionally there has been polarization in the regions of Canada in  attitudes towards free trade. Most Canadian secondary manufacturing industries,  like textile firms, are in Ontario and  Quebec. These regions have always felt  threatened by having to compete with  American products. They feel it is in  their interests to put up tariffs that  keep American competition out and help  them sell their goods in Canada.  It costs a lot to ship goods across the  length of Canada—say from Toronto to  Vancouver. Often it would be cheaper for  American companies to just ship across  the border—say from Seattle to Vancouver. Non-tariff barriers, for instance  Canadian-content guidelines, also can  help protect Canadian manufacturers from  competition with cheaper American imports.  Central Canada doesn't object to some  negotiated trade agreements. At present,  the Auto Pact is a Canada-U.S. agreement  that governs the trade in automobiles and  parts between manufacturers. (Tariffs remain for purchasers of automobiles—we  can't buy a duty-free car in Seattle or  Detroit.) The Auto Pact has language that  ensures that there will be a balance (over  time) between automobiles and parts made  in Canada and the U.S. for each other's  markets. Ontario and Quebec don't mind  • this kind of "freer" trade agreement.  Western Canada and the Atlantic region,  however, export raw and semi-raw materials.  They need machinery to produce and process  these raw materials (sawmill equipment,  farm equipment, mining equipment). Free  trade would make it more efficient and less  costly to buy this machinery from the  nearest (U.S.)' producer. But central Canada would not benefit—at least not immediately and directly. So the free trade  debate in Canada promises again to be  one of those East and West versus the Centre  clashes. Already anti-free trade sentiment  is rising in Ontario—not so much in B.C.  Tell me more how free trade will affect  women in particular.  That's in next month's issue.  V*S|Ut~   -TVlArr /VvC^kJ  /*<+**.

ARTS  The Color Purple  Alice  Walker  risks  Hollywood  by Kim Irving  I suppose my first inkling of doubt arose  when the local representative of Warner  Bros, called the Women's Liberation line  to inquire if "we" had heard of the  book The Color Purple  by Alice Walker,  and their new film of the same name. He  nervously explained that his boss had  told him to call "women's groups" and  "black groups" to invite "them" to a  screening.  My doubts grew when I saw the movie  poster, with the male actors receiving top billing, even though the major '  roles were by women. So with skepticism  I attended the screening, unsure of  .what to expect. I left the film as most  of the audience did: with tear-filled eyes  and in stunned silence. I was rather  surprised that I liked it. It wasn't till  a few days later, after a second screening,  that my criticisms developed.  Firstly, for those who are not familiar  with The Color Purple,  the story spans  35 years in the life of Celie, a rural  southern (American) black woman. Through  a series of letters to God, and later  to her sister Nettie, Celie describes  giving birth to two children fathered  by a man she knows as "Pa," who takes  the babies away from her at birth  and refuses to tell her about their  fate.  Celie is then given to a man she calls  "Mr.," a widower with four children,  who beats and sexually abuses her.  Nettie comes to live with Celie but  is soon chased away by Mr.'s sexual  advances. She escapes to Africa with a  missionary couple, who, we later JLearn,  have adopted Celie's children.  The story continues with Celie's relation to Mr.'s son Harpo, Harpo's wife  Sophia and Squeak, Harpo's girlfriend.  But it's when Shug, a blues singer and  past lover of Mr.'s, comes to _visit that  the story really starts. Shug and Celie  become lovers, and through this relationship Celie develops an awareness of  her worth and her ability to change the  world around her.  Eventually, Celie leaves Mr. to be with  Shug in Memphis. When she returns, her  Pa has died and she inherits a home and  business. In the end, Nettie returns  from Africa with Celie's grown children,  and Mr. seems reformed.  Director Steven Spielberg, best known  for his adventure films Jaws, Raiders of  the Lost Ark,  E.T.  and Gremlins,   teamed *•  Spielberg doesnt explore Celie's (left) sexual awakening with  up with his buddy, composer Quincy Jones  (producer of Michael Jackson's "Thriller"  album and the "We are the World" recording), and together they approached  Alice Walker for the film rights.  Spielberg hired screenwriter Menno Meyjes,  known for his children's dramas, to  adopt Walker's extensive novel for the  screen.  Yet despite Meyjes's work and Walker's  influence—part of the agreement Walker  made with Spielberg was that she be consulted during production and that "the  population of the film be of women,  blacks or Third World people"—Spielberg's  imprint is evident throughout the film.  And then there are plain stupid  scenes, like Mr. adding gasoline to a live fire in the stove—  a ten year-old would have more  sense. Spielberg's interpretation effectively diminishes  the tyranny of these men,  which Walker has portrayed  in her book.  With Disney-like simplicity, he presents  conventionalized images of violence  against women (Mr. is portrayed as big and  sly), racism (reduced to a slapstick humour),  Africa (very National Geographic)  and love.  Spielberg's preoccupation with boyish  antics results in the men being portrayed  as playful (witness the egg fight between  Mr. and Grandy, Shug's husband; or the barroom brawl scene; or Harpo's plunge through  no less than three roofs). And then there  are plain stupid scenes, like Mr. adding  gasoline to a live fire in the stove—a  ten year-old would have had more sense.  Spielberg's interpretation effectively  (perhaps purposely) diminishes the tyranny  of these men, which Walker has portrayed  in her book.  Other flaws mar the film. The inconsistent  aging (does Nettie ever get old?), poor  staging of actors, sweeping camera angles  and the invisible-orchestra soundtrack  that accompanies Shug's singing performances make the film less credible.  Perhaps the most manipulative technique  is syrupy music that clings to every  dramatic scene. You never quite know if  your emotional response is to the images  on the screen or to the wailing violins  in the background.  Shug because "he didnt want to turn absolutely everyone off/  Equally problematic is the^.ill-conceived  and inappropriate juxtaposition of Celie's  shaving of Mr.—we are led to believe  that she wants to murder him—and an  African tribal ritual of face tatooing,  between which there seems to be no  correlation, unless we imagine murder to be  the equivalent of African tribal rituals  The development of Celie's lesbian sexuality, which Walker so sensitively narrates in her book, is unconvincing in  the film, and turns on a few teasing  kisses. Spielberg didn't feel that it was  necessary to explore1 Celie's sexual  awakening with Shug because he "didn't  want to turn absolutely everyone off  by being top graphic. As it is, it's  a good movie for teenagers to see," he  said in the Globe and Mail.   This is an  incredible statement from a man who seems  to have no scruples about depicting heterosexual relationships or extreme violence in his other films.  Though it's obvious that Spielberg felt  compelled to portray Walker's book as  accurately as possible (some of Walker's  best lines are in the movie), the book's  inconsistencies become more blatant in  the film. Because Walker's novel fails  to address such issues as class and  money (what ever happened to the Depression of the thirties?) and the film  does, too the characters lack depth. Mr.'s  work is never explained, and confusion  results at the end of the film when  Celie is shown operating a business  (where did she get the experience?).  What saves the film are the excellent  performances by Deserta Jackson as the  young Celie (a very warm, faultless  adaption), Whoopi Goldberg as the adult  Celie arid Oprah Winfrey as Sophia.  Not surprisingly, critics sit on opposite  sides of the fence with their reviews  of The Color Purple.   Indeed, the film has  posed serious conflicts for some feminists, who swore they would never (again)  attend a Spielberg film, yet feel a  sense of obligation to support Walker's  work.  Controversy also stems from the picketing  of the film by the group "Coalition Against  Black Exploitation" at its Los Angeles  premiere. This group reflected concerns of  viewers who felt that the film was too sexually explicit (it promoted lesbianism) and  that it stereotyped black folk language and  black men as being violent.  Color Purple continued page 23 Kinesis February 1986   21  ARTS  The rest is up to you  by Jill Pollack  For the past year Lorna Mulligan has been  working on a series of drawings and paintings titled Inhabit.  As she says, they  "concern the problems of representation  and sexuality which focus on the everyday  activities of the domestic/work situation.'  The pieces are a combination of a perceived  reality and the dreamlike. Each presents a  definable narrative scenario couched in  somewhat ethereal terms. Alongside a depiction of a room or partial room, Mulligan  has injected her feelings about the scenario  vis-a-vis the stereotype of the situation.  Finely rendered markings, .usually white,  invade the image and remind the viewer that  what is presented is part ambiguity, part  reality.  This technique runs through the series,  tying it together and emphasizing the mood  of time-past. Because of the placement/  appearance of these markings, the works  seem to illustrate the memory of an experience. That reminiscence is simultaneously  non-peopled, somewhat chilling and occasionally humourous.. The paintings act as a  comment on existence, albeit focusing on  its futile side. A lone chair faces a  television set. A disengaged phone sits on  an empty table. A staircase leads to darkness. The series speaks of promise, of  waiting and of loneliness.  There is a sense of slowing down, of reflection (again, augmented by the border  markings). Each work is a bit of the  larger whole, put together in Domestic  A he artist has freeze-f rained  life, zoomed in and covered  the lens with gel.  Icons  and then isolated in single  paintings. Whereas Domestic Icons  presents the overview, the rest of the  series are close-ups, enlarged glimpses  of the physical traces of a life.  Mulligan is using this series as an  opportunity to examine the "house in  which she lives." Multiplicity of feelings  and activities abound. The "house"  depicted is not only a physical one but an  emotional/psychological state. The artist  has freeze-framed a life, zoomed in and  covered the lens with gel.  What she discovered seems to be at once  exalting and debilitating. When the  situation presented is extracted from a  larger whole, by the very nature of such  a highlighting it is emphasized. The act  of isolation is, in and of itself, a  clue to meaning, an inducement to concentrated viewing. Not only a successful  technique for cohering the series, it  speaks of the intentions of the maker.  She wants us to consider the factors  which contribute to the overall.  So on the one hand Mulligan has offered  up scenarios of daily existence to the  viewer, and on the other hand she has  presented a pensive and emotional rendering of her perceptions of a life.  Mulligan has ensured that a range of per- j  spectives are included. As a result, the j  potentially hard-hitting aspects of the  j  imagery are softened. At the same time,  inherent in the manner in which she has \  portrayed the various narratives there  1  is a provision for emotional relief.    j  Primarily because of the colours she has  utilized, Mulligan's paintings become  the memory of a situation which once  occurred but is now resolved—for heir,  anyways.  Lush, Rousseau-like colours show up in  every work. There is the feeling that  Mulligan enjoyed using colours because  of their positive emotional values as  well as their contradictory effect. In  fact, it is this duality which augments  the power of each piece. There is no  sense of the drab. While the narrative  may deal with oppressiveness, the  approach in part alleviates the burden:  a sort of "finding a bright spot."  One piece,- Afternoon Phonecall,  depicts-  a long table with a chair at either  end, and a disengaged phone. The title  places the work in temporal terms, and  the way in which the painting is rendered places it in emotional terms.  Someone answered the phone and was either  called away or has gone to get the  person for whom the phone was intended.  Or, perhaps, it has been purposefully  left off the hook in an attempt to deny  communication. Even with the number of  possible interpretations, it is easy  to relate to this image. Memory is  jogged and connections are made.  Mulligan has chosen an activity (or non-  activity) which is then imbued with  significant meaning. We do not have to  struggle to understand the iconography  because it is so familiar. Instead, we  can focus our attention on the ideas  behind the image. ^-q£|"*f-'  The approach taken in this and other  paintings in the series forms a coexistence between that which is presented and the way in which it is  identified/perceived. Mulligan has  wrapped the imagery not with the injection of the human form, but with  the overlay of memory ties and familiar  objects.

Exactly  what it represents is up to individual  interpretation and identification. This  is made clear by the artist's intentionally ambiguous renderings. In fact, that  seems to be one of Mulligan's aims: to  leave the reading of each painting as  open as possible.  A major strength of the series, along  with the artist's visual and technical  skills, lies in its perceptual mutability.

Some manifestations of racism are  easily recognized—for instance, in  employment practices.  Exploitive employment conditions and  their resulting physical and emotional  stresses aggravate abusive relationships. Immigrant workers, especially  those who are non*English-speaking,  are very often expected to work long  hours for little pay.  "In one instance the batterer works  15 hours a day at the minimum wage."  Underemployment or unemployment are  also common among immigrant "workers  and take their toll in undermining the  self-esteem of the husband. He is not  able to be the "breadwinner" and may  resort to violence as a means of imparting his dominant status.  On the community level, there is reluctance to openly acknowledge the  occurence of wife-battering. Fear exists  that such an admission would evoke  "shame and a negative image in an  already racist society." Amplifying this  fear is the knowledge that mainstream  media often focus only on publicizing  "negative" images of cultural minorities.  Ng recommends that the community use  available media to address the issues  of spousal assault but notes that the  Chinese-Canadian community requires cooperation from mainstream media to  avoid strengthening racist stereotypes.  "The stereotypes of inscrutable Charlie  Chan, of retarded, sadistic and sexless  Chinese males and slinky, exotic, submissive, passionate and obedient Chinese  females...are some that summarize the  negative, racist and sexist images that  the community already has to confront."

For many women the language  barrier remains for a prolonged period  of time. Ng has worked with women who  have been in Canada for as long as 15  years and who cannot speak a word of  English. Many of the community resource  people Ng interviewed said that Chinese-  Canadian battered women require interpreters when using community services.  Many batterers, on the other hand, are  more fluent in English, often having  been in Canada longer and having worked  outside the home. Survivors say their  husbands actively discourage them  from attending English classes because  "they perceive' the women's gaining of  knowledge of the dominant language as  a threat to the men's control over  them...."  "In some situations where women persist  in attending classes, batterers use  various means to humiliate and to  degrade them for what they accomplish  at school."  Batterers are not alone in creating  barriers to language classes. Recent  government cutbacks have created  further obstacles. Tuition fees have  risen, and the number of government-  sponsored programs has decreased.  Ng points out that women without a  working knowledge of English are  less likely to be aware of community  services and so are less likely to  use them.  Their inability to speak English compounds their isolation, and some  women, who immigrated without their  own families, believe they must remain with their husband and his fam-  ily.  Ng's study consistently documents  the need for bilingual workers within  community services, human resources,  the justice system, etc. Bilingual  services, she believes, would help  ease the intense isolation faced by  non-English-speaking women.  Taking all of these problems into  consideration—racism, immigration  policies, language and cultural  traditions—it is clear that Chinese-  Canadian survivors of violence face  a complex system of isolating factors.  Though unable to give quantitative  statistics, Ng's study, with its  contextual approach, does give a  comprehensive overview of the problem.

My point is that almost without exception, I have always ended my year of  in struggle  by participating in the  holiday season. Call me sentimental.  Call me politically flawed. It doesn't  matter. But it is for this reason  that I wasn't too shook up by the release of Snow Angel,   Cris Williamson's  new Christmas album on Olivia Records.  Traditionally some of the most radical  Christmas music has come from artists  in the black community (James Brown's  "Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto"  is a personal favourite), and country  music has given us Christmas food for  thought about deserted families and  the end of all hope.  Snow Angel  is not a radical record. But  it is certainly original, personal,  hopeful and preferable to most available holiday music. However, Christmas  is a holiday with a bad reputation in  some communities. For this reason  Snow Angel  is also a challenge.  On the subject of peace, in "Greetings  of the Season," written by Shelby Flint,  Cris sings, When the world astounds us/  and we question what is true/ may the  message of this season/ still be there/  to lift us up and see us through.  And in Tret Fure's "Peace on Earth,"  ahe says, We can have joy all through  the year/ and we can have love all  through the year/ but what we could  really use most of all/ through the  year/ is peace on earth.  Also included on Snow Angel  is a  reading of Carl Sandburg's poem "Star  Silver," followed by a medley of traditional Christmas carols. But the selections have more to do with snow,  stars and angels than other Christmas  Imagery. Cris also sings "The Christmas Song" (chestnuts roasting on an  open fire, etc.) accompanied by the  great Novi Novog on viola.  One interesting addition is James  Taylor's "Shower the People," a mellow  sappy song that I always sang along with  when I heard it on the radio (and secritly  liked). My least favourite song is  Carol Hall's "Hard Candy Christmas."  No reason really. It just doesn't  grab me the way "In Excelsis Deo" does.  If you are familiar with Cris Williamson's music, then you have a good idea  what this album sounds like. Cris has  an angelic, melodic voice, and her music  is soft and without a lot of frills.  She is assisted by musicians Tret Fure  (who engineered and co-produced the  album),,Carrie Barton, Shelby Flint,  Jeannette Wraite, and as mentioned  before, Novi Novog.  Cris Williamson  Will the woman who wrote some of the  most powerful women's liberation anthems  of the seventies, who sang in women's  prisons and for native causes, and who  stood on lines some of us have yet to  draw, be allowed  to express on record  some holiday sentiments and spiritual  wishes? I don't know. But I do know that  it has yet to be•determined whether or  not believing in peace on earth and  singing about it during December is  counter-revolutionary.  A snow angel is, of course, what appears  when you fall down in the snow on your  back and move your arms and legs up  and down. The title track is from the  point of view of a young girl, presumably Cris, who can still see her snow  angel in the yard from her bedroom  window, despite the heavy snowfall.  Cris also tells a story about a Christmas haircut, and in the song "Wishbook"  she recalls the Christmas her parents  gave her an envelope full of cutouts  from a catalogue.  Merry Christmas little one/this is  just until the money comes.  These are  not the memories of an affluent youngster. £&l&fe|  Color Purple continued from page 20  These criticisms have raised questions  about Hollywood's ability to portray  black imagery and lifestyles. What were  Spielberg's intentions in producing The  Color Purple,   considering that his other  films have largely been misogynist and  often racist? Who but a white male filmmaker would be trusted with a $14 million  budget to produce a movie about black  Americans?  Since Hollywood does not have a glowing  history of commitment to black films,  especially black women's films, we can  assume that it must have been an "agonizing  decision for Walker to trust Spielberg  to bring her novel to film.  In an interview in the Dec.'85 issue of  Ms. Magazine,   Walker explained why she  handed over the film rights: "So much  of my constituency just doesn't read. I  knew that people in my hometown (Eatonton,  Georgia) might not read the book...but I  knew they would see the film. I wanted  it to be there, to appear in the  villages."  According to Coming Up,   a lesbian/gay  newspaper from San Francisco, the  first time Walker saw the film "she didn't  like it. She felt the characters in  the movie were nDt the characters in  her novel." Apparently Walker mourned  for a week. But then Walker saw the  film again "and this time she loved it.  She said that if you looked at it for  what it was and forgot about her book  it was a beautiful film."  As I walked out of the second screening  of The Color Purple,   I realized that my  criticisms of it were based on my distaste  for Spielberg's filmmaking techniques. Yet  somehow Walker's enriching story survives  amazingly well, despite his "manhandler"  techniques. It's Celie's story that makes  this an important and worthy film.  Walker took a risk with Hollywood producing her novel. Let's hope her gamble  pays off. 24 Kinesis February 198fr  by Wendy Frost and Michele Valiquette  Whatever the nature of your feminist involvement, whether as a trade unionist,  a community organizer, an environmentalist,  a student or a reader, you'll find something to interest you in women's periodicals. Hundreds of journals, magazines,  newsletters and newspapers are published  every year in North America alone. They  range from popular to academic, from  those providing comprehensive coverage of  women's issues to those focusing on specific themes such as lesbian culture, health  issues, work, the peace movement, etc.  In future columns we'll be looking at the  contents of various journals in more detail. At this point, we want to back up  a bit and talk about how to find the particular journal or article you need.  Patience and footwork are the key:  the  process may just as easily take you  through indexes in the public library as  boxes in someone's basement.  Guides to Women's Periodicals  By far the most comprehensive reference  available, and the best place to get a  sense of the scope of women's publications,  is the International Guide to Women 's  Periodicals.   The guide was published annually as issue # 4 of Resources for Feminist  Research  until the Dec./Jan. 1981-82 issue.  It provides listings of women's periodicals, organized by country, with short  descriptions of the journals' availability,  cost, frequency of publication, and address.  It also includes information on an international scale about archives, research  and cultural centres, women's presses and  women's bookstores. The last complete guide  was published in 1981-82 and is still  available for about $5 from Resources for  Feminist Research,  O.I.S.E., 252 Bloor  St. W., Toronto, Ontario M5S 1V6. You can  also consult the guide at the UBC and SFU  libraries, and at the Vancouver Public  Library. Another complete guide is planned  for the end of 1986. Meanwhile, updates  appear from time to time in regular issues  of RFR. fe&J"7  The International Directory of Little  Magazines and Small Presses,  published  annually, is a similar guide which includes  many feminist journals, particularly those  with a literary hent.  A somewhat dated though still useful  source book is Guide to Women's Publishing,   by Polly Joan and Andrea Chesman,  published by Dustbooks, Paradise, California, in 1978. Their emphasis is on  American' material, and the book includes  sections on women's journals, newspapers,  presses, and distribution networks, as  well as introductory discussions of the  theory and practice of feminist publishing.  In addition to feminist journals, other  periodicals and magazines sometimes publish special issues on women. Women: A  Bibliography of Special Periodical Issues  (Toronto: Ontario Institute for Studies  in Education, 1976-78) lists these.  Resources for Feminist Research  publishes  regular updates of special issues.  The above-mentioned guides offer a wealth  of information on the breadth of existing  publications, and give some indication as  to which journals cover which topics. But  what if you're interested in reading more  about a specific issue, such as women in  jazz, or feminist research on VDTs, or  black women writers, and don't want to  search at random? To direct you to particular topics, there are a variety of  sources which index periodical literature;  that is, they survey a large number of  journals and provide lists of titles of the  articles to be found in these journals,  organized by topic.  Women's Studies Abstracts,   for example,  has been publishing for over a decade  and covers a wide variety of women's  studies topics. If you wanted information  onwjmen in the peace movement, for  instance, you could look under that heading, and would find a list of articles  on this subject and information on  where and when they were published. The  index comes out quarterly and can be  found at the Vancouver Public Library,  at SFU, at UBC and at most college libraries .  Studies on Women Abstracts  is a relatively  new index from England which provides  similar information. It is published  bimonthly and is now available at UBC.  The Alternative Press Index,   a quarterly  index of "alternative and radical publications," covers a number of feminist  journals, as well as periodicals on left  politics, the environment, gay rights,  etc. This is a good source for feminist  articles. It is available "in the reference section of most university, college,  and public libraries.  As well as using these formal sources,  you can learn a lot from footnotes in  feminist books and articles. If you find  an article that interests you, turn to  the notes and check out who the author  has been reading, and where. We're both  footnote addicts, and have picked up a  lot of valuable information this way.  Where to Find Women 's Periodicals  Knowing that an article or a journal  exists is one thing; finding it can be  quite another. (If anyone out there has  issue #4 of Sinister Wisdom,  we've been  looking for it for three years and would love  to borrow it!) Like women in the workforce—last hired, first fired—women's  journals in libraries are often last acquired, first chopped. This is especially  true for non-academic journals and women's  newspapers. In the current climate of  cutbacks, new women's journals, whatever  their nature, are less and less likely to  be picked up. Herizons,  Sage,  Tulsa Studies  in Women's Literature    and Trivia  are all  journals which have begun publishing in the  last few years but cannot be found on local  library shelves. Be sure to let the library  know when you're looking for a journal they  don't carry. Numbers of requests may have  some effect on new acquisitions.  To compound the problems of availability,  many women's publications have small circulations and cannot afford to distribute  widely. From the other end, women's bookstores can often only afford to carry a  limited number of journals. Turnover may  be slow, and while journals can usually be  returned, postage costs, especially to  other countries, are prohibitively high.  But even when they are available in bookstores, buying journals in large numbers  is beyond the means of most women, as is  subscribing to more than one or two. If you-  can  afford to subscribe, do so; little magazines in particular depend on subscriptions  for survival. But, if you can't, here are  a few tips on how to get hold of women's  publications at little or no cost.  Libraries  "Little magazines." SFU, for example, has  the entire runs of Makara  and Chrysalis,   as  well as Off Our Backs  and The Pedestal,  forerunner of Kinesis.   For those interested  in the beginnings of the current wave of  the women's movement, try the Herstory  Microfilm Collection at UBC, produced  by the Women's History Library of Berkeley,  California. The selection of Journals,  newsletters and newspapers goes up to  Sept. 1971, and here you'll find such  things as issues of Lesbian Tide,   from  1970-71; Velvet 'Fist,   a Toronto paper,  also from 1970-71; and The Ladder,   a  national publication of the Daughters  of Bilitis, from its first issue in 1956  to 1971.  At most universities you don't have to  be a student to use the library. Periodicals are generally classed as reference material and are non-circulating;  anyone can have access to them. Libraries will often print guides to their own  periodical holdings, and reference  librarians, are usually more than willing  to help you find what you're looking for.  The particular advantage of libraries is  that they store back issues, which can  otherwise be extremely difficult to  obtain.  But what if you're trying to get a copy  of a particular article that you already  have a reference for—perhaps through  one of the indexes we mentioned earlier—  and the journal isn't in the library?  Then, you need the interlibrary loan  system. This is a network of public,  university and college libraries throughout North America. If you are a member  of the Vancouver Public Library, or a  student or external card-holder at any  B.C. college or university, you have  access to the system. Most libraries  will have a special form for ordering  articles this way. It is usually necessary to have all publication details:  title, author, volume number, date and  page numbers. Sometimes you may be  required to pay copying costs, but you  can specify an upper limit. If the  journal is available at one. of the libraries in this network, within a few  weeks you'll receive a copy of your  article.  The best Canadian collection of women's  periodicals that we've seen is located  at the Women's Resource Centre of the  Ontario Institute for Studies in  Education, in Toronto. The centre is  informal, the staff are very helpful, and  they've even responded to our written  requests for assistance. The best North  American collection we've heard of and  would give our eye teeth to see is at  the University of Wisconsin in Madison.  A catalogue of their holdings, ranging  from the 18th century to 1981, is  available in the UBC reference room.  Other Sources:  The problems mentioned above notwithstanding, a number of women's publications can  be found in public and university libraries,  and these are good places to begin browsing.  Libraries tend to carry the more academic  or established journals, such as Signs,  Atlantis, Feminist Studies,  Women's Studies,  Women's Studies International Quarterly,  International Journal of Women's Studies,  etc.  In addition, libraries may carry a somewhat  idiosyncratic selection of so-called  For those of us who can't afford to  travel and have exhausted the libraries  (or are exhausted by them), there are  still alternatives. Magazines and newspapers often receive copies of other  journals. Kinesis,  for example, keeps  all of those received in the last two  years on file. Other places in Vancouver that keep small collections of  women's publications are the Women's  Centre at SFU, the Women's Resource  Centre and the Canadian Book Information Centre. In addition to these, other  community-based women's centres may have  similar resources, so check them out.  That's it for our free tips. The remaining obvious sources are women's and  left bookstores. Among them, the Women's  Bcokstore, Ariel, Octopus East and West,  and Spartacus carry a good selection of  current women's papers and journals.  Next month, for the International Supplement, this column will feature selected feminist journals from around the  world. Until then, happy searching! From  then on we'll be appearing monthly. Kinesis February 1986   25  A little  night reading  by Cy-Thea Sand  The Heart of the Race:  Black Women 's Lives in Britain  by Beverley Bryan,  Stella Dadzie and  Suzanne Scafe  Virago Press,   1985  250 pages.  London.  One of many noteworthy features of this  anthology is its structure. The book has  three authors but one narrative voice  is presented. Not only does this  give the work cohesiveness, continuity  and smoothness, it also creates a cooperative, unified force to the telling  of history. Good-bye to the dryness and  tedium of mainstream history texts:  The Heart of the Race  is as moving and  engaging as the best of fiction should  be.  Interspersed throughout are the voices of  many Black women who speak about their  own experience under the various categories  explored: Black women in/on labour; education; health; welfare; political organizing and culture. Oral herstory is a part  of each chapter in a vibrant, potent way.  The authors write that "(their) sense of  self cannot be divorced from (their)  collective consciousness because every  statement underscores the reality of a  poor and oppressed people struggling to  be free."  In their introduction Bryan, Dadzie and  Scafe acknowledge the work done by Black  American women in breaking the silences  between the work of Black men writing on  their history and white feminists articulating white women's history. The  American work inspired their own exploration of the unique British experience of  Black women: their immigration problems,  and how exploited women workers are,  especially in the National Health Service;  the reality of being targets for probation  and police officers who are described as  being "the most prejudiced and bigoted  group of civil servants in the country and  a breeding ground for right-wing racists";  their struggle for a decent education for  themselves and their children and the  overall determination'and brillance with  which every obstacle is faced.  I was disappointed that nothing on gay  people is included. I recently saw the  video Framed Youth,   produced by the Gay  and Lesbian Youth Project of England, in  which a young Black gay woman is interviewed. One of the things she mentions is  that her mother! blames her lesbianism on  the influences of the white people in her  life. I want to know more about the experience and perspectives of gay Black  women in Britain, but they are conspicuously absent in this work.  The Heart of the Race  ends with a comprehensive bibliography and a list of Black  women's groups. Read this one for sure,  pass it around, insist that your library  order it and help get it into your school'  curriculum.  My Mama 's Dead Squirrel  Lesbian Essays on Southern Culture  by Mab Segrest  237 pages.  New York:  Firebrand Books,   1985.  It is heartening to know that so many of  us fall through the cracks of our socialization to become like the people our  parents warned us about. At one point in  this collection of her essays, which have  been published in various books, periodicals and newspapers over the years, Mab  Segrest quotes Rita Mae Brown's belief  that "change is not a convulsion of  history but the slow, steady push of  people over decades." Using herself as a  barometer and guided by an intense, vibrant honesty, Segrest dissects the  southern culture she was raised in, specifically the pressure points of racism,  classism and homophobia.  Adrienne Rich says in her introduction  that this work will interest anyone who  is concerned with "literary history, gay  history, women's history, .Southern history, and the crisis of present-day  America." I found in Segrest's anti-Klan  reporting some of the most powerful information on racist violence I have read,  and in her literary essay entitled Lines  I Dare,   a fine example of the possibilities of feminist literary criticism. I  was pleased to read more about the white  anti-racist, Lillian Smith (a review copy  of her 1944 novel Strange Fruit  landed  on my desk recently, having been republished by the University of Georgia Press).  Segrest connects contemporary lesbian  writers to women like Lillian Smith,  Carson McCullers and Angeline Weld Grimke  with their shared themes of "repression,  the triple jeopardy of the Black lesbian,  the concern in both Black and white work  with the grotesque, the need for a political understanding to preserve life and  sanity, the awareness of the inter-relat-  edness of oppressions, the figure of the  fugitive and the need to bust free." This  connecting of women writers over time  using a kind of feminist intuitive thread  is also at the heart of another recent  collection of essays—Judy Grahn's  The Highest Apple: Sappho and The Lesbian  Poetic Tradition (Spinsters,  Ink.  1985).  The title essay is funny and moving in  its relentless attack on manners as the  embodiment of lies which distort and kill.  Segrest's interview with Barbara Deming  closes this work, which is an important  contribution to the growing library of  progressive cultural criticism.  The Handmaid's Tale   .  By Margaret Atwood  324 pages.  Toronto:  McClelland & Stewart,   1985.  The Handmaid's Tale  turns the bad dreams  of right-wing fundamentalism into  nightmarish reality. If you ever long  for order out of our world's messy,  dramatic changes, reading this novel may  change your mind. Atwood takes the rant-  ings of Jerry Falwell to their logical  conclusion: a patriarchal fascist regime  where women function according to the  biological needs of the state. Women are  divided into role types reminiscent of  Marge Piercy's Women On The Edge Of .Time.  The novel's unrelenting tension is created  by a covert threat of danger similar to  the fear in the film Missing.  Violence is  ever present but never directly witnessed.  We learn about the republic of Gilead—  formerly the United States of America—  through the thoughts of Offred. She is a  surrogate breeder in the home of a Com-  ander whose first name is Fred. Her non-  name is what Atwood calls "a patronymic,  composed of the possessive preposition  and the first name of the gentleman who  owns her." Offred's job is to get pregnant and bear a healthy child for the  ; commander and his wife. Failure to do so  within a prescribed time will lead to  banishment to the Colony of Unwomen,  where women are worked and starved to  death. Offred says of handmaids: "We are  two-legged wombs, that's all: sacred  vessels, ambulatory chalices."  British feminist Sue Cartledge suggests  that "we are living between worlds, between a world of habits, expectations  and beliefs that are no longer viable,  and a future that has yet to be constructed." Margaret Atwood has jumped into  this matrix of gender and sex politics  to shake us up and warn us. The declining Caucasian birthrate precipitates a  massive roundup of young women who are  then forced to iaecome breeders for elite  couples. The most compelling parts of  this narrative occur when Offred thinks  about her previous life with her husband  and daughter and how she paid but scant  attention to the gradual eroding of  democratic rights. Her hellish existence  dramatizes our worst fears when we  listen to advocates of law, order and  androcentric logic. This suspenseful  work gets us where we live—now—when  shrill reactionary voices resound daily  in mainstream culture and politics.  The Accidental Tourist  by Anne Tyler  355 pages. Markham,  Ontario:  Penguin Books.  1985.  Whether you are an ardent Anne Tyler fan  or a reader as yet unfamiliar with the  exquisite pleasure of reading her, The  Accidental Tourist awaits. Clear away1 a  place- and time to enjoy Tyler's latest  in one sitting if possible. You'll be  laughing one minute and crying the next  as this talented wordsmith enters her  unique never-never land of human relationships. Tyler's characters seem to bounce  into and off of each other like confused  atoms: her brilliance captures the emotional logic in the confusion which makes even  the most low-key characters unforgettable.  Macon Leary writes travel brochures for  business travellers, loses his son  tragically and is left by his wife. He is  constantly troubled by Edward, an incorrigible Welsh corgi who belonged to Macon's  murdered son. Edward barks,, growls and  snarls his way into full character status,  which is rare in modern fiction. Macon  cannot give up his only remaining connection  to his son, and Edward's obedience training precipitates Macon's meeting Muriel  Pritchett, whose gutsy determination  changes Macon's life.  This is the funniest Tyler novel to date.  I was laughing out loud as Muriel and  Edward match wits and stubbornness while  Macon's reserved despair shapes the scene.  Tyler's genuine delight in her characters  is irresistible; she always succeeds in  making the stranger at the bus stop appear  as intriguing and complex as the most  baffling mathematical equation. Macon  Leary as the accidental tourist "loved the  writing, the virtuous delights of organizing a disorganized country, stripping  away the inessential and the second-rate."  This description fits Tyler's craft as well,  as she plays with the logic and chaos in  fictional life with a juggler's dexterity  and timing.

This  absence is particularly remarkable  when one is aware that, for the  organizers, the primary goal of the  conference was to "move the debate  on sexual imagery into a new dimension" (Sara Diamond, Out of Line,  Nov. 22, 1985.)  One assumes that when one is moving a  debate into new dimensions one must,  of necessity, grapple with new ideas,  new positions and new strategies. This  simply did not happen. Instead the  conference presented us with an  opportunity to listen to a number of  well-known advocates of a particular  point Of view on sexuality, imagery  and, yes indeed, censorship.  Women such as Sara Diamond, Lisa Steele,  Varda Burstyn, Amber Hollibaugh, Sue  Golding and Cindy Patton are well known  to feminists with even a passing acquaintance with issues around sexual representation, practise and censorship-.,  Their analysis and positions are well  known.  For years'now we have heard of alternative imagery, an end to morality that  stifles, the dangers of state censorship,  andi, of. course, the importance of sex - ,  education in the schools. I should note ,  here: that-1 do,p-'.t;.eare if £a certain '-%£'&  -,  position-on any issue?wants fe^-organize.,  a conference -to ;recruit, troops^ Realiyj&^fc.'.  we do-it all the time. I very definitely  mind, however, being treated like the  wife who doesn't know what is going on.  "The Heat Is On" took a particular  point of view; disguised it by talking of a search for hew dimensions;  protected it by presenting no opposition to its position (and by a few  other things as well, e.g., the presence of men and structure); isolated  it from examiniation, criticism and  debate; and finally, promoted it as  the only solution to a vital and  complex dilemma.  The second most striking aspect of the  conference was that this seemed to go  over very well. Certainly the public perception was of a daring but safe and  satisfying exploration of sex issues.  The audience, with exactly three  exceptions throughout all of Saturday  and Sunday, didn't have a single awkward question. This of course is partly  because many who represent other particular points of view weren't there. Most  of the audience participation was devoted  to how remarkable it was to be there and  how scary it was to talk about sex. One  woman told a story about her difficulty  in arranging mutual times for sex. There  was also'a great deal of talk about art.  Not-a lot of the art discussion, surprisingly,' was actually about sex.  Another point about audience participation was that it was relatively low. There  were a lot of panels, and panels traditionally do not leave a lot or room for audience participation. The conference was  also entirely structured on a single  large group format. Two hundred people  gathered anywhere tends to ensure little  active participation.  In stark contrast to my impressions  of a largely cliched and -dated discussion, women described the event as  daring (but safe), provocative and  challenging. Vancouver's alternative  media, without exception raved about  it. Certainly they did have the odd  complaint: the tokenism of the lone  woman-of-colour speaker was dutifully noted, but superlatives were  definitely in;  So it seemed that the audience response was extremely positive. But  that was another case of disguise.  Many women didn't speak of the dissatisfactions they had at the conference. Women who did make efforts  to confront aspects of the conference felt silenced. Some women felt,  what was the point of saying something—or more precisely, of saying  the same thing over and over again?  No one relished the prospect of being  the conference's token hopelessly  uptight, old-fashioned feminist.  And, finally, others simply felt  seduced, and only later thought  about what was not discussed, included or acknowledged.  I do not suggest that these reactions, or even rationalizations,  can or ought to be sole responsibility of the organizers. They.are included to point out that what '  appeared and was presented as the  unified experience of women at "The  Heat Is On" was, in fact, not the  case.  I am struck by the asymmetry of a  vital and complex dilemma such as  feminist perspectives on sex issues,  and the experience of so many at  the conference who felt that they  were involved in a "daring but safe"  exploration. T am keenly struck by  the inherent contradiction implicit  in an assessment like1 "daring and saf<  I wonder what it is that we are prepared for when we use such confusing  descriptions of what we experience.  T wonder what we want out of a new  dimension of sex if what is rooted  in our language is a willingness to  only go halfway—;to dare, in fact, ,  to be safe; to relax, in fact, while  we're seduced.  One of the commonly accepted assum-  tions at "The Heat Is On" was that  the dfifferences between feminists  on sex issues are irreconcilable.  "The Heat Is On" did not invent  this -idea; it is something that  thosexrwho. have extreme positions  on sex issues have been hurling at  each other for years now.

If, in Vancouver, we are going to  take on our own serious reconstruction of our feminist thought on sex  in all its dimensions,   then we need  an open conference. And if women  think they can't go there and be  safe, then maybe they should go there  and be unsafe. And maybe when we  leave, after we have survived, we  will really have something to think  about.

Many, times,  women officers of this Centre have to-:-  forgo their food so that others may  live.  To us this year, the occasion is a  special period of sober reflection  on all manmade sufferings created to  suppress, oppress, enslave and exploit our womenfolk and how we can  obviate these sufferings. With the  banning of the importation of rice  and: maize to Nigeria as announced by  our new controlled military junta  of General Babaginda on 1st 0ctpber; , ;  1985 thereby worsening our national'  food, supply, withdrawal of fertilizer  subsidy thereby crippling agriculture, withdrawal of petroleum subsidy  thereby crippling transportation,  rising inflation, etc. The future of  our inmates and women in the coming  year looks bleak and hopeless and one  wonders whether we shall see the  ending of the coming year. We pray  God to grant us the peace of death and  others fuller lives.  May the joys of this Christmas be  yours and may the New Year rekindle  our spirit of sisterhood, generosity,  love, togetherness and support for  our suffering and oppressed women.  In Sisterhood,  Hannah Edemikpong for the Women's...  Centre in Nigeria  In our May/85 issue  Kinesis carried a  letter appealing for funds and support  from this women's centre. Kinesis February 1986   27  LETTERS  Racism stops  Women and Words  An open letter to the Members of Women and  Words  and to the Community of Women.  We want to thank the women from across  Canada who shared in the vision of the  2nd Pan-Canadian Conference of Women and  Words  and who sent in comments and suggestions for workshops; however, the  black women and women of colour have  withdrawn from the organizing committee,  and we understand that there will be no  Pan-Canadian Women and Words'Conference  in Toronto in the summer of 1986.  Any organization that fights sexism must  also confront racism. It was our understanding that the conference was to  address the theme "Diversity is Strength,"  which in our understanding meant seeking  the full participation of women writers  (both self-identified and not) who have  been traditionally excluded from the mainstream and ensuring that the conference  address both the local and national concerns of women so that it would reflect  our diversity of language, race, class,  sexuality and geography. We were also  committed to increasing the representation of older women, younger women,  physically disabled women and poor women.  The focus was not to be on women writers  of the dominant race/class/language, but  rather on the women whom the larger  society has tried to mute.  In the interest of time, we will give but  few of the incidents that led to our  Withdrawal.  That we sought to draw in black women and  women of colour was seen as exclusionary  xvcther than affirmative, with the result  that we were told we ought to have done  more to make white women comfortable in  participating in the committee.  It "is an outrage that we who have been  excluded from all levels of the dominant  society since colonization began 500 years  ago are now expected to make white women's  comfort a priority.  We were criticized for not being "conciliatory," i.e. for challenging racist  remarks, for not smoothing over  "unpleasant" moments.  We were criticized  about how slowly we worked,  how information about the conference took long (sic)  in filtering through the "white women 's  literary community.  What was ignored is that in our efforts  to preserve the vision of the conference  most of the active work—the outreach  the phone calls, the rental of office  space, the incorporation of the society,  the raising of funds, etc.—fell on the  black women and women of colour.

There were complaints that white women  in the community  "felt like minorities,'^  indicating that they believed their  concerns would not be addressed.  To assume that we would exclude issues  that did/do not appear to affect us  directly is a projection and an insult.  It was suggested that we were being unrealistic in wanting to address racism/  multiculturalism and bilingualism.  What then was the conference about? Are  we to believe that women's writing is  divorced from these issues?  In withdrawing we wish to point out that:  •It is not our responsibility to comfort  and reassure white women who are unaccustomed to working with black women  and women of colour.  •Racist remarks and attitudes are not  open to conciliation and negotiation.  •Any women's conference that does not  seek to address a diversity of issues  affecting the lives of women serves  only women of the dominant race and  class.  •It is not the task of black women and  women of colour to educate white women  about racism.  In closing, we'd like to say that just  as we have worked successfully in the  past with white women who are confronting their racism, so too do we, in the  words of Audre Lorde, look forward to  working with "all women who can meet  us, face to face, beyond objectification  and beyond guilt." Unfortunately, the  Toronto Women and Words Committee does  not appear to be the place.  Makeda Silvera, Sharon Fernandez,  Michele Paulse, Stephanie Martin  No to therapy  and no apologies  Kinesis:  In the Dec./Jan. issue, Kinesis  chose  professional expertise over fact. It  pretended that Silva Tenenbein's well-  thought-out commentary had no relevance to  the professional's article she critiqued.  It invalidated a non-professional as  ignorant of the facts and having "difficulty1  with a concept. It then printed a glowing  acccount of therapy from a formerly  "disordered" but now satisfied customer.  I fully share and support Ms. Tenenbein's  opinion of the article. I hope at least  one woman is put off by Tenenbein's comments  on the selling of care. For her piece was  very much related to the issues the shrink  brought out; Suppose a professional writes  an article about the causes of lesbianism  and uses terminology such as "disordered,"  "syndrome," and "symptom." The shrink;then  signs off advertising his or her university  degree, treatment ideas and phone number.  Readers have every right to question the  shrink's concepts. Not only the medical-  izing of behaviour, but the economics  of treatment.  Ms. Tenenbeih was quite courageous in her  critique, given the women's community's  addiction to therapy.  I'm surprised her  words made it into print. What risk is  there in embracing conversation-for-  hire or "therapy" in such a supportive  and uncritical environment? Where are the  voices of the dissatisfied customers of  specific shrinks? Where are the packets  and brochures on "how and why not to  choose therapy"?1 Where are the books on  alternatives to paying 'cause we hurt?  If we're only offered therapy can we  talk about freedom of choice? Why don't  professionals ever mention their own  studies on the negative effects of  therapy?  To critique the selling of care in the  women's community invites not only  labels of psychopathology or psycho-  dynamic interpretations of one's  "problem with therapy," but apologies.  Ms. Friedman is naive to believe her  article is only about food and feelings.  If she didn't hope to net a few customers  after her statements, why would she include her credentials, a brief summary  of what she sells, and her phone number?  I wouldn't close this with my business  card degree letters because I consider  it inappropriate. The fact that Ms.  Friedman chose such a signoff gives her  article a different twist. One that Silva  Tenenbein picked up on.  The word "therapy" (curative medical  treatment) is mainly a marketing term  in advanced capitalist societies. We are  convinced of its importance by the sellers of therapy and by selected satisfied  customers. Within the article itself we  find other evidence of marketing terminology. "Eating Disorders" tops the title  of the piece. In the first paragraph  the seller/writer introduces the statistic that 72% of all women have an eating  disorder. Millions of potential customers  out there. Statistics, like faith, are  open to debate as proof of anything.  After we learn about the general eating  disorder, Ms. Friedman breaks down this  broad term to various diagnoses. We also  find "symptom" and "syndrome" to further  encourage our thinking in disease/cure  patterns. She then informs potential  customers that the prejudice against fat  people is the "single greatest cause of  self-hatred in our culture." She again  offers no reason for us to believe this.  Lots of us hate ourselves from time to  time. There is no single greatest cause  for this.  The advertiser/writer next informs readers that the fat prejudice causes more  than self-hate. It "breeds an endless  variety of other emotional disorders"  and "feeds a multibillion dollar industry dedicated to providing quick but  ineffectual solution." Her solution  is apparently neither "quick" nor  "ineffectual" but certainly feeds into  the multibillion dollar industry of con-  versation-for-hire. Shrinks need self-  hating folks while convincing us -that  we need them. The longer we pay money  for our pain, the better for their bank  accounts, feelings of self-worth, well-  being, and security.  I'm glad to read Ms. Tenenbein's commentary as it relates to the content of the  Friedman article. That we both have  "difficulty with the concept of therapy"  would be a misconception. We have no  difficulty; we simply disagree with its  pushers. I believe there is a danger in  the professionalization and labeling of  all aspects of our lives. Every week I  read of new symptoms and syndromes. Where  will it end? Why is this professionalized  version of labeling and treating for  money so powerful in the women's community that we can't even touch it without  somebody apologizing for us?  With no apologies  Delia Dubay  This letter has been edited for length 28   Kinesis February 1  I  "  LETTERS  Writer: where  is Kinesis policy?  Kinesis:  With reference to your orchestrated confrontation between myself and Sandy  Friedman, I don't think that Kinesis  is  the appropriate place to carry on a  lengthy dialogue on who meant what. However, I should point out, in response  to your apology on my behalf, that I was  asked to write a critical commentary  about Ms. Friedman's article. I was not  told at that time that Ms. Friedman had  been asked to write it.  This was a questionable tactic on your  part. I'm not surprised that the author  of the first solicited article feels unjustly attacked, under the circumstances.  She was, after all, only accommodating your  request. As was I.  As to the contents of my article: I have  no apology to make for what I said. I am  disinclined to condense and reiterate it,  because I don't want you to apologize for  this letter.  My response was directly  related to the  article "Food For Feelings." You—and  Ms. Friedman—might re-read it with that  in mind. I was and am in a position to  debate the contents of Ms. Friedman's  article, point by point. Perhaps sometime  there will be the appropriate forum to discuss such things at length.  I see this whole situation as a series of  major lapses in Kinesis  policy. Now that  you have apologized fdr me and retracted  my article, are you going to apologize to  me for your retraction? Will you, in the  next issue, have to retract that apology?  It seems to me that your policy on  responsibility for material, as printed  in the front of each issue, was developed  specifically to avoid problems like this.  I hope that this mess, which started when  you deviated from that policy, will give  you incentive to follow it more closely in  the future.  In exasperation,  Silva Tenenbein  Editor's Note: It is important to  note that Silva Tenenbein was told  to write a letter regarding her criticisms of Friedman 's article and was  not solicited by  Kinesis to write a  critique.  We do,  however,  take full  responsibility for not recognizing  and pointing out the problems we  had with Tenenbein's piece before  it was printed. We deeply regret any  harm this editorial oversight may  have caused Silva Tenenbein.  Gallery pleased  to provide forum  Kinesis:  When you experience pain, you can withdraw- and protect yourself.    But the  security of the lair can also be a trap.  -Louise Bourgeois  Women In Focus was co-host to The Heat  Is On  Conference the last weekend in  November 1985. It provided a forum to  discuss many issues surrounding sexuality,  some as expected and some surprising.  We were very pleased not only by the  overwhelming response, but also by the  myriad issues that were raised. What  could have turned into an intellectual.  emotions-denying discussion around censorship was instead a vibrant, often-  controversial three days of exploration.  Inherent in the nature of the raising of  issues, especially sexual ones, is a  variety of personal and political philosophies. Women In Focus is committed to  offering an outlet for the frank and  much-needed, discussion of the totality  of women's experiences, as expressed primarily through art, but not exclusively  through art. Our intention is not necessarily to promote specific answers to  feminist-oriented space where people  can determine their own individual and  collective answers.  We feel that art is not considered by  our society to be of high priority. But  it is through the expression of one's  creativity—on any subject deemed important by the maker—which has the potential to allow us to look at who we are  and how we got there. Whether it is a  beautiful piece of art or a work which  deals with pain, we cannot be afraid to  look and then decide how we feel. Women  In Focus is committed to the process of  dealing with issues of all types through  art.  We encourage you to continue to take  part in "that process.  The day that Women In Focus stops facilitating this exploration of issues, so  essential to the realization of a culture  defined equally by women and men, is the  day that we will no longer be a safe,  contributing organization.  The Board of Women In Focus  Women who rape  Response to responses  Kinesis:  We are responding to the four letters that  appeared in the December/January issue of  Kinesis  criticizing your articles about  women who rape. We are appalled at the lack  of support for the women who courageously  voiced their woman-rape experiences. We  are particularly concerned with WAVAW's  and Rape Relief's tone of dismissal. While  we recognize that men mostly rape, we j|L'5?r\  think that these organizations' suggestions  that women who rape are a particular  "phenomenon" (WAVAW) or an "odd" occurence  (Rape Relief) will contribute to women  experiencing woman-rape feeling unique in  their experiences, isolated and responsible for the violence directed at them.  Minimizing the experiences of these raped  women suggests an inability to recognize  and support experiences that do not fit  easily into an ideology of women's oppression by men.  WAVAW and Rape Relief both use the  less powerful words "sexual assault" and  "assault" to describe rape by other women,  thus implying there is less trauma for  the victim, and that the experience is not  as serious as rape by a man. These attitudes might prevent women who have been  raped by women from using these organizations as support systems.  We feel that it is important to recognize  the horrifying effects of patriarchal  oppression as well as the internalization  of that oppression which is sometimes manifested in acts of physical and sexual  violence towards other women. Sadly, women  do betray and rape other women. Unless  this recognition is achieved and analysis around it developed, we cannot begin  to free ourselves from the internalization of our oppression. We cannot give in  to our justified fears that the straight  media will use articles like "Women Who  Rape" to feed their homophobia and misogyny  at the expense of women's need to publicly  voice their painful experiences and in so  doing, speak to and help women who have  been, or are, in similar situations.  We are also dismayed by some of the  statements made in the letters titled  "Biased" and "Unfair." The suggestion  that Kinesis  should have talked to the  acccused women is simply ludicrous.  When it is men who rape, have we, as feminists, ever been interested in their  side of the story? Furthermore, it is  fundamental to supporting women who have  been raped that we believe their experiences. As well, it is false to believe  that a victim wields power over her  abuser, and frightening to think that the  accuser, once accused, is really the  victim, as Margo Hennigar states. We have  encountered these attitudes from men in  their hostility and defensiveness about  rape so it is particularly horrifying to  hear them voiced by a woman.  In conclusion, we think that the headline  entitled, "When Will the Community Be  Safe?" might now be more aptly titled,  "When Will the Community be Listening?"  Rachael Langford  Janette Lush  Dangerous at worst  Kinesis:  I write to express concern and disappointment at the feature article by Kim  Irving in your November issue. At best the •  feature is ill-conceived and poorly executed; at worst it is dangerous.  Problems begin with the headline: "Women  Who Rape". Intentionally or not, the use  of the word "rape" serves to both sensationalize and obfuscate the issues this  feature seeks to address. That it appears  on the front page further adds to the air  of sensationalism, particularly within  the unfortunate context of a red background  and other article titles: "Military Wives",  "Karate", "The Heat is On: Women, Sex and  Art". It's the sort of thing the tabs do  deliberately; in the case of Kinesis  one  must assume carelessness.  This kind of inattentiveness, perhaps  sloppy thinking, is evidenced in the  article itself. At no point does Irving  even attempt to explain or justify her  •use of the word "rape". It is simply  assumed that the feminist analysis and  understanding of rape—of what men do  to women—can be automatically transposed  and applied to the actions of women. It  can't be. Yes, the actions Irving describes do happen and yes, we need to  talk about them but not within the framework of rape.  Irving goes on to apply the term indiscriminately and to treat a range of  disparate issues as if they were of  a piece. Sexual abuse of children, sexual  manipulation and intimidation of women,  sexual assault of women, and the ringer,  sexual assault of men by women, are not  the same thing. They are distinct phenomena and must be treated as such. To  discuss them all in one article, sometimes  in one paragraph, serves only to confuse.  The waters are further muddied by Irving's  failure to distinguish among traditional  (i.e. male) psychologic theory, feminist  criticism of such theory, and feminist  analysis of the issues themselves.  As a community we need to begin to talk  about, think about, these issues. We need  to do so carefully, respectfully and, most  importantly, clearly. Irving hasn't done  this and by her sloppiness has made it  that much more difficult to begin a real  discussion toward the development of some  understanding. In so doing she and the  editors of Kinesis  have done us all a  disservice. We deserve better.  Lisa S. Price Kinesis February 1986   29  LETTERS  Brave and important  A few remarks on the discussion on sexual violence against women by women.  For a start, I do think it was brave and  important to broach this very difficult  topic. As much as I disliked the subheading "When will the Community be safe?"  I believe that part of the answer to this  question is when we all learn more about  being truthful. These articles were, in  part, an attempt to start being truthful  about something which is very painful.  I-often hear women excuse themselves  from saying what they really think because  it is "not safe." I think it works the  other way around, that we will only be  safe when we are truthful. In this case  that means taking what these women have  had the courage to tell us about their  experiences as true, as raising an issue  which we have to face.  This leads to the next question. Is calling the experiences described by the  two women "rape" likely to help to clarify our understanding about what goes on  when women are sexually violent to/  exploitive of other women? I don't think  so. My understanding of rape is that it  is something more than unwanted sexual  contact; that it is a political act which  expresses and reinforces the subordination  of women (and children) by men.  It is  something which men see as their right to  do to women and children, and they have  behind them a whole system of mythological,  ideological, and political enforcement that  grants its permission and gives its encouragement. The same cannot be said of women.  I do not wish to suggest that women have  some kind of biologically provided moral  purity or that they are not cruel or  exploitative. Clearly, sometimes they/we  are. My underdeveloped understanding of  these actions leads me to think that as  we are all tainted by the sexist society  in which we survive, all of us internalize  and some of us externalize that sexism,  acting out things which are the behaviour  patterns of our oppressors. I see sexual  abuse of women and children by women,  "sado-masochism," and "women's" pornography  as examples of this.  Lastly, it seems that part of the damage  done by these women, and part of why it  is so difficult to talk about all this,  is because of that sense of betrayal of  trust by mothers, or therapists, or  women in our community. It is a division  among those whom we as feminists call  "ourselves," and therefore the political  understanding we have developed in  response to male violence cannot simply  be transferred to women who commit similar acts. So we can't just use old analysis, we have to develop a new one—more  hard work.  In my view, Kim's first article failed  to do that, but her second article provided a useful start. I'm pleased that  the collective has changed its mind about  November's cover—I too thought it was  offensive and sensationalist.  Megan Ellis  Feminist double-think  Kinesis:  My first reaction to the headline "Women  Who Rape" was one of apprehension and a  feeling that perhaps it was a mistake to  emphasize such a thing. After reading  the articles, however, my feeling  changed to one of admiration for your  courage. I thought it important that  these accounts be printed, not because  I'm eager to see women regarded as sex  criminals, but because I believe that  the victims need to be vindicated.  However, the whole controversy raises  some interesting questions about double-think within the feminist community. I imagine that the experience of rape feels the same to the  victim regardless of the' sex of the  aggressor. I also imagine that the  intent on the part of the aggressor  to degrade and humiliate is the same  regardless of sex. Yet we are being  asked to apply a different set of rules  when the alleged rapist is female I If  a woman accuses a man of rape we are,  I gather, supposed to believe her  without question. Yet when the accused  is a woman we are supposed to check  the story out very carefully and  listen to both sides. When a woman  accuses a man Qf rape the definition  of "rape" is quite broad. But when the  "rapist" is a woman we talk about the  - difference between "rape" and a  "manipulative relationship," we talk  about "responsibility for our part in  our role as victim."  I am also troubled, however, by the  statement in Kinesis'  rebuttal "there  is a fundamental tenet in feminist  theory and analysis about sexual  abuse which holds that women do not  lie about their experience of sexual  assault."  I find such dogmas an affront to my  intelligence (never mind the basic  democratic  tenet that a person is  innocent until proven guilty). Maybe  90% of women, or 99%, or 99.9% don't  lie about sexual assault. But don't try  to make me believe that it is not  possible for a woman to lie about it!  To take the position that women never  lie about rape is about as stupid as  taking the position that rape is always  the woman's fault!  I deeply resent the ideaJ that if you *  want to feel you "belong" to a group  such as the women's movement there is  a certain point at which you are asked  to suspend rational judgment and accept  a dogma unquestioningly. It thus becomes  almost impossible for an intelligent  person to "belong" and still retain her  own integrity.  I resent too the way that people (in  both straight society and within  "alternative" movements rush to defend  those they see as part of their own  little in-group. "One of us  would never  do that!"  they say in defence of the  respected teacher, preacher, or businessman who is accused of molesting a  child—or  defence of _the respected  lesbian who is accused of sexual agression against young women.  Any movement (or any individual, or any  nation, for that matter) that does not  deal with internal faults, that tries  to pretend they don't exist, is likely  to be weakened and corrupted by its  very blindness. I'm sure we can readily  see examples of this all around us. Let's  not blind ourselves to examples within  the women's movement!  Anne Miles  Ed.  note: Letter edited for  All education  is political  Kinesis:  This letter was sparked by a section in  Zoe Lambert's article on ageism in the  Dec./Jan. issue. However, the point I  want to discuss is much broader. The  section of Lambert's article I want to  address is that of a description of a  lecture given by Mary Daly at Carleton  University. She criticized the lack of  discussion of specific action by the  speaker and the audience. The sentiment  expressed here aroused a concern I have  had for quite some time about education  and/or intellectualism and how many  people in the feminist community, or  in the progressive movement (I use that  term for lack of any better one) in  general, view it.  I am a student at UBC. I plan to be a  graduate student and hopefully an academic forever. My field of study is  theoretical linguistics. This particular  discipline is not and never will be  directly relevant to feminism or sociopolitical concerns. I am also politically  active (I participate in an anarchist  group and the Latin American Solidarity  Committee on campus). Linguistics has  nothing directly to do with my politics  but it has everything indirectly to do  with it because education in any form  affects other aspects of one's life.  I am a strong opponent of "functional"  education as being the only viable form  of education. "Functional" education  is "no frills" education; it consists of  training individuals for specific trades  or jobs and nothing more. This is, of  course, the opposite of broader education  which deals with, among other things,  philosophy, art, and all the pursuits  which give one general skills to apply  to all aspects of life because they give  one a profound knowledge of human beings,  their thoughts and culture, past and  present. Many of the progressive elements  in B.C. have shown agreement on this  matter in their opposition to the Socreds'  "functional" education plans.  I must include an aside here that the  present education system  is not something  I am idealizing. In particular its traditional censorship of the role of women  in society is an aspect of it I abhor. I  am speaking here of education, or learning,  in general.  Now to get back to Lambert's comment.  As far as I can tell Mary Daly is a philosopher. It is not necessarily hers, nor  any other philosopher's "duty" to translate their thoughts into a blueprint for  action. As far as I'm concerned, intellectualism—thinking, researching, discovering—is a pursuit usable in itself, if  its results are not materially tangible,  then those who.want them to be have little  understanding of this process. Creating a  blueprint is another job.  I believe that all forms of learning are  applicable to "real life" because knowledge changes one as an individual and  it influences our actions by influencing  our thoughts. All education is then, in  effect, political. But it is not always  directly political. My pursuit of  linguistics will not help feed the food  bank. I have no intention of downplaying  the importance of "bread and butter"  issues and action (I concern myself with  these in my spare time) but I ask for  equal respect for my chosen full-time  vocation. Any contribution to the understanding of human beings should be regarded not as decadent middle-class parlour  games but as significant knowledge which  may eventually influence the political.  If we don't believe this then we are  envisioning a future society just as  limited as the present, only in a different way.
