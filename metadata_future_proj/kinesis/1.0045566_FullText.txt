'tis  the day of the almighty federal budget...  What we heard so far. UI benefit rates go  down from 57 to 55 percent, but goes up to  60 percent for people of "modest income"  and people supporting a dependant... Meanwhile transfer payments to provinces to support social security expenses will go up  "modest"ly... And, to encourage people to  make charitable donations, the threshold for  tax benefits goes down to $200 from $250.  Which leads us to funding for "special interest groups:" the feds plan to "review" funding (by the way, women are in the "special  interest" category) and to encourage "reliance on other sources of funding." They'll  send us letters of their intentions so we won't  be surprised by the 1995 budget which will  tell more. Also, foreign aid has been cut by 2  percent. Overall, apparently "for every dollar raised in revenues, $5 has been cut from  spending." We'll have more in the next issue.  By the way, rumour has it that funding  for BC women's centres recieving monies  from BC's Ministry of Women's Equality is  secure for another year.  Also in BC, there were protests by women's, anti-poverty, and other socio-political  organizations on February 23, the day everyone had to line up to collect their welfare  cheques so the government could put face-  to-cheque and cut down on "welfare fraud."  This came to us compliments the NDP government. More next issue.  It's winter, the weather is bad everwhere  but in southern BC (don't hate us for it. It's  wet and damp when the sun's not shining!)  so lots of women from all over the country  are in Vancouver right now. Ex-NAC-prez  Judy Rebick's one (she's moved from Toronto to Regina, Saskatchewan to teach in  the PoliSci department at the University of  Regina); Sunera Thobani, current NAC prez  is also in town; she gave a presentation on  South Africa (she was there on a pre-pre-  election trip last November); and so is  Himani Bannerjee, most recently editor of  Returning the Gaze; Essays on Racism, Feminism and Politics. Hope it doesn't snow.  Meanwhile, the first multi-racial elections are coming up in South Africa... chances  are Kinesis'Tatima Jaffer may be ona special  NAC team that's going to South africa for  the elections.

We'll have  more on Healthsharing next month...as well,  we're going to take an analytic look at what's  happening to alternative women's publications/groups in Canada and  globally.. Pandora, the Halifax-based feminist newspaper, hasn't been able to publish  in months (but are still very much alive);  Aquelarre, the Latina women's publication  out of Vancouver, hasn't published due to  no money for almost eight months (we just  heard they may able to publish their next  issue before the end of this year alter all);  DisAbled Women's Network of Canada  (DAWN) was forced to close its doors last  year as was Press Gang Printers, the only  feminist-owned press in North America. In  England, we saw the demise of the publication Spare Rib, and later, Sisterwrite the  bookstore (and its cafe, SisterBite).  It's not all bad news.. .March is here and  lots of celebration is on... the new South Asian  Women's Centre opens up this month [see  page 3], the Philippine Women's Centre gets  bigger [see page 5]...and there are lots of  things happening for International Women's Day [see IWD Calander]...

MARCH 1994 m^^^m^^m^ww^M^^'^^^■■-•:•' *&&&:&:<  News  Murders of First Nations women:  Gathering to mourn  by Larissa Lai  On Monda y, February 14, over 150 women  and a number of men gathered at the Carnegie  Centre in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside to  march in mourning for the women who have  been murdered in the neighbourhood. Most of  those present live or spend time in the area',  and some of them were women whose family  members have been murdered there. Anumber  of First Nations students from Langara College were also in attendance.  "You must  acknowledge  the past  so that the spirits  can carry on."  -Vivien Sandy  wn>iw»>i>f»ftiiinii*r  The march followed a route through Main  Street, Alexander, Gore, Princess, Powell, an  alley between Hastings and Powell behind the  Astoria Hotel, and Hastings. It ended at  Oppenheimer Park. Along the route, the death  sites of four women were visited and blessed  with a prayer and a smudge ceremony in  which sage was burnt in a traditional act of  healing. Elder Mary Uslick from the Shuswap  Nation opened the march with a prayer, and  spoke again at the close.  "Fifty women have been killed in the  Downtown Eastside in the last ten years," says  Vivian Sandy, one of the organizers. "The  majority of those murders have not been solved.  Most of the women killed were Native. The  police tick these deaths off as not important."  For the third year in a row, women of the  Downtown Eastside organized this march to  commemorate the deaths of loved ones—sisters, aunts, daughters, and friends. The march  was supported by DERA, The Downtown  Eastside Women's Centre and the Carnegie  Centre.  "The primary reason for this march," says  Sandy, "is to help the families and friends of  the women killed, to mourn and to acknowl  edge. You must acknowledge the past so that  the spirits [of the dead women] can carry on.  When we do these things, it isn't so hard on  the people." She adds that acknowledgement  is an important part of the healing process for  those who remain living.  It is also important for the mainstream to  understand that these women are not disposable. "I had wanted to march in the West  Side," says Sandy, " to get information to the  women who get into politics. But the women  of the Downtown Eastside wanted to mourn  in their own neighbourhood. " A concurrent  rally was held in front of the Vancouver Art  Gallery on Robson Street.  The sky was gray, as though it too werein  mourning, as we marched to the first death  site, a dead-end street with a chainlink fence  closing it off and large orange ice crates piled  up to one side. A woman had been killed there  the night before the march. Police had not yet  even released her name. Several women knelt  over the site to say a prayer and burn sage as  the rest of us stood at a respectful distance,  watching. Rainwater trickled through the  gravel on the spot where she had lain.  The next three death sites we visited were  a black steel garbage dumpster to the side of  an alley, a dark doorway between a Filipino  restaurant and a coin-operated laundry, and  the alley outside the back door of the Astoria  Hotel on Hastings Street.  The mood of the marchers, enhanced by  the light rain, was sombre and contemplative.  "We were not agressive or belligerent, we  were in mourning," says Sandy.  "It is important to focus on the First Nations women killed as women of the First  Nations, not as sex trade workers, alchoholics  or addicts, " Sandy says. "There are a lot of  Native women down on skid row because  they are non-status and can't go back to the  reserves. They turn to alchohol and drugs as a  way to forget the abuse they endured in the  boarding schools."  At the end of the march, we gathered  under the covered area attached to a small  building on the Powell Street side of  Oppenheimer Park. The men served the  women a lunch of hot soup, bannock and  coffee. Once everyone had something hot in  their hands, the men were acknowledged for  their support, both with the lunch and the rest  of the march. "That's how to go back to the old  tradition," Sandy tells me. "When students  and young people see we're practising, they  continue to want to learn."

The Vancouver  Newspaper Guild  Local 115  301 - 828 W 8th Ave.  Vancouver, BC  V5Z1E2  Phone: 874-0550  Jan O'Brien,  Administrative Officer  Taking back the Downtown Eastside  South Asian Women's Centre:  New centre  opens  by Fatima Jaffer  After years of lobbying, countless  womanhours, and some serious  fundraising, South Asian women in British  Columbia finally have a space to call their  own.  The South Asian Women's Centre,  which opens its doors in Vancouver on  March 12, is the first centre west of Ontario  to target its resources and services specifically to South Asian women. Until now,  there were two centres for South Asian  women operating in Canada-one in Toronto, the other in Montreal.  "The South Asian community in Vancouver is one of the oldest in Canada. This  centre is a long-overdue opportunity for  us," says Manisha Singh, a founding member of the centre and of the South Asian  Women's Action Network (SAWAN).  SAW AN, a coalition of South Asian  women, has spent the last two years raising  funds and lobbying for the centre. It was  founded in 1991 by a few women working  for social change in women's and other  progressive organizations. SAW AN is particularly known in Vancouver for its chal-  lengeof sex selection services being targetted  at the South Asian community in Vancouver by a US doctor, and for its questioning  of the conduct of the Royal Commission on  New Reproductive Technologies, which  recently released its report.  Singh says SAW AN identified "a gap  in existing services provided by governmental and non-governmental organizations in BC. There has always been a real  need for a space for South Aswn women to  come together, meet, support each other,  share resources and devise strategies on  how we can affect real change."  Consequently, says Singh, members  of SAWAN took on as their primary goal  the securing of funding for a centre. In  order to qualify for provincial funding in  BC, women's centres have to meet certain  criteria, including membership in the BC  and Yukon Association of Women's Centres (BC&Y). Last year, SAWAN was o^r  of seven new members of the BC&Y to  receive $37,500 in core funding from the  Ministry of Women's Equality, subject to  annual review. SAWAN also received  $18,000 in start-up monies to purchase  furniture and equipment for the centre,  and to facilitate its opening.  The centre will provide a space where  South Asian women can phone or drop in  for support, counselling, or information  on a number of areas ranging from male  violence, employment, health, community services, and advocacy.  "It will be more than a resource and  referral centre," says Tina Bains, hired last  month as the Centre's Coordinator. "It's a  space for and by South Asian women,  dealing with needs identified by South  Asian women that are not being met elsewhere. And who best knows our issues  but ourselves."  Bains adds that, "in some ways, it's  basically going to be a haven for women  to just walk in and feel free, and find some  respite from their troubled lives."  For now, Bains is the only paid staff  member at the centre and services will  largely be provided by volunteers. A Centre Committee, made up of SAWAN members, will oversee the operation of the  centre for the first two years and a volunteer Board of Directors, made up of South  Asian women active in the three other  South Asian women's groups in Vancou-  see SOUTH ASIAN on page 10 News  Women take on BC police force:  Oppal Report delayed  by Shannon e. Ash   The release of a report examining policing in British Columbia has been delayed  until May 31. The report of the Oppal Commission, which was established in 1992, was  originally to be released on December 31;  1993. Cathy Stooshnov of the Commission  says the delay is due to the large number of  submissions received—a total of 900—which  had to be processed along with the Commission's own research. The Commission held  56 days of hearings from December 1992 to  June 1993.  Numerous women's groups made submissions to the Commission [see Kinesis,  June 1993]. Bonnie Agnew of Vancouver  Rape Relief and Women's Shelter (Rape Re-  Women and prisons:  lief) says she is "surprised and disappointed"  at the report's delay.  Agnew points out that there is a lot of  restructuring going on right now in the Attorney-General's office and police departments, so the report's recommendations  could be useful now, and may not have as  much impact when released later.  Public debate about community policing is needed as soon as possible and she  hopes money willbeallocated for this. Agnew  says the issues Rape Relief raised in its presentation to theCommission, including problems sexual assault support workers have  had in working with the police, have for the  most part continued. There has been a small  improvement in that more police officers  have been allocated to the sexual assault  Balaclava  to stay open  unit—by reassignment rather than by hiring  more officers, which Rape Relief opposed in  its brief.  Karen Spears of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside Women's Centre (DEWC) says  it's hard to know what the effects of the  delay are without knowing the contents of  the report. Two of the issues the DEWC had  brought to the Commission concerned treatment of women who are sexually assaulted  and the issue of stolen or lost welfare cheques.  Spears says that in regard to the first  issue, one change has occurred—the police  have dropped the general release form,  which a woman reporting sexual assault  had to sign if she wanted charges pursued.  The form, which was criticized by many  women's groups, allowed police access to  any information about the woman from any  person or source, with no avenue of redress  on her part. A medical release form is still  used. However, Spears says it is still difficult  for women to report sexualassault,duetoan  attitude problem on the part of the police.  She believes it is unlikely the Oppal Commission could make recommendations that  would have a major impact on police attitudes.  DEWC's other major cpncern is lost or  stolen welfare cheques. If a woman reports a  cheque lost or stolen, she is likely to have to  deal with contempt from the police, who  assume it is a scam. The situation has worsened as procedural difficulties have been  added. The Ministry of Social Services (MSS),  by Agnes Huang  The only half-way house for federally-  sentenced women west of Ontario will not  be shut down.  On January 27, the Board of the Eliza-  bethFrySociety of Greater Vancouver (EFry)  decided to keep the Balaclava Residence  open, even though it is projecting a substantial budget deficit for the 1994-1995 fiscal  year.  EFry, which has operated the Balaclava  Residence since 1976, had announced in December that continued federal funding cuts  to the half-way house were forcing them to  close Balaclava [see Kinesis Feb./94[.  The federal government has continually chipped away EFry's funding for providing services to federally sentenced women  on day and full parole. This, despite the fact  that in 1990, following recommendations by  the Task Force on Federally Sentenced  Women, the federal government announced  it would close down P4W (Prison for  Women), the federal prison for women in  Kingston, set up five regional correctional  centres and increase the number of half-way  houses for women. The government promised to spend over $50 million for the projects  over the next four years. However, EFry has  seenitsfundingfortheoperationof Balaclava  Residence drop by 42 percent over the past  two years.  Following EFry's announcement it  would close Balaclava, the BC provincial  government chipped in some more money,  cutting the deficit projection, but not eliminating it. The federal government offered  nothing, and continued with its funding  cuts. EFry has projected they will enter the  coming fiscal year with a deficit of $89,000.  "Nonetheless, the Board, staff and volunteers of [EFry] feel strongly about continuing our historical commitment to support the needs of women in conflict with the  law," says Rosemary Cryer, president of the  Board of EFry. "We believe it is essential to  continue to provide women with this choice."  Women working at Balaclava say that  staying at Balaclava is the only way for some  women to get parole. "There are certain  women who wouldn't be getting day parole  except a t the Open Living Unit a t the Burnaby  Correctional Centre for Women (BCCW) if  Balaclava were closed," says a full-time staff  member at the house.  Funding cuts to women's organizations  most often result in women workers at the  organization and volunteers having to putin  extra hours to raise the required funds, and  may also lead to a cutback in programs  offered to women, says Chris Rahim of the  Vancouver Status of Women and a member  of Joint Effort, an all- woman prisoner support group for women at BCCW. "It's not  only fundraising; it's also the programs. If  EFry has to cut its programs because of  funding cuts, its the women's service organizations that have to pick up the slack,"  says Rahim. "We just can't sit back and not  do anything. Women still need the services  whether the funding is there or not."  Maureen Gabriel, director of community and correctional programs for EFry,  says that the Society has made a commitment not to cut any of its programs or lay off  any staff in order to deal with the deficit.  Instead, the organization will increase its  fundraising efforts over the next year, and  has already set up a fundraising committee  of Board and staff members.  Corrections Services Canada (CSC) justifies cutting funding to Balaclava Residence  by saying that the house does not always  operate at full capacity (4 federally-sentenced  women at a time). CSC says it is looking to  create more "choices" for women in conflict  with the law that would allow women to  serve their parole periods in regions where  they have family and friends.  A Balaclava staff member says that creating regional options is a positive step, but  not at the expense of denying some women  the only option they may have. "[Regional  centres would be] great, but there are no  half-way houses [for federally-sentenced  women] in other regions," says the staff  member. "The federal government shouldn't  close the half-way house down until there  are other options created."  in its changes to income assistance policy  [see Kinesis, Feb/94], no longer pays replacement funds to the recipient, but pays the  landlord directly and issues a food voucher.  Police no longer give a report number to a  woman reporting a lost or stolen cheque,  unlike any other report of lost or stolen  money. There is only one police officer handling these cases, with whom welfare recipients must makeanappointment. Spears says  there is usually a delay of three to four  weeks, by which time the next cheque is out,  so some women may not go to the appointment; the police then claim it was a scam all  along.  Police have fostered the idea of welfare  fraud as a major problem, says Spears, and  the MSS is under pressure to alleviate media  attention. What has not been reported, says  Spears, is that recipients are already required  to repay the replacement money over a period of time.  As well, if a woman is assaulted when  her cheque is stolen, it is not classified as an  assaultcase,butasalost/stolen-chequecase.  This can lead to difficulties, for example  when applying for Victim Compensation.  Kinesis will report on other recommendations made by women's organizations to the  Commission and on the findings of the Commission following the release of the report.  Shannon e.

They have  moved to thebasementof a houseat 1011 East  59th Avenue.  The move was facilitated by the granting  of core funding from the BC Ministry of  Women's Equality. The standard core fund-  "MyGodl What did I get myself into?!"  ing provided by the ministry to some women's organizations who are members of the  B.C. and Yukon Association of Women's  Centres is $37,500 per year.  While the PWC only had a living room  before, the new premises includes off ice space  and a library.  The PWC has been in operation as a  collective for five years, doing advocacy work  around the concerns of Filipina domestic  workers in British Columbia. As well, they  provide awareness workshops and organize  social events for Filipina women.  The new funding has enabled the PWC  to hire two part-time staff, Anilu Claur and  Jane Ordinario. They act as program coordinators, taking care of the day-to-day operations of the centre. This is the first time the  organization has had paid staff and an office.  A number of organizations working on  the issues faced by domestic workers in Vancouver, who are are largely Filipina, are supportive of the PWC's role in the movement.  "I'm glad to see that the Philippine  Women Centre is being recognized for what  they're doing. It's important work," says  Cenen Bagon of the Vancouver Committee  for Domestic Workers and Caregivers'Rights.  "This is a positive step," says Crisanta  Sapang of the West Coast Domestic Workers  Centre. "All the help we can get is welcome in  our fight for the rights of domestic workers."  At their annual general meeting on January 12, the PWC collective selected focus  areas for 1994. These are: awareness and  consciousness raising, economics, social advocacy, support and solidarity, and networking-   Claur says that the acquisition of core  funding gives them the power to intensify  and streamline existing programs, particularly their self-awareness workshops. These  workshops, largely for Filipina domestic  workers, concentrate on encouraging the development of an analysis around their identities in a Canadian context—as women, as  Filipina, as women of colour, and as migrant  workers. The workshops provide historical  awareness, particularly concerning the eco-  ■£ nomically exploitative relationship between  o the Philippines and countries like Canada,  | and how this relates to the mass exodus of  ^ women from the Philippines to do jobs that  g most Canadian women do not want.  & The PWC is starting a facilitators' train-  xi   ing program scheduled to beginin April. The  >. program will train women to giveawareness  ■c   workshops in their own communities.  g They will continue with their regular  ■2   social gatherings to give Filipina women a  a. chance to meet each other. On February 12,  there was a gathering to introduce women to  the new centre.  Having regular staff in place makes it  possible for the organization to get involved  in important areas it did not have the resources for before. For instance, they will be  sending delegates to an upcoming conference organized by the Ministry of Women's  Equality under the ministry's Stopping the  Violence initiative. The conference will focus  on issues of violence against ethnic and visible minority women. The PWC is also involved with the feminist networking group  organized by the Vancouver Status of  Women. As well, they are working on a five-  part series on Women and Poverty with End  Legislated Poverty (ELP) for Vancouver's  community radio station, Co-op Radio. It  will deal with classism, organizing, consumerism, and global economic restructuring.  Two members of the Philippine Women  Centre, Cecilia Diocson and Mable Elmore,  are currently in the Philippines networking  with local women's organizations in order to  strengthen international linkages. In Manila,  they will be visiting the Centre for Women's  Researchand Gabriela, thenational umbrella  organization for women's groups in the Philippines. They will be consulting with  Samakana, an organization for the women's  urban poor movement. In Cordilleria, a  mountainous region in the north, they will  visit the Cordilleria People's Alliance, which  is an indigenous people's group. The two  women will be back by the end of February,  and hopefully will have slides to show at the  PWC's event for International Women's Day  on March 6.

CLAYOQUOT PROTEST  Raging Grannies sang in support of Clayoquot Sound protestors in  Vancouver February 10th. About 150 people gathered outside the provincial courthouse at noon to rally in support of international arrestees who  were on trial. They were arrested for blocking a logging road into the old  growth forest of Clayoquot Sound, in protest of the BC government's  decision to allow clearcut logging there. The Grannies, who specialize in  setting new topical words to old tunes, have sung in support of many  causes, including anti-NAFTA protests.  Transition nous* in Nanaimo:  Haven House  by Anita Fast  Transition house workers in Nanaimo  who have been in negotiations for a first  contract since last April will not have to  strike after all. Wages have been increased  at Haven House, a Vancouver Island transition house in Nanaimo, bringing an end  to negotiations for wage parity [see Kinesis,  Dec/Jan 94.]  After joining tthe Health Sciences Association (HSA) union inFebruary last year,  the transition house workers have been in  negotiations for a first contract since April  16 last year.After the transition house's  board failed to adjust wages to meet acceptable standards, women workers voted 93  percent in favor of strike action on September 9 if the government did not live up to  their promises of wage parity and pay equity.  Fortunately, job action was not necessary. On December 24, a collective agreement was achieved. The agreement was  ratified in early January when Board members and workers voted to accept the proposed agreement. Wages have been increased to $12.50—$15 per hour for transition house workers, and $11 -$15 for child  care workers. Wages were previously $6.30-  $14 per hour.  The new wage scale will also apply  retroactively to wages from April 1, 1993.  However, while the new wage rate is currently being applied to paychecks, the retroactive wages, to be given in one lump sum,  have not yet been paid.  Maryann Abbs-Fehler, the labour relations officer responsible for Haven House,  notes that only part of the money for the  wage increases came from the "wage parity  fund," a fund set up specifically for cases  like this by the provincial government. "There  was not enough money in it (wage parity  fund) to even the wages," said Abbs-Fehler.  "Other funds were given from the Ministry  of Social Services."  The collective agreement is up on March  31, but it is unlikely that similar problems  will arise for a second contract. "The first  collective agreement is always the most difficult," says Abbs-Fehler. "I don't foresee  problems with continuing the agreement,  but it depends on how much money is procured from the government."  AlthoughHavenHouse workers fought  for a rate of pay higher than that achieved in  the first contract, "everyone seems satisfied," comments Abbs-Fehler. "No one ever  gets everything they want. For example,  there is still no pension plan, which would  be something to go for in the future."  imiiiiMiiiiMi  San gam Grant R.P.C.

The Korean Women's Associations  United, a coalition of women's organizations, spearheaded the drafting of the Act.  KWAU published a series of booklets, organized rallies, and collected and submitted  campaign signatures for its enactment. The  draft was prepared by lawyers, scholars,  and other women activists, and demands a  change in the definition of sexual violence,  currently defined in Korean law as "violence  againstwomen's purity," to "violenceagainst  women's self-determination".  The Alliance for the Special Sexual Violence Act demands all physical and psychological sexual harassment be included in the  definition of violence, not only rape and  actual physical violence. Further, it should  specify obscene sexist language, insinuations and exposure of genitals, and incest  and child molestation.  Korean women are also demanding the  recognition of date rape, marital rape, and  stranger rape, with their distinct characteristics and appropriate punishment.  Legal Status of  Lesbians  A booklet on the Legal Status of Lesbians, by the Victoria Status of Women Action  Group, has been revised to reflect the new  protections provided by recent court decisions and changes in legislation.

It also  describes ways that lesbians can protect  themselves and their relationships, and provides a list of other resources to contact.  The booklet costs $2 per copy.

International Women  of Colour Exchange  International Women of Colour  Exhange, organized by a group of women of  colour living in Berlin, took place August 29  through September 13,1992.  The first International Women's Exchange between Germany and the US for  women of colour took place in Germany in  1990, when the focus was racism and anti-  semitism.PreviousExchanges involved only  white women. In 1990, it was decided that  future gatherings would be only for women  of colour.  In 1991, the Exchange took place in San  Francisco. In 1992, the Exchange in Berlin  included not only women of colour from  Germany and the US, but from London and  Amsterdam as well.  The Exchange was not a formal conference, but rather a community based meeting  of International Women of Colour in a more  personalized manner. Issues discussed included: internalized racism; racism/anti-  semitism and neo-facism in the countries we  live in; our own forms of resistence as women  of colour; the politics of coalition building;  the life and' survival of non-European cultures in spite of 500 years of colonization and  how we are able to live our different cultures  in a white-dominated world; how we are  creating a lesbian of colour culture.

Preparing for Beijing  Here's an update on what's happening  worldwide as (some) women prepare for  the Fourth World Conference on Women to  be held in Beijing, China, September 4-15;  1995.  The NGO Forum, which is held concurrent to the Conference, takes place August  30-September 8,1995, in Beijing, China and  is open to all non-governmental organizations. The NGO Forum is the place where  grassroots activists from around the world  gather to share strategies, discuss ideas and  politics, and network. The Conference itself  is largely attended by governmental representatives.  More than 10,000 representatives of organizations from 170 countries are expected  to participate in the conference. It is expected to be larger than the previous world  conferences on women held in Mexico City  (1975), Copenhagen (1980), and Nairobi  (1985).  An outline of the vision and strategy for  the Beijing Conference was given by Gertrude  Mongella, the Secretary General of the 1995  Fourth World Conference on Women at the  Sixth International Forum of the Association  of Women in Development in Washington,  DC last October.  According to Mongella, the first task for  conference delegates will be an evaluation of  the achievements of women in the ten years  following the 1985 World Conference to  "Review and Appraise the Achievements of  the United Nations Decade for Women in  Nairobi, Kenya."  Second on the agenda is the adoption of  a Platform for Action. This document, according to Mongella, will provide concise,  action-oriented guidelines for addressing the  four or five most fundamental obstacles to  the advancement of the majority of women.  Preparatory meetings will begin on a  national level in 1994 as each region of the  world convenes a regional meeting [see list  below.]  Mongella also stressed the need for  strong participation by non-governmental  organizations, adding that the regional and  global NGOForums provide ''another venue  for the women of the world to network."  Events leading upto the Conference  On January 10-14, a Special Session on  the Commission on the Status of Women  was held in New York.  On March 3-4, the international NGO  consultation for the 4th World Conference  on Women, called "Changing Forms in a  Changing World," takes place at the United  Nations in New York City. This consultation  is intended to update NGOs on plans for the  1995 World Conference on Women, including regional activities, and to allow NGOs to  haveopportunities to work together on strategies, programmes and action for 1995.

' r. *  WAPPV  IWD  SISTERS  PSACSURHEY  tx&mm LOCAL What's News  by Lissa Geller  MISAC  A sexual assault centre in Nanaimo, BC,  has been denied continued funding following an investigation of the centre's operations  by the Ministry of the Attorney General.  The Mid-Island Sexual Assault Centre  (MISAC) was informed it would be denied  renewal of its Victim Assistance Program  (VAP) contract worth $66,600 by the Attorney General because the ministry's "emergency investigation" had raised concerns  about the services the centre provides.  Centre Coordinator, Tina Hurd, says the  government's decision threatens the existence of the centre. "The government's behaviour suggests a systematic dismantling of  grassroots organizations in an attempt to  take choice away from women," she wrote in  a recent press release to Kinesis.  The investigation was launched in July  1992 after complaints were lodged against  the centre with a local MLA by some of its  employees and volunteers. MISAC board  members say the investigation is seriously  flawed because the Ministry refused to provide any information to the Centre on the  complaints or on its investigation.  The Centre's Board of Directors then  complained to the provincial Ombudsman  about the lack of information from the Ministry, and the Ombudsman requested a formal independent inquiry into the actions of  the government and the complaints against  the centre. A staffperson at the Centre also  lodged a private complaint against the Ministry with the Ombudsman and, since that  time, the Ministry has refused to communicate with the Centre.  JUSTICE  IiNSTmjTE  0FB.G  Justice Institute of B.C.  Interdisciplinary Studies  extends greetings  to B.C. women  on the occasion of  International Women's Day  Interdisciplinary Studies offers  continuing professional  education and training programs  in the following areas:  • Child and Youth Care Issues  • Child Sexual Abuse  • Conflict Resolution/Mediation  • Counselling (Family  Issues/Trauma and Post-  Traumatic Stress)  • Management and  Administrative/Support Staff  Skills  • Residential Care  (Management Skills/Frontline  Skills)  • Training for Trainers  For a complete calendar of  courses, phone:  (604) 222-7224  The Centre's board members says the  government is refusing to cooperate with  an independent investigation and that the  review remains incomplete at this time.  In a letter to the Attorney General's  Office, MISAC chair, Leonie Keltie, says the  Ministry has also released information of  serious allegations against the centre to the  media before the centre has had a chance to  respond to the investigation.  Keltie says the Ministry's lack of cooperation is part of its larger agenda. "We  know what's happening. We are extremely  disappointed in the government's lack of  accountability in dealing with the Centre  over the last two years. We are horrified  and outraged that the Ministry of Attorney  General who is responsible for justice is  able to conduct its affairs in a manner so  high-handed, unfair and secretive."  Hurd says MISAC believes this attack  was predetermined several years ago. "The  Centre has been in existence since 1976, and  in 1987, the Centre was funded under a  Sexual Assault Centre Contract. This was  changed to a Victim's Assistance Contract  in 1988. This changing of the contract has  set the Centre up to be duplicated by other  Victim's Assistance Programs in the community." Hurd says the contract may now  be given to an organization which may not  be progressive and feminist.  Nanaimo newspapers report that the  Ministry has decided to give the contract to  another unnamed organization inNanaimo  as of March this year.  Some clients at the centre have voiced  their anger in local media at the government's random power to launch investigations and eliminate contracts without any  accountability.  "Issues of accountability regarding the  Centre's contract has been dependent on  the government's idea of what service delivery is versus the needs of the survivors  who use the service," says a member of the  Centre and an abuse-survivor.  To date, the Ministry has refused to  communicate with the Centre or cooperate  with the independent investigation. The  Centre is not sure whether it has the funds  to operate without the Ministry contract.  For more information at this time, contact Tina Hurd at (604) 753-4723. Kinesis will  carry more details in the next issue.

South Africa currently has anti-sodomy  laws which the gay rights group Equality  Foundation intends to challenge as unconstitutional as soon as the new constitution is  ratified.  Woman heads  Broadcasting Corp.  Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri has become the  first Black South African and the first woman  to head the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), the national television station in South Africa. The corporation has  traditionally been the mouthpiece for apartheid and was controlled by white men,  mostly Afrikaners, who were members of  the right-wing Broederbond society.  Matsepe-Casaburri was most recently  the director of the Education Development  Trust and has been active in the ANC Women's League since returning from exile in  Swaziland and Namibia in 1990. She has a  doctorate degree from Rutgers University  and was instrumental in starting the Black  Women's Research Network  As the chair of the first integrated Board  of Directors for the SABC, Matsepe-  Casaburri says she hopes to 'bring a new  reality to the station. "Because the South  African media has always been controlled  by white men, it looks at things' from a white  male point of view. We must look at things  from all sides and through the eyes of all  people—women and men, young and old,  black and white, rural and urban," she said.  Feminist Radio in  Nicaragua  Nicaragua has its first and only feminist  radio station, Radio Mujer. The station  started in January as a women-centred, alternative station to provide women in Nicaragua with news and music that was specifically feminist.  Luz Monterrey, the station's director  notes that, since manyTsIicaraguan women  are illiterate, the radio is a primary source of  information. As well, "newspapers and  magazines don't reach all towns and listening to the radio is free," says Monterray,  making radio the most accessible means of  communication for women in the barrios,  markets and jails of the country and breaking down the isolation often feltby rural and  poor women.  The idea for Radio Mujer first came  aboutwhentheSandinistascameinto power.  But, says Monterrey, "like most male-dominated political parties, this group has not  always considered women's issues as an  important part of their agenda." She was  told the radio station was "not necessary for  the movement" and it was some time before  she was able to get it off the ground.  The station is planning regular features  on women's health, sex education and ecology. It also plans to make air time available  to other women's organizations to broadcast programs throughout Nicaragua.  Anti-lesbian furor in  England  Education officials in Hackney, England are attempting to discredit and harass a  head teacher in the region ftir refusing to  take students to a production of "Romeo and  Juliet."  Jane Brown, headmistress atKingsmead  School, turned down tickets to the production partly because the play was "entirely a  heterosexual love story," and because lack  of money made proper supervision of the  students impossible.  Local council officials have responded  by whipping up anti-lesbian sentiment  against her. A spokesperson for the National  Union of Teachers said that "the council is  continually issuing press statements which  reinforce the media interest and... some of  the prejudice which is now being exhibited  against Jane is because of her sexual orientation."  Despite overwhelming support from the  teachers and governors of the school and  from the organization who first offered the  play rickets to the school, Brown continues  to be vilified by local education off icials. The  National Union of Teachers (NUT) believes  this may be an attempt to discredit recent  moves by the government to place more  power in the hands of local schools and take  power away from local authorities.  "Hackney may be using the incident to  show what 'might happen' if the policy is  implemented" said a NUT spokesperson.  "If so, it demonstrates the hypocracy of an  organization whose Equal Opportunities  Policy states that it will 'create a working  environment in which...lesbians...will not  be subjected to harassment."  Japanese Women  The current economic recession in Japan has hit women jobseekers particularly  hard,saysanarticleinWomen'sNewsWatch  from Manila.  While men in Japan have a 2.22 ratio of  graduates to jobs, women have a 0.93 ratio.  This means that there are fewer jobs than  ever before for Japanese women leaving  post-secondary education.  This ratio also points to a larger problem of discrimination in the hiring policies  of Japanese companies. Despite a 1986 law  forbidding sexual discrimination inemploy-  ment, women continue to be employed only  to make up for labour shortages or to "enhance a corporation's image." The fear that  women will leave to get married or have  children has meant that women continue to  be at the bottom of the employment ladder.  The treatment of women graduates during  recession demonstrates "the true corporate  attitudes towards women" says the article.  New network of Asian  women  The Caucus of Asian Women's Network recently formed to ensure that all governmental, inter-governmental and United  Nations entities recognize and respect the  role to be played by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in shaping the agenda  and plan of action for the Fourth World  Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.  The Caucus was formed after women  gathered for the Asian and Pacific Symposium of NGOs on Women in Development  last November by the following organizations: the Asian-South Pacific Bureau of  Adult Education; Asian Women Human  Rights Council; Isis International-Manila;  Women's International League for Peace and  Freedom—Philippines; Asian Indigenous  Women's Network; Coalition Against Traffic in Women—Asia; and the Southeast Asia  Women's Information Network.  TheCaucus made someimportantgains  at the Symposium regarding the organizations' ability to work together. A proposal to  include the Caucus in the decision-making  process of the symposium was reached as  well as the decision to allow time for Caucus  meetings to discuss issues of concern.  Up to June 1994, the Caucus will outline  a number of events and proposed actions  that will highlight their activities and agenda.  An overall Plan of Action, which was developed at the Symposium, will serve as the  guideline to action leading up to the 1995  World Conference on Women.

Grace Hartman, 1918-1993  Grace Hartman was CUPE's  national president from 1975  to 1983 - the first woman to lead  a major national union in Canada.  Her outrage over workplace discrimination against women first  sparked her interest in unions.  That was in 1954. Grace was a  secretary on the way to being a  union activist.  Her strong stand on behalf of  women and union rights inspired  her leadership of the Ontario hospital strike in 1981. Angered by  low pay and the denial of bargaining rights to hospital workers,  mostly women, she led them out  on strike.  Her subsequent court  trial, conviction and jail term was  a price she paid to pursue her  struggle for justice and equality.  Grace Hartman's leadership  extended beyond CUPE to other  Canadian and international groups  seeking justice and peace. A  woman who never retired, she  received many awards and distinctions, including three Doctorates  of Law.  In 1992 Grace Hartman  was inducted into the Labor Hall  of Fame.  The rose and barbed wire are symbols  for the many struggles led by Grace  Hartman in the long march toward  women's equality.  More than 30,000 B.C. women  are members of the Canadian Union  of Public Employees (cupe). The  legacy of Grace Hartman lives on as  the un-organized continue to  organize and the organized continue  to press for pay and employment  equity.

Government and  Service Employees' Union Feature  Struggle in Chiapas:  Meeting in solidarity  by Jeannette Armstrong and Joan  Phillip .  On January 20, the national organization of  Indigenous Peoples of Mexico (FIPI) called for the  presence of international indigenous observersat  the talks they were convening January 21-24 to  bring resolution to the conflict in Chiapas,Mexico.  This follows the ou tbreak ofrevolu Hon in Chiapas  by indigenous andpoor people on January 1st, the  day the North American Free Trade Agreement  came into effect.  Jeannette Armstrong and Joan Phillip, both  of the Okanagan, were invited by the Indigenous  Peoples Alliance (IPA) and CONIC, the Continental Coordinating Commission of Indigenous  Peoples, North, South and Central America, to  pa rticipa te in a delega Hon of In terna tional Indigenous observers in Chiapas.  Upon their return from Chiapas, Armstrong  and Phillip wrote a report, dated January 30,  which they have submitted to Kinesis/or publication.  During our visit to Chiapas, we were  appalled at the deplorable living conditions,  the abject poverty, the absolute lack of political power that the people in Chiapas, a state  of Mexico, have had to endure over the past  500 years of colonization.  The Mexican  government gained  access to previously  communally held lands  by amending...the  Mexican Constitution.  Of the almost 90 percent of campesino  and Indian people who live in Chiapas, 70  percent are Mayan. Eighty percent of all  Mayan children suffer severe malnutrition.  The poverty level in Chiapas state is the  highest in all of Mexico. Thirty percent of the  population is totally illiterate, three times  higher than in the rest of Mexico. Forty-two  percent of the houses in Chiapas lack basic  services of electricity and water. For comparison, in the largely Mayan communities in  the conflict zone of Ocosingo, Altamirano,  and Margaritas, absolute illiteracy levels soar  to over 60 percent, while up to 80 percent of  their houses lack basic services. What is  clear is that the indigenous peoples of that  region in Chiapas have no alternative—  they are dying of starvation.  Reports of serious human rights violations are being investigated by CONPAZ,  an organized body of international nongovernmental organizations concerned with  human rights. It is interesting to note we  have seen little or no news of the fact tha t, on  January 2, Absalon Castellanos, the former  governor of Mexico, was kidnapped by 40  Zaptistas from his ranch. He was still being  The focus on land reform escala ted when  the land-holding system was changed in  1993 by the Mexican government. In Chiapas  state, there are two types of land holding  systems: the large fertile plantation/ranch  lands taken by the Spanish descendant landlords, and the poorer lands communally  held by the campesinos and Indians. The  small, communally held lands the people  manage to maintain and protect provide  their income and sustenance, where beans  and corn form the staple foods, and cash  crops such as coffee are grown. It is these  lands that have now become subject to taxa-  held along with his wife and brother when  we left on January 27th.  We witnessed what was described as  an historical event in the four-day congress  of the 280 Indian and cam pesino (land workers) organizations of Chiapas, and 120 such  organizations representing all other states  in Mexico. The four-day meeting concluded  by achieving a position of solidarity focused on land reform and an immediate  reversal and amendment of an article (27) in  the Mexican constitution, and social policy  reforms which would meet short and long  term needs to alleviate the critical conditions which gave rise to the armed uprising.  The formation of a Conserjo (council)  of Indian and campesino leaders representing these organizations will negotiate with  the government to bring about resolution.  The President and' his heads of state were  meeting with the Conserjo on January 26th  in Tuxtla Gutierrez.  Working with women to change the terms of trade  and to strengthen their participation in democratic structures.

The Mexican government gained access to  previously communally held lands by  amending Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution.  This is parallel to the Canadian government's attempt to pas_s_similar legislation in  Canada last fall, to open up communally  held reserve lands to private ownership, sale  to foreign investment, and taxation through  the First Nations Chartered Land Act. The  current Liberal government has announced  it will pursue the legislation drafted by the  Conservative government.  The end result, as we have seen in  Chiapas, is the loss of indigenous lands to  foreign interests, severe poverty conditions  for indigenous peoples, and a convenient  opening of Indigenous lands to dispossession and exploitation through the North  American Free Trade Agreement, with poverty as the driving tool.  According to the Indian Rights Committee of Chicago, Aboriginal peoples in the  United States and Canada live on traditional  lands endowed with40 percentof all known  energy resources for eachcountry. In Canada,  we have been somewhat protected. However, the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en and  Clayoquot decisions are changing that. In  Mexico,PresidentSalinasrecently abolished  even the meagre Mexican laws protecting  ancient land rights in Article 4 of the Mexican Constitution. All point toward a land  and resource grab by large multinational  corporations, through the North American  Free Trade Agreement—a genocidal dispossession of the poor and the oppressed sanctioned in the interests of "free trade" and the  privileged who benefit.  It was recently revealed that lands held  communally by the Mayan people in Chiapas  are very rich in oil reserves. Documents  recently revealed also show that testing results carried out in secret by PEMPX, a Mexican petroleum company, have been passed  on to US petroleum companies. In fact, the  Ejercito Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) attacked a PEMEX base and  removed dynamite used for the exploration  project. It was reported in the respected  Mexican weekly Prosesco that information  This is only a  foreshadowing of the  conflict and  repercussions which  will result from the loss  of control over land and  resources by the  people.  regarding the petroleum field was extracted  from a US Government Accounting Office  report and from documents exchanged by  Allan Mendelowitz and Sam Gejdenson,  negotiators for the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement.  An aspect of the NAFTA which the  EZLN (Zapatistas) oppose is that decisionmaking would come throughan "Independent NAFTA Tribunal" to protect multi-national corporate interests and access to the  people's lands and natural resources without their input or consent. Even national  laws which stand in the way of "free trade"  can be overruled by the tribunal and have no  force or effect.  The underlying issue in Chiapas is one  which is much larger than a domestic insurrection in Mexico. This is only a foreshadowing of the conflict and repercussions which  will result from the loss of control over land  and resources by the people.  The major concern expressed by the  Mayan peoples' organization COLPUMALI  and the Consejo of Campesino Peoples and  Indigenous Peoples of Mexico was that, once  the international press and human rights  delegations began to leave, the reprisals and  human rights violations would increase,  without resolving the underlying problems.  The linkages of support for human rights  organizations from around the world in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas are: The  Centre for Human Rights Fray Bartolome de  las Casas, part of the Catholic EHocese headed  by Bishop Miguel Ruiz; and CONPAZ~a  coalitionof non-governmental organizations  andhumanrightsorganizations. CONPAZ's  telephone and fax number are 967-80697.  The Indigenous Peoples Alliance will  continue to lend international presence in  Chiapas as long as necessary to ensure the  human rights of our affiliate organizations  in Mexico. To contact the IP A, call the  TON ANTTERRA coordinating of f iceat (602)  254-5230. Continuous letters, faxes and calls  to the Mexican government expressing concern are vital.  Jeannette Armstrong is currently working on  a book to be published by Theytus Books in  Penticton.

MARCH 1994 News  from SOUTH ASIAN page 3  ver and other progressive social organizations, will help shape the direction of the  centre and assist in fundraising efforts. Centre hours of operation have yet to be decided  The centre is located at 8163 Main Street  (at SE Marine Drive), an area where a large  number of members of South Asian communities live. "In Vancouver, communities  are very neighbourhood-based and we want  to be as accessible as possible to the women  who willbe using our services," says SAWAN  member Shimsher Pannun.  According to its mission statement, the  centre is a secular organization that recognizes the historical, linguistic, geographic,  and religious diversity within theSouth Asian  community, as well as a lesbian positive,  feminist, anti-racist, anti-imperialistandanti-  caste/classist space.  Singh says that, in addition, the centre is  "a place where we can build coalitions between women from different South Asian  communities, women of colour communities and First Nations women in our common struggle against racism and sexism."  The centre welcomes all First Nations  women and women of colour to use the  space and to volunteer, and membership is  open to all women.  Cynthia Low, a member of Asian Lesbians of Vancouver, says the centre's opening  is "inspiring to other women of colourgroups  and communities" and notes that nothing  equivalent to the Centre presently exists for  Chinese women in Vancouver.  "It's important to have a place where  women can go to get resources specific to  their needs, speak to someone who knows  their issues or speaks the same language,  and who is also knowledgeable about exist  ing services available in the province. This  centre is a model for women of colour communities who also need spaces that specifically meet their needs."  Suniti Khosla, a long-time Vancouver  community activist, says shejoined SAWAN  when she heard about the plans for the  centre. Khosla says she hopes the centre  provides a forum for some "active listening  and dialogue on issues ranging from abuse  to sexual orientation."  "We'realso hoping this centre willbring  together South Asian women of different  communities and different generations.  Younger women have a lot to gain from the  knowledge of older women about our history as women of South Asian descent in  Vancouver, and they also need a space where  they can share their stories of survival and  the struggle of trying to live in two worlds."  South Asian women and women of colour are invited to attend the opening of the  SAWAN centre on March 12 from 1 -5 pm. A  benefit to celebrate the new centre with the  larger feminist community will be held once  the centre is up and running. For more information, call the centre at 321-8844.

This month, we  take a look at some of what we covered in March  issues past, from 1974 to 1994.  As wewent through thearchives, lookingat  news stories, International Women's Day coverage, photographs, and graphics, we uncovered  much more "herstory" than we are able to present  at this time. Questions remain: How did Kinesis  cover events and which events? Who worked on  the paper and why? Did Kinesis reflect the community it serves or were/are we the vanguard of  what was/is happening in the movement? Whose  movement was/is it? We'll try to answer these in  a future issue. Watch for it.  March 1974  Thefour-year old Vancouver Status ofWom-  en's newsletter becomes Kinesis, the newsletter  for VSW members.

If your community was under military control, you would also have to deal with the  violence that comes with an occupying army.  The staff at the Falls Road Women Centre in West Belfast work on the same sorts of  problems faced by women everywhere. But  because West Belfast is under British military  occupation, women there also face the threat  of violence by the security forces and by  loyalist paramilitaries.  Una Marron, project co-ordinator at the  centre, says that much of their work involves  crisis counselling. In addition to counselling  around issues like violence in the home, rape  and sexual abuse, women also come to the  centre needing to talk about the aftermath of  army searches of their homes.  "It can range from dealing with the  trauma of having your home invaded and  your possessions smashed and destroyed, to  feeling a terrible sense of violation, like your  home is contaminated," says Marron. She  adds that the verbal and physical abuse the  women are subjected to by the British army  during the house searches is often sexual in  nature.  Women in West Belfast may also have to  cope with the arrest by the security forces of  one of their children. This is often a long and  exhausting process, as it can take two or three  years to get through the court system, during  which time the young person would be held  in custody.  Marron says the arrest of a son or daughter can be frightening and intimidating for  these women, in part because they are confronted with authorities they've never had to  deal with before. "We accompany women to  court and to solicitors' offices and the like, to  try and make the whole process as easy as  possible."  In addition to the threat from the army  and security forces, women are increasingly  the target of loyalist paramilitary violence,  Marron says. (Loyalist paramilitary groups  attack and assassinate people in nationalist  areas like West Belfast in order to try to  prevent the nationalist aspiration of a united  Ireland. They are "loyal" to Britain. InLatin  America, they would be called death  squads.)  Marron says women can receive threats  where they are told that their security files,  which contain a great deal of personal information including home addresses, are in  Women in  West Belfast  may also have to cope  with the arrest  by the security forces  of one of  their children...  the hands of loyalist paramilitaries. She  adds that one of the things the centre tries to  do is help women to build up a sense of  security, and to secure their homes from  attack.  Given the conditions they live under,  women in nationalist communities have  long worked for peace. The recent talk of  peace in the North of Ireland grabbed headlines around the world. Marron says people  in her community were very optimistic at  first when the two main nationalist leaders  in the North, Gerry Adams and John Hume,  put out a joint declaration and agreed on a  set of demands to end the British presence  in Ireland. The inflexiblity of the British  government ended the optimism.  "Britain's refusal to negotiate is seen by  people here as very bloody minded," she  says. "There has been a real upsurge in  loyalist violence, assassinations and petrol  Vancouver Lesbian and Ga^ Choir  Lois Weninger, Guest Conductor  presents ^^      HOPE    0   HARMONY  l^Z       ^^•^ A Spring Concert in Benefit of the  Mflp Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation,  ■f British Columbia Chapter  111 With Special Guest, Linnea Good  R^erson United Church  2795 West 45th Avenue at Yew Street  Saturday, "March 19, 8 p.m.  Tickets $5 at the door.

The British government is unwilling to clarify  what it means by peace, and has refused to  oppose loyalist violence."  Marron says that the attitude of the  British government has moved nationalists  from "thinking a solution was close at hand  to pessimism that it will be another long  hard struggle." She adds that one of the IWD  events in Belfast is anopen forum forwomen  to put forward ideas of what they mean by  peace.  The Falls Road Women's Centre was  started in the early 1980s by a group of  women, including long-time community  activists and members of political organizations. They all agreed on the need for a  woman-only space for workingclass women  in West Belfast.  "We started in a derelict building. That  premises was destroyed in a bomb explosion," says Marron. They set up in another  building, also derelict, which had been damaged by a fire as well as a bombing. "It was  basically four walls."  After a lot of renovation work, the centre is now quite comfortable 3nd has expanded to an additional building. The crisis  counselling is located in one building and  the other houses a creche, or daycare centre,  which has two sessions with 1Q or 11 places  in each. The centre also provides training for  24 women in childcare.  Marron says the goal is to set up a  community childcare facility. She adds that  this is especially important because thereare  no state childcare places. Childcare is all  private, and very expensive.  Women can get computer training at  the centre including the first two steps of the  computer exams. Marron says they have 6  older-model computers "that we would  dearly love to update. But that's on the long  finger." Like women's groups everywhere,  the main thing obstacle for the Falls Road  Women's Centre is money.  Our biggest project is to get better funding," says Marron. If the centre was able to  get core funding, they could hire permanent  staff who could provide better continuity.  At present they are limited to hiring women  on one-year work schemes, like the UI top-  up programs in Canada.  Marron says the centre would like to  expand their counselling and develop an  independent counselling service for thewhole  city. "We'd especially like to see grief and  trauma counselling, areas which have really  been neglected for a city that has suffered so  much in the last 25 years." She adds they  would like to do grief counselling with children as well.  "We've lots of plans-we've just got to  get the money to do them."

Arts  Review: Open Letter: Grasp the Bird's Tail:  Dreamy and  meandering  by Anne Jew   OPEN LETTER: GRASP THE BIRD'S  TAIL  ^directed by Brenda Joy Lem  Racy Sexy: Intercultural Arts Festival  Chinese Cultural Centre  December 1993  Open Letter: Grasp the Bird's Tail begins  with a shot of a young woman, Sylvester,  smellingadriedrose.lt turns out the rose was  sent to her by her new lover, Leo, who lives in  Amsterdam. She writes to him of her longing  to see him, but also incorporates the research  she's been doing for her term paper on hate  violence. Intercut with this main storyline are  flashbacks of the lovers and different vignettes  about the abuse of women using the same  two actors.  She mentions the murders of Vincent  Chin, who was killed by two white  autoworkers because they thought he was  Japanese and Yusuf Hawkins, a Black man  who was murdered in an Italian neighbourhood because they mistook him for someone  else. Also referenced are the murders of the  14 white women at Ecole Polytechnique in  Montreal and of Chiatsu Liu and Charnjit  Kaur, women of colour who were killed by  their male partners in Metro Toronto. While  "...I hardly know you.  We had less than  a week together....  Are you going  to hurt me..."  relaying this information she also discusses  her fears. "Sometimes I feel like a walking  target. Like I could walk into the wrong place  at the wrong time and be in danger because  my face looks Chinese...or Japanese...or  Korean...Vietnamese."  What is really important is that she connects this violence to her own life. When  writing sentimentally of her desire and longing - "Songs remind me of you, certain smells  remind me of you, sometimes whole days  remind me of you" - she also stops to note, "I  hardly know you. We had less than a week  together" -and asks, "Are you going to hurt  me?" At the outset of this heterosexual relationship she already questions the possibility  of not only emotional damage, but physical  too.  She poses more questions. "I'm still here  in Canada where one in four women will be  sexually assaulted. For women of colour the  statistics increase threefold. What are you  supposed to do with statistics like that? Last  year a male friend tried to force me to have  sex with him. He's white, married to a Chinese woman. Did my being Chinese have  anything to do with it?"  These are crucial questions and it's not  that a 15-minute film has to answer them, but  there isn't much offered in terms of strategies. That's one of the most frustrating things  about Open Letter because it not only poses  questions without really attempting to answer them, but also seems to reinforce the  stereotypes surrounding Chinese women.  At one point, Sylvester wonders if her  being Chinese has anything to do with the  fact that a man was masturbating across  from her on the bus, and presents a questionnaire asking if he sees Chinese women  as passive and exotic. But in each sequence  of the film, the female character is presented  as passive, exoticized and sexualized. For  example, a magician and the magician's  assistant perform the knives-through-the-  box-with-the-women-inside trick. The assistant, dressed in a skimpy outfit, sits in the  box while shiny blades narrowly miss puncturing her bare skin. In another sequence,  the female character is the subject of a peep  show and is alternately naked and clothed.  The flashback scene consists of lovemaking  in bed, where both Sylvester and Leo are  nude. The last scene, in which a female and  male dancer perform with large swords,  seems to perpetuate the very stereotypical  Asianness that Lem wants to question.  The whole mood evoked in the film,  which is very dreamy and meandering,  establishes a passivity that undermines the  central theme, which is violence against  people of colour (specifically women of  colour) and white women. Everything from  the music, which is mainly a haunting female voice singing one note, to the apartment in which Sylvester writes the letter  (and later tapes a cutout flower and a butterfly on an envelope, set against a backdrop of smiling Chinese cherubs and artwork incorporating a naked Asian woman)  does nothing to counter the violence which  Lem seemingly aims to attack.  Some statements ring true. "Sometimes  I really am afraid. But I don't want to let it  get to me. I really want to see you." It's that  fear, which is very real and valid, that somehow has to be dealt with without being  overwhelmed by the statistics. It's when  simple assertions like this are put forth that  the film has resonance because it calls up  the connection between the basic fear that  every woman has and the systemic violence  that women suffer. But how we choose to  deal with each situation will always vary.  I'm not sure what the intention is of  having such sexualized female roles in a  film largely about violence against women.  Is it to claim a female sexuality in spite of  what men do to us? Is it to say sex, love,  violence and power are all interrelated? In  terms of the lovers' storyline, is it to maintain the connection between the personal  and the political?  Open Letter succeeds in presenting a  much needed look at the issue of racial  violence, especially toward women of colour, and personalizing it in a way that  makes it very accessible. Itcannotbe stressed  enough how important this is because we  are being killed every day. Because Lem  asks so many questions, perhaps I was  waiting for the answers, which is unrealistic. But then, at least for some form of  empowerment, which for me never really  came. The film ends with a woman dancer  swinging a large sword, as if in a dance of  retaliation. But even this was unsatisfying  because, it looked like she was going to  drop it.   Anne Jew is a Vancouver writer of Chinese  descent and an active filmgoer.

Her previous works include children's poetry and  picture books, as well as short stories and a  novel.  Betty Lee Bonner Lives There consists of  thirteen short stories. Ten of the stories are  narrated by women, three by men.  Several common threads run through  all the stories. All of the main characters are  white and heterosexual and struggling to  create or maintain a relationship with a significant person in their lives. They are all  attempting either to define or assert themselves. The characters' efforts to accomplish  this are constantly influenced by the people  and events in their lives just as every chess  piece moves in relation or reaction to another peice. So often characters in fiction  develop and impose themselves on the landscape around them as if they grew in isolation. Simmie reflects the human reality that  each of us advances and retreats in relation  to the world around us.  Several of the women leave their partners because these men refuse to participate  in the undulating rhythm that is a relationship. The men do not interact, they impose,  and the women can only become individuals by escaping from them.  In "Sweetie Pie," we meet Noreen who  realizes that "...this time, she's really got to  figure it out, get some direction in her life,  some kind of order." However, for the moment she is careening down the highway in  a Ford Tempo with Al who, "on an asshole  scale of one to ten...rates a nine easy," and  Al's beloved cockatoo Sweetie Pie, whose  crowning glory is its ability to imitate a  flushing toilet. At a rest stop, Noreen leaves  a sleeping and tipsy Al and Sweetie Pie  behind, taking a ride with a stranger named  Darryl, headed for Vancouver, and "some  direction in her life."  Sharon's three young sons in "You Tell  Me Your Dreams," are "hell-bent on destroying the house and Sharon's nerve endings. The house may survive but she won't."  Randy, her realtor husband, wants to  rekindle their sex life by sharing their sexual  fantasies. However, after she shares her fantasy with him, Randy says "Next time, fake  it. Okay?" Sharon's resolution to her di  lemma comes in the form of "A man in a  silver suit with a blue light blinking on and  off in his chest" who stands under the apple  tree in her yard. Whenever he appears in the  yard, Sharon is imbued with "that beautiful,  soothing feeling." The night of the failed  sexual fantasies, she leaves Randy and her  home to join him.  Not all women leave. In the title story,  "Betty Lee Bonner LivesThere," Stella Bartlett  chooses to stay. Her youngest daughter,  Jeannie, the narrator of this World War II  drama, unknowingly chronicles her father's  infidelity with Lieutenant Betty Lee Bonner  the stranger with the "Betty Grable bust,"  whom her father brings home during a blizzard as there is no room at the local hotel.  There are other visits after this first chance  stay, as Betty Lee spends several of her  "leaves" with the Bartlett family. Stella's  growing displeasure with Betty Lee's presence is manifested in the hairstyles she inflicts on her family (she is a hairstylist).  During Betty's first visit, Jeannie tells us that  her mother "French-braided my hair so tight  I could hardly blink," while they watched  Mr. Bartlett and the Lieutenant gaily shovel  snow. "When she came back on leave in  March, Mom started looking kind of strained  and gave Merna (Jeannie's older sister) a  permanent, that looked as if she was wearing a big Brillo pad on her head." Stella's hair  becomes blonder than usual and Grandma  gets a henna.  %**       Art Emporium  Open Daily  10 am to 11pm  Your  Lesbian & Gay  Bookstore  BOOKS BY MAIL  CALL 1-800-567-1662  Women's Press and Little Sister's Bookstore invite you to the  Vancouver launching of  Outrage  Dykes and Bis resist homophobia  Saturday, March 19  8:00pm  Charlies Lounge  455 Abbott Street  Admission by donation  Info: 669-1753  Readings by  Chrystos  C.

Tel:(604)669-1753 or    Fax:(604)685-0252  During a family holiday in Vancouver  (Betty Lee's home), matters reach a critical  point. When her husband does not return  from an alleged afternoon with an old colleague, Stella assumes the worst and storms  out of their lodgings. She returns to her  distraught family the next day, looking ten  years younger and with a job at Bea's Beauty  Salon. Grandma and the two girls are to  move to Vancouver with her. Stella tells her  husband "You Know Who can move into  my house since she likes it there so much,  and she can sit and wonder what you're  doing out on the road."  This never transpires. Jeannie has  warned us earlier, "There was a terrible  restlessness in our mother; she was like a  racehorse always ready for a race that never  starts." After their return home, Stella writes  to Bea and turns down the job in Vancouver.  After that, "she hated Betty Lee Bonner not  for what she did, but for something else  altogether".  Simmie does not only examine the dynamics between men and women. "Houses"  is a taleabout May and her daughter, Tammy  Fa ye, coming into their own,' both as individuals and as a family unit.i Tammy Faye  insists onbeing called TFbecause, "She won't  have the same name as that crazy Tammy  Faye Bakker and that's that."  She is a girl with a strong will. After  having her first period at nine, she "carried  on for three days and at the end of it said 'I'm  not having it again and that's that'." She  "hasn't had another period yet and she'll be  twelve next month." Together, they plan for  the house they want to buy. It has been  suggected to May that she marry a man with  a house. "No way, May thinks. A man can  walk to the corner for cigarettes and keep on  walking. When May gets a kitchen window  with a geranium on the sill, it has to be her  kitchen, her window sill; she needs to transplant the geranium into her front yard."  Although Lois Simmie's plots vary  wildly, common themes endure. Her characters wrestle with relationships and self-  determination simultaneously.  The narrators always speak in detached  humourous tones. Simmie uses simple language which is expressive because of its  directness and honesty. By combining a detached tone with direct language, Simmie  accomplishes two things: first, she renders  her audience both affected by, yet removed  from, the plights of her characters; and, secondly, she demonstrates that, although individuals participate in and are immeasurably  shaped by their environs, we are essentially  solitary by nature.  All of the characters are engaging and  the plots original. I wanted to know what  awaited me on the next page.

Pam Brown says it's time for First Nations people to tell their own stories.  Brown,a member of the Heiltsuk Nation  from Bella Bella, says she's tired of reading  about the lives of First Nations people from a  non-Native perspective. "Many authors  would have readers believe the lives of First  Nations people are grey and dreary. Nothing  is farther from the truth than those stereotypical images."  If Brown has her way, Heiltsuk people  will soon receive the recognition they deserve. And she's doing her part to ensure  their stories are told.  As part of her Master's thesis requirement, Brown curated an exhibit titled, Cannery Days: A Chapter in the Lives of the Heiltsuk  at the UBC Museum of Anthropology. The  exhibit travels this month to Bella Bella, B.C.  Both the exhibit and her thesis focus on  the failure of non-Native society to understand that fish were and continue to be the  economic wealth of BC First Nations.  Another related issue is the invisibility of  First Nations women and men in the fish-  processing industry.  The exhibit focusses on central coast canneries, with particular emphasis on the experiences of Heiltsuk women in Namu cannery.  Brown chose that particular cannery because  it falls within the traditional territory of the  Heiltsuk people. The Heiltsuk people have  occupied the central coast for thousands of  years.  "Long before the arrival of Europeans,  Heiltsuk people had a well developed culture which revolved around fish. Archaeological evidence found at Namu suggests  that Heiltsuk Tribal territory has been inhabited for at least 9,000 years," says Brown.  In the past, both economic and ideological approaches to the fish-processing industry lost sight of the experiences of First Nations people. "The exhibit allowed me to  share with other people in my community. It  also allowed me to share a little of the history  of Heiltsuk people with non-Native society."  The strength of the exhibit comes from  the people speaking for themselves, Brown  said. "Their words and photos tell the story.  In the past, this approach has been neither  encouraged nor embraced by museums or by  academics."  The interviews with the 17 Heiltsuk  "i opens a window on a period of history which has not been well documented.  "To read conventional accounts of Native  involvement in the fish-processing industry,  their lives were pretty dull."  Cannery Days reveals that, for the Heiltsuk  women who lived and worked in Namu, it  was not just a place to work but rather had  many meanings and warm memories.  In Namu, Heiltsuk women were a force  to be reckoned with. Members of the Heiltsuk  local of the Native Sisterhood of BC were very  vocal and assertive. All women cannery workers, from youngsters to elders, were members  of the Sisterhood.  socio-economic condition of First Nations  people.  Yet despite her strong support of the  Brotherhood, Campbell didn't forgetabout  the aspirations of the Sisterhood. She never  did believe the Sisterhood was simply "a  ladies' auxilary" without political clout.  For many years, the Brotherhood denied women voting privileges. "That is,  until Brenda politely but firmly informed  the Brotherhood executive and members  at one of their annual conventions that the  Sisterhood would pull out of the organiza -  tion unless they were given a vote and a  seat on the executive. Needless to say the  In part, the exhibit honours the life and  the work of Heiltsuk women like Brenda  Campbell. Brown says: "For me and many  other Heiltsuk women, Brenda exemplifies  courage, moral strength and integrity."  Campbell was a founder and president  of the Native Sisterhood. In the 1940s,  Campbell and other Sisterhood members almost single-handedly kept the Native Brotherhood of BC in operation. She worked tirelessly to raise funds so the Brotherhood could  carry on its political battles to improve the  ■     ■ • ..    =  Sisterhood had a very strong voice within  the organization after the convention."  One of the Sisterhood's victories was  when the management at Namu cannery  took down the "Indian" and "White" signs  from the washrooms, Brown says.  In the past, academic literature has  left an incomplete and inaccurate picture  of the role of First Nations people in the  fish-processing industry. "Yes, it is true  First Nations people worked in canneries  for 10 cents per hour. It is also true that they  worked long hours under poor working  conditions. But the way First Nations people  have been represented ultimately belittles  the cannery experiences and lives of First  Nations." It is equally true that First Nations  people enjoyed working in canneries.  One of the women Brown interviewed  says, "sometimes we get together and the  ladies reminisce, and say, remember this,  Long before  the arrival of Europeans,  Heiltsuk people  had a well developed  culture which revolved  around fish  remember that. We'd go to work at 8 am and  get off at 2 am in the cold storage. I'd go  home and wash diapers and hang them out,  and then I'd go to bed and get up at 7 am, just  a few hours sleep. But I enjoyed work at  Namu."  The voices of the Heiltsuk women speak  eloquently both of cannery days and of the  meaning and importance of fish to our people, Brown says.  The subject of fish has never been an  academic one for me or my family, she says.  "Even as a city-dwelling Heiltsuk woman,  fish is still a big part of my life. Before I began  my research, I had gone to Bella Bella on a  regular basis to visit relatives and to get our  annual supply of fish. My family cans fish on  an annual basis. The whole process is an art  in itself. As well as providing us with a fish  supply for the coming year, it brings my  family together socially. My mother also  maintains an extensive trade network with  familyandfriendsin Bella Bella and Kitasoo."  Brown says that, as the Heiltsukhave an  oral tradition, they are most often seen  through the perceptions of non-Native researchers. "As a student of anthropology, I  was searching for new ways to present a  First Nation's perspective.  "The exhibit provides balance to earlier  writing accounts of Heiltsuk people. It transmits continuity through a series of visual  images from petroglyphs to modern seine  boats. It counterbalances the tables and statistics of conventional academic studies with  images of real people."

Women's Day arose out of the  protest and political activism of working  women at the beginning of the 20th century.  Among the many struggles taking place was  the 1908 strike of garment workers, 80% of  whom were women, in New York City. The  strike began at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, and grewto become a general strike of  30,000 garment workers.  In 1910, the idea of "Women's Day" was  taken up by socialists and feminists. At the  Second International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen in 1910, attended  by women from 17 different countries, a  proposal for an international 'Women's Day"  was put forward Clara Zetkin presented a  motion that women throughout the world  should focus on a particular day each year to  press for demands and to commemorate  women and their struggles. Women passed  the motion unanimously and "International  Women's Day" came into being.  The first International Women's Day was  held on March 19, 1911 in a number of  European countries. The date was later  moved to March 8. The day became more  widely celebrated with waves of the feminist  movement and following the International  Year of the Woman in 1975, which began the  UN Decade of Women (1975-85).
