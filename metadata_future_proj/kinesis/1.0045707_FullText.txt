COPE invites  The Committee of Progressive Electors  (COPE) Women's Committee was formed  in March of this year to develop a more  comprehensive policy on women's issues for  COPE. Because we wish to get input from  a wide variety of individual women and  groups we have planned a conference for  Sunday, September 27, at Trout Lake Community Centre.  The conference will discuss which issues  are a priority to Vancouver women and look  at ways that civic government at all levels,  (City Council, School and Parks Boards)  can work towards improving conditions for  women in the city.  The conference will run from 9:30 to 4:30  pm. Lunch and childcare will be provided.  The site is fully wheelchair accessible. Registration is $5 or pay what you can and will  go towards conference expenses.  If you or your group are interested in attending please call Michelle at 251-4209 or  Tami at 251-1491 for more information on  pre-registration. We look forward to hearing from you.

Apologies  INFACT tour  Margaret Kyenkya, a Kenyan medical sociologist, who is the African co-ordinator  for D3FAN (International Baby Food Action  Network) will be in Vancouver October 13 -  16 as part of a Canadian tour to raise awareness on infant feeding issues.  The Vancouver Committee of Infact  Canada (Infant Feeding Action Coalition)  is sponsoring this stop on the tour which  is geared to publicizing the need for implementation of the World Health Organization's code for the marketing of breast  milk substitutes in Canada and around the  world. The Committee will schedule meetings with groups interested in getting the  latest information on infant feeding campaigns.  Kinesis apologizes to Nancy Pollak,  whose Across Canada article "Saskatchewan: Conservatives Slash Social Services"  and to Pat Feindel, whose feature article:  "Reproductive Technology: Will The Real  Mother Please Stand Up" had paragraphs  out of sequence due to production errors.  Both articles appeared in the July/August  edition.  Corrections  In the article "Kamloops, North Van:  Pro-choice Win's Hospital Elections" some  information about the situation at Vernon's  Royal Jubilee Hospital is in error.  The Vernon Hospital's Board of Directors did not pass any new bylaws but presented special resolutions to a hospital society meeting for a vote. The resolutions concerning bylaw amendments to open membership to the general public, waive the  $5 membership fee and set the hospital's  boundaries, all of which were supported by  pro-choice supporters in Vernon, were defeated. Also a resolution to drop appointed  members from the Jubilee Hospital Board,  opposed by pro-choice supporters, was also  defeated.  In the July/August issue our article on  arpillera production in Chile neglected to  note that arpilleras can be purchased in  Vancouver. For more information contact  Morgan 255-4489.  Isis leaves Kinesis  The mighty Isis is moving on. Creating the job of production co-ordinator  over three years ago and faithfully cutting,  pasting, teaching, organizing, harassing the  typesetters and couriers, and minutely  checking each page before taking it out to  the press every month, Isis is letting go of  this exciting and exhausting job.  Next to the work of organizing the production process so that the pieces of the  puzzle all fit in an attractive and readable  form in time for press deadlines, the most  important aspect of Isis' work has been to  teach countless women the skills of newspaper production. She has been clear in her instructions and patient with the pace of new  volunteers.  She has also done much to make the innately stressful process relaxed and fun for  everyone. Her humour and caring attitude  have made the hours fly by and have kept  volunteers coming back month after month.  Kinesis welcomes Marsha Arbour, who  was responsible for the Kinesis design  changes over the past year, as the new production co-ordinator.

Two forums where national  women's groups had hoped to push  for changes to the accord have, to  date, turned thumbs down on endorsing any amendments, arguing  that re-opening discussion on the  accord runs the risk of destroying the agreement to bring Quebec fully into the Canadian constitutional fold.  Women's groups and some constitutional experts are arguing  that the accord's vague language  could allow Quebec to discriminate against women despite the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The accord assigns Quebec status as a "distinct society" within  Canada, and notes that multicultural and native rights are not  to be affected by Quebec's special  right of status. Women's groups  want section 16 of the accord,  which extends those special guarantees to aboriginal and multicultural groups, expanded to include  They also want the expanded  section to be mcluded in the Constitutional Act of 1867. Because of  a recent Supreme Court of Canada  decision (approving Ontario's public financing of Roman Catholic  schools), certain powers assigned  to the provinces in the 1867 Act  are immune from review of the  Charter. Regardless of the fate  of the Meech Lake Accord, the  Supreme Court decision is being  seen as fundamentally undermining the Charter.  The parliamentary committee  studying the accord seems, after  an initial period of sympathy to  women's concerns, to have backed  away from proposing any amendments. Political pressure on the  committee is intense as all three  federal parties have a critical interest in maintaining popular support  in Quebec. Thus far, only New  Democratic member Pauline Jew-  ett has voiced strong and continuing support for women's demands  for an amendment.  Women's groups, including the  Canadian Advisory Council on the  Status of Women, the National  Action Council on the Status of  Women, the Canadian Association  of Women and the Law, and the  Legal Education and Action Fund  are urging amendments to the accord. As well, the Quebec based  Federation des femmes de Quebec, while not sharing all of the  above groups' concerns, is doubtful about some aspects of the Accord.  In its presentation to the parliamentary committee the Federation des femmes de Quebec told  MPs that it is not concerned that  "And now, we'd be most grateful ma'am if you'd allow us to put dunce caps on  and sit in the corner..."  Atira transition house now  opening the door to safety  by Nancy Pollak  con't on page 5  Atira Transition House recently  opened its doors in South Surrey,  culminating a five year effort by local feminists to provide a shelter  for battered women and children.  The new home is expected to  service Surrey, White Rock and  North Delta, a massive region with  a population in excess of 220,000.  Since its inception on August 17th,  Atira's ten beds have been full.  "Women in White Rock had to  go as far as Chilliwack [for shelter]," said Mary Carlisle, a board  member of the Atira Transition  House Society. Formed in the early  eighties, the Society grew out of a  large group of social service workers and concerned women who met  regularly to discuss the problem of  battering in White Rock.  In 1982, the White Rock Women's Place published Opening  Closed Doors, a study of domestic violence based on interviews with hospitals, lawyers, social service workers and community groups. With the necessary  data in hand, the newly formed Society applied for funding in 1983.  The province rejected their application then, and again in 1984  and 1985.  Public education became a major focus of the Society and extensive outreach to service clubs, and  women's and community groups  paid off in increased acceptance of  the need for a regional transition  house.  Mothers want more than scraps  by June Patterson  "I watched my children walking  to school one day in thirty below  weather, and they were wearing  snow suits that had been passed  down so many hands they offered no protection to the elements. I realized my kids weren't  an isolated incident—the situation  is epidemic. I felt compelled to  do something about it," recounts  Nancy Zavaglia, a Terrace mother  of four. Her ex-spouse had stopped  sending child support payments.  Now she's organizing a Terrace  chapter of a new group called  SCRAPS—Society for Childrens'  Rights to Adequate Parental Support.  In British Columbia, eighty-five  percent of divorced fathers dodge  maintenance payments. The onus  is on the out-of-pocket single parent to go to court on her own. Because of the emotional and financial costs, and the scarcity of legal  aid—she often doesn't go.  SCRAPS wants to pressure the  B.C.  government to enforce the  law. "B.C. needs an effective enforcement system," according to  SCRAPS spokesperson Susan Mil-  liken. "Men become irrational  about it. They feel the money  is going to their ex-wives. But  they end up punishing their children." She points to Manitoba's  enforcement program which has  reversed the figures. There, after  seven years, the default rate is  down to fifteen percent.  In July, the Ontario government started the toughest enforcement program in Canada. Ontario  Program Analyst Martha Forestell  says from now on Judges order fathers to pay the Ontario Support  and Custody Enforcement Branch.  If the parent skips a payment, the  state automatically begins collection action the day after the payment is due. The new legislation  gives the state the power to garnishee wages or bank accounts,  seize and sell assets, place liens on  property, sell property, and even  recommend a jail sentence to a  judge. Forestell says, "The onus is  off the mother."  The Ontario government expects the program will pay for itself in money not spent on welfare.  That angle has sparked the interest of the B.C. government. A  provincial pilot project was set  up in 1985 to collect for welfare parents who are owed maintenance. Maintenance Support Pilot Program court worker Georgia  Williams said they've handled over  two hundred cases but she declined  to reveal the success rate.  Nancy Zavaglia of SCRAPS  says her research shows B.C.'s pilot project hasn't been successful.  The problem is there is no incentive for welfare moms to participate, when most of the extra  money will come off her welfare  cheque.  SCRAPS believes the government should be enforcing the law  for everyone who is owed maintenance money. Automatic government collection removes contact  that can be abusive, says Millinek.  SCRAPS goals:  • government enforcement of child  support  • increasing the amounts of maintenance payments  • improving parent's attitudes  and responsibility toward their  children  Sheryl MacLeod can't wait to  get involved in SCRAPS. She  hasn't gotten a child support  check since May. Her ex-husband,  Lome MacLeod has started a fathers rights group, called FACT—  Fathers Acting and Caring Together. He advocates an end  to what he calls "check-book  fathers." He's withholding the  money because he says he wants  more input in his children's lives.  Sheryl spent some time on welfare and now struggles to support  two children on a bank salary. She  feels her husband's group is "just  a smoke screen to avoid paying."  SCRAPS welcomes new  members at its first public  meeting, September 2nd at  the Capilano Library in North  Vancouver at 7:80 pm. For further information contact the  North Shore Women's Centre  at 984-6009.           "There was some resistance  from church groups and conservative, retired people," said Carlisle.  "But publicity in recent years  about child sexual abuse and pornography won people over."  In 1986 the Society was given informal notice from the now Ministry of Social Services and Housing that operational funding would  be forthcoming.  The women of Atira decided to  purchase a house and, with the  assistance of Inner City—social  housing consultants—applied to  the B.C. Housing Corporation  (BCHP) for a mortgage guarantee.  [Formerly, social housing funding was provided by the federal  Canadian Housing and Mortgage  Corporation. Jurisdiction was  turned over to the provinces in  1986 and Atira became BCHP's  first encounter with a transition  house application. The application proved difficult: "They didn't  know what a transition house was  when we first talked to them," said  Carlisle.]  Inadequate funding from the  province was another frustration.  The government doesn't supply  start-up monies because, as Karen  Gallagher of Battered Women's  Support Services noted, "The So-  cred's philosophy is that the private sector should pick up as much  of the tab for social services as possible."  Carlisle concurs. "There was a  tremendous amount of administrative work done by volunteers to set  up this social service."  Atira has scrambled for money  from service clubs, the Vancouver  Foundation and, like other transition houses struggling with basic  monthly expenses, the B.C. Lottery Corporation.  The women of Atira operate  collectively and see themselves as  part of the feminist transition  house movement. Their home is  one of three new B.C. shelters,  Penticton and Campbell River  having gained houses in the past  year.  KINESIS      87 Sept. ACROSS  B.C.  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^  BCIT Women's Access Consultant axed  by Eunice Brooks  A decision by the British  Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) to close the office  of Women's Access Consultant,  added to the hurdles for women  who want to work where the pay  is above minimum wage.  Access Consultant Brenda Pen-  gelly, with eight years counselling  experience, is now looking at her  own unemployment.  Crisis  calls  increase  Lower Mainland rape crisis centres have reported a sharp increase  in crisis call statistics over last  year.  Vancouver's Women Against  Violence Against Women  (WAVAW) reports a twenty percent jump in calls in their 1986-  87 year over 1985- 86, including  144 calls related to child sexual assault. Rape Relief, the only other  rape crisis centre in the lower  mainland, reports a fifteen percent  increase.  Karen Leach, WAVAW staff  member, has noted that the increase in calls has put a severe  strain on the organization, which  operates with a large number of  volunteers as well as paid staff.  Since 1982, when WAVAW was  first funded by the provincial government, the organization has only  received a three percent increase  in its funding and the province rejected its appeal for an additional  staff position in WAVAW's most  recent funding application.  Rape Relief, which is supported  by private donations and community fundraising campaigns, receives no government funds. There  are no paid staff at Rape Relief.  According to a provincial government spokesperson it is doubtful that more money will be available for WAVAW this year.  Choosing  child's name  In keeping with provincial government moves to bring laws and  regulations in line with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms the British Columbia government has amended the Vital  Statistics Act so that parents can  choose either parents' surname for  their children.  In addition the amendment  makes it possible for parents to  choose any surname for their child  and removes all distinctions based  on marital status. The new law  also makes it possible for parents  to give hyphenated surnames although if both parents have hyphenated surnames parents are  prohibited from giving children  last names "containing more than  two surnames hyphenated or combined."  The legislation adopts recommendations made by the Uniform  Law Conference of Canada.  At BCIT Pengelly originated  the committee to investigate sexual harassment on campus, held  workshops and seminars for women who were thinking of entering the trades, lectured to women's  groups and counselled women taking trades courses.  Pengelly held her position at  BCIT through a series of grants,  mostly from the Ministry of  Labour. If BCIT put money into  her programs, her immediate superior, Val Karpinsky, has no idea  how much. He's new on the job.  He has nothing but praise for the  seeds Pengelly has sewn on campus. He admits the four person  counselling staff is losing a "focal  point."  Her former boss, Peter Jones,  always encouraged her to believe  that the office's monetary needs  would be included in BCIT's base  budget. Back in 1979, before educational restraint, the government  ---'ñ†-.  was committed to aiding institutions to start up and maintain  offices of women's access consultants. BCIT is the last institution  to have such a position, and now  Pengelly is looking back and wondering what happened.  Judy Doll, a carpenter for fourteen years and a former member of the now defunct Vancouver Women in Trades group,  says "There's no doubt that BCIT  needs a women's access consultant,  Workers lose in VDT decision  An important ruling in an arbitration hearing has the Telecommunication Workers Union "deeply disturbed" about the future job  security of telephone workers who  work on video display terminals  (VDTs).  The dispute arose in December  of 1984 when five pregnant operators in Vancouver applied to be  moved away from VDTs because of  the potential risk of birth defects.  The employer, British Columbia  Telephone, asked the women to  sign forms requesting a "voluntary" leave of absence arguing that  it had tried and failed to find any  other suitable work for the women  to move into.  The union rejected B.C. Tel's  contention that there were no suitable jobs for the women and took  the dispute to arbitration. According to the union's health and  safety officer, Linda Herbert, arbitrator Joe Weiler's decision in  favour of the company is "unreasonable and unacceptable." "It involves a strange interpretation of  a number of crucial points, and  will tend to weaken and undermine  important protection we have won  for our members over the years."  The arbitration board held for  the company on most points. It  ruled there was no evidence there  were vacancies where the pregnant employees could productively  be relocated. The board also held  that the company has made a "reasonable effort" to find work for  the pregnant operators. On another crucial point the board said  the company's voluntary leave request was not a "layoff" but "a circumstance of an employee becoming incapable for health reasons of  performing her work."  TWU had argued that the company's request to the workers to  take a "leave of absence" did not  constitute a true leave since it had  been instigated by the company.  The union also pointed out that  during the time of the dispute B.C.  Tel had been hiring temporary employees and that temporary employees must be laid off before regular fulltime employees.  In the face of the decision Herbert said the arbitration board  was "likening pregnancy to a cut  finger but they failed to draw the  obvious distinction that an employee with a cut finger is eligible for benefits from a variety  of sources, including the Workers  Compensation Board.  Herbert is concerned about the  implications for pregnant workers  of the decision. "If such a ruling  became iJie norm in future arbitration cases," said Herbert, "it  would set us back a decade or  more."  Generally the impact of arbitration decisions is limited to the immediate workplace, however, arbitration decisions can also establish  precedents and are looked to by  arbitrators, unions and employers  for support of their positions in related hearings.  According to Herbert, "This decision is a blow to union rights and  to our women members, and the  company should not think we will  allow thb to stand unchallenged as  a precedent in future cases."  but we're in no position now to do  anything about it." Doll is one of  two hundred journeyed carpenters  in B.C.  Kate Braid, another carpenter, says she would never have  completed her apprenticeship if  Brenda Pengelly hadn't been there  to support her, the lone woman  in the class. "The men were very  competitive in school, far more so  than on the job," said Braid.  Pengelly admits the number of  unemployed trades persons may  have been one of the factors in  the decision. B.C.'s Minister for  Advanced Education, Stan Hagan,  defended himself against an attack in the legislature by Darlene  Marzari, by pointing to the funds  poured into training in the past  that have not led to fuller employment.  The Vancouver office of the  Women's Secretariate, formerly  the Women's Bureau in the  province's Ministry of Labour, has  been the scene of staff reduction  with workers moved to Victoria.  A spokesperson for the office suggested that women who are, for  instance, wanting to get off welfare and into a good job, should  consult with financial aid counsellors at their local social services office. Pengelly disagrees. She says  in her experience women are often  reluctant to approach government  for advice. She thinks that a government counsellor would not be  as aware of programs as an access  consultant.  Karpinsky says: "Women coming for counselling at BCIT will  not be discouraged from taking  courses leading to non-traditional  occupations." He also says: "Pengelly has done a super job, and  she'll be sorely missed."  B.C.  wages  down  British Columbia's unemployed  rate took a 1.5 percent jump in  July with the new statistics indicating that unemployment in the  province is now at twelve percent.  Meanwhile, according to a recent B.C. Central Credit Union  economic analysis, workers' wages  in the province have been declining in real terms over the past five  years.  B.C. Central's report states  that "real wages and salaries of  the average working person have  declined since 1982, because wage  increases have consistently lagged  behind inflation rates."  Noting that wage rates have  fallen 2.7 percent in that time period the credit union observes that  the decline is due to "more nonunion labour being employed in  the construction sector and more  part time work in the service sector."  As well, "... personal taxes,  at both the federal and provincial  levels have increased over the same  period, leaving an even lower net  real take-home pay for most British Columbians."  KINESIS Across B.C.  Fetus apprehension case awaits decision  by Dolores Fitzgerald  The Committee for Maternal  Autonomy received word in late  August from British Columbia's  Ombudsman, Stephen Owen, that  the Superintendent of Child Welfare has assured his office that  the province has "no intention of  expanding the right or practice  of statutory intervention regarding  fetuses."  The Committee had applied to  the Ombudsman's office for a review of what it termed a "misuse of authority" by the Ministry of Social Services and Housing (MSSH) when, acting on medical advice from doctors at a  Vancouver hospital, MSSH apprehended the fetus of a woman who  refused to undergo a caesarean section.  According to a letter the Committee received from Owen, the  Superintendent assured him that  the case (now known as the Baby  R case) will not be considered to  have any general application to the  apprehension of fetuses, nor does  it involve the substitution of consent by the Superintendent for unwanted medical treatment to pregnant women."  Owen also said that he would  work with the Committee and  with hospitals, social workers, doctors and MSSH to "clarify procedures so that informed decisions  can  be made  without  intervention."  In its appeal to the Ombudsman  Office the Committee had argued  that the Family and Child Services  Act (the Act used in the apprehension) was limited, by law, to dealing with people under the age of  nineteen. It argued that the apprehension denied a basic freedom to  the pregnant woman—the freedom  to refuse medical treatment and  that MSSH had no right to intervene in what was essentially a disagreement between a woman and  her doctor over a particular course  of treatment.  Meanwhile the legal outcome  to the Baby R case will be decided in a Richmond courtroom  on September 3 when Judge Brian  Davies will hand down his decision  on the legality of the apprehension, a decision which could have  profound implications for women  in B.C. and across Canada.  Ostensibly the issue in the family court custody suit is the Superintendent of Child Welfare's  power to intervene when a pregnant woman's lifestyle adversely  affects the welfare of the fetus she  is carrying.  Beneath this question, however,  is the possibility that a decision  in favour of the province's apprehension action could do away with  abortion altogether by giving the  government power to make fetuses  wards of the state. Equally important is whether the health or  welfare of a fetus will take precedence over the rights of a pregnant  woman.

In many communities concern  over the possible erosion of a pregnant woman's rights is mounting.  Writing in Kahtou, a B.C. native  newspaper, health columnist and  Union of B.C.

Dawson goes on to say that  the province's action is "an indictment of the gross failure and  neglect of an antiquated system,"  and warns that native women "especially should be aware of the  lengths that MSSH and some medical professionals will go to."  r FiNP\ZX)MveAi-i.0CA-rec>  WU.ICWS. fCK.

The decision to reduce the overall GAIN rates came as a result of a recent Supreme Court  case which found that the Ministry of Social Services and Housing's (MSSH) policy of providing  people under 26 with lower welfare  benefits than those paid other welfare recipients was discriminatory  under Canada's Charter of Rights  and Freedoms.  The government's response to  the Court decision was to even out  the rates by dropping some and  raising others. Between 33 and 35  thousand single people over 26 will  receive $6 less a month as a result  of the new policy, while people under 26 will receive a $19 increase.  Jean Swanson of End Legislated  Poverty (ELP) says she sees the  move as "taking from the poorest  to give to the second most poor."  Swanson said groups across the  province will adopt a three prong  strategy to fight the cutback.  According to Swanson action  will focus initially on assisting peo  ple to file appeals against the cutback, the idea being that if enough  people file appeals the MSSH systems will be paralyzed.  Advocacy groups across the  province will also be supplied with  copies of letters to MSSH minister  Claude Richmond, applying personally to the minister for money  for special needs. Under the GAIN  Act welfare recipients are eligible for funds for special needs  and a refusal from Richmond  would automatically give a recipient grounds for appeal. Swanson  says people on welfare will be asking for the $6 that was deducted  from their cheques.  Finally, letters from welfare recipients will be sent directly to federal Health and Welfare Minister  Jake Epp appealing for his intervention under the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP).  The federal and provincial governments share the cost of social  services, including welfare payments, under CAP. Provisions under the CAP agreement call for  provinces to provide welfare recipients with 4>asic requirements"  such as food, shelter and household needs. Based on the current  welfare cutback rate single people  over the age of 26 would need to  receive $275 more per month to  meet their basic requirements, according to a recent SPARC of B.C.  report on GAIN rates.  Welfare recipients who want to  fight against reductions in their  cheques are urged to contact an  advocacy organization in their  area. Swanson says she will provide contact information to anyone  who requires it.  In Vancouver, representatives  from community groups were at  welfare offices on cheque issue day  to explain people's rights to appeal  and distribute letters.  Sue Harris of the Downtown  Eastside Residents Association, a  key group in the fightback campaign, told Kinesis that "People  we spoke to were angry but they  were also tired, it was almost like  they didn't have the strength."  "When they found out," said  Harris, "that there was a campaign and they could get help they  felt better and people signed up to  appeal."

Pointing to Quebec's significant  contributions to women's and human rights generally, the Federation argued that their province's  political and historical traditions  made it doubtful that women  would be at risk of losing equality  rights.  In a statement to women's  groups, however, Federation President Jeanette Busque said that  her organization, which represents  over 45,000 women, is not opposed  to an amendment which would add  equality rights provisions to the  accord, saying such a move would  signal, "a powerful affirmation of  women's equality."  The Canadian Advisory Council's president Sylvia Gold told the  committee that "There are unquestionable risks" if the accord is  approved as drafted.  As well as pressing for the inclusion of women's equality rights  the Council is also concerned  that the " ... wording of the  clause on shared cost programs  is too vague." Under this section  provinces would have the ability  to opt out of federal-provincial  shared cost programs but would  still be compensated if they develop programs which are "compatible" with national objectives.  Most women's groups studying the  accord are concerned that this provision would allow the provinces to  opt out of initiatives, such as daycare, which are of special importance to women.  In late August the provincial premiers, meeting in New  Brunswick, defended the accord's  current wording and said they  would not agree to any amendments because, as host premier  Richard Hatfield said, "The concerns raised are not founded in  jurisprudence  and  constitutional  law."  Prince Edward Island premier  Joseph Ghiz, who had earlier  promised P.E.I, women that he  would raise their concerns with  the premiers, stated unequivocally  that he was "not in the mood to  rock any constitutional boats" and  that he thought the accord represented "a good deal."  The only premier who did  not totally reject the possibility  of amendments was Manitoba's  Howard Pawley, who said that  while he is not about to slam the  door shut (on the amendment),  "At this point I see no need for it."  Brian Mulroney, who sees the  accord as perhaps his most significant political achievement, is  adamant that unless there are  "egregious errors" in the agreement it will not be reopened for  amendments. Far from seeing any  problems with the accord, Mulroney accused feminists who are  organizing for an amendment as  being more interested in opposing the recognition of Quebec as a  "distinct society" than in equality  rights.  Opposition to the accord is  not limited to women. Many well  known constitutional experts are  concerned about the vagueness of  the accord's wording in certain key  areas while others are opposed to  the increased power it gives to the  provinces at the expense of traditional federal powers. As well  there is strong concern that the  amending formula, which calls for  the unanimous agreement of all  ten provinces, will make further  constitutional amendments impossible.  This aspect is particularly important to native people since they  have yet to reach agreement with  Canada's  federal  and provincial  governments on constitutional issues. Zebedee Nungak of the Inuit  Committee on National Issues told  the committee that the agreement  "Implies Quebec is the only distinct society" and pointed out the  Inuit are obviously as distinctive.  The Meech Lake Accord was  agreed upon April 30 and its final wording was ratified by the ten  provincial premiers and the Prime  Minister on June 3rd. Along with  endorsing special status for Quebec within Canada, it also gives all  ten provinces a veto over certain  constitutional changes and new  rights in the appointment of senators and Supreme Court of Canada  judges.  A majority of the House of  Commons and the Senate and the  ten provincial legislatures must endorse it before it can become law  and the deal calls for each premier  to introduce it as soon as possible.  KINESIS   87 Sept. Across Canada  by Kinesis Staff Writer  Saskatchewan  education cuts  Amidst continuing provincial  government cutbacks in all sectors  in Saskatchewan, education is particularly hard hit. For women, two  important government funded education programs have been affected by the ruling Conservative's  restraint program.  The first of these, the Bridging Program, was established in  1985 as a pilot project to serve  as a model for appropriate education and training for women in  Saskatchewan and across Canada.  A strong goal of the program was  to assist women in achieving personal career goals with special emphasis on non-traditional work.  The program, which in its first  year enrolled over two hundred  women, will no longer receive  funding from the provincial government. The provincial cutback  will affect the federal government's  contribution as the program was  initiated as a shared cost program.  Another program of particular  importance to women is the university entrance program (EUP)  at the University of Regina, also  under attack by the provincial government. The EUP enables students who did not complete grade  twelve or who have been out of  school for a long time to qualify for  university enrollment by completing a qualifying year before entering a particular faculty. It has enabled a large number of women to  seek a university education following marriage break-up or the raising of their children.  While no funds have been cut  from the program yet, the Minister  of Education has suggested to the  University that they implement an  enrolment system which would ensure that only "qualified" students  who do well will be admitted to  university.  As well, as a result of government cutbacks to secondary education, the University of Regina  has been forced to make substantial changes in many programs and  services. Among these has been an  increase in tuition fees of almost  ten percent as well as the closure  at the end of June of the University's Children's Centre, an integral part of the Faculty of Education. To add insult to injury,  both University daycare centres  are faced with having no building to operate out of when their  lease, which the university's Board  of Governors says will not be renewed, expires this summer.  The Coalition for Common  Sense, established in February of  this year and made up of students, faculty, support staff and  concerned citizens, is mounting  a campaign against all education  cuts. The Coalition has participated in and supported other sectors in their fight against the Conservatives' restraint budget.  Law fails  women again  by Kinesis Staff Writer  "Choked courts and endless delay" in the Canadian legal system  are failing women while making  it easier for ex-husbands to dodge  maintenance orders, Chief Justice  Brian Dickson recently told the  Canadian Bar Association.  "This is a cardinal fault on the  part of the legal system," he said,  "It is easy enough to wash our  hands and say we have applied the  law and now it is for the executive and administrative branches  of government to enforce it."  "But that brings very, very cold  comfort to the person whose position has been vindicated in the  court but who cannot receive the  just proceeds of the action."  Chief Justice Dickson sat on the  Supreme Court of Canada when it  granted Rosa Becker a half share  in the business assets accumulated  with her common-law husband.  Becker killed herself after years of  frustration while awaiting her legal share.  A reorganization and co-ordination of the present legal system  must happen, he said, to ensure a  woman easier access to these payments. Although legislative reform  in several provinces have made enforcement easier—through tracing  defendants and their assets—the  Chief Justice Dickson said there is  still a long way to go.  "Too much law, too many lawsuits," he said. "We need more  thought and greater sophistication  in determining which issues and  which types of cases should properly be referred to formal legal processes, and the kinds which ought  to be left to other legal processes."  The Globe and Mail  .NXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  \xx<Svxxx*Sxxx<^^  ^**x^x^x^SxxX*JS*^^  WHAT' S NEWS?  by Nancy Pollak  Alberta health  Albertan women and men will  have to reach into their own pockets for birth control services as  a result of provincial cutbacks to  the medicare plan. As of August  1st, tubal ligations, vasectomies,  intrauterine device insertions and  birth control counselling will no  longer be insured, a move designed  to save the government $40 million.  The drive to de-insure services  began last year during discussions on extra-billing when the  Hospitals Ministry asked the Alberta Medical Association to suggest cuts (extra-billing was subsequently banned). As a result of  pressure from the Federation of  Medical Women of Calgary and  the Society of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, the AMA reversed  its recommendation to de-insure  sterilization procedures but was  unable to influence the government.  Some doctors readily acknowledge that their colleagues stand to  profit from this attack on medicare, predicting that fees charged  privately for sterilization will exceed the former insured rate.  Edmonton  While the Alberta tories continue to slash millions from social  welfare programs, a recent study  in Edmonton has pinpointed the  lack of emergency shelters for battered women and their children as  a leading cause of homelessness.  Disabled people, abused teenagers  and abused old people are also  severely deprived, according to the  Edmonton Coalition on Homelessness which estimates that over  13,000 Edmontonians are without  homes or are inadequately housed.  In June, the province cut approximately $85/month from the  shelter allowances of about 20,000  single employable people throughout Alberta, a measure the city  and Coalition have denounced.  According to Statscan, Alber-  tans had 7,000 fewer jobs to choose  from in July, and the official unemployment rate in Edmonton was  11.5 percent and rising.  Single moms  Single mothers in Ontario have  successfully protested the provincial government's recent move to  deny them student loans under the  Ontario Student Loan Assistance  Plan (OSAP).  The Liberals had proposed that  single parents on Family Benefits Allowance (FBA) be eligible for student grants but no  loans, presumably because the  FBA was already covering their  living expenses, says the Group  Against Single Parents Discrimination. Loaning money to single  parents would have been an admission that the FBA is inadequate,  an embarrassment the government  would rather have spared itself.  In July, lobbying efforts of the  Group forced the government to  establish an appeal process under  which single parents were entitled  to loans in some circumstances.  However, the women were suspicious of the government's intentions, noting that OSAP failed to  announce this change in eligibility  criteria and even marked the appeal process asj'not to be publicized" on a document the Group  obtained.  The Group continued to apply pressure, including a complaint  tha the Ontario Human Rights  Commission alleging discrimination, and in late August the government withdrew its policy. The  Liberals are facing a September  election.  Traditionally, OSAP has subjected single parents to discriminatory loan application procedures,  requiring special documentation  and detailed monthly budgets.  Manitoba  human rights  Years of lobbying by Manitoba's  lesbian and gay communities finally paid off with the passing in  July of a new provincial Human  Rights Code prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The new Code also requires  landlords to make reasonable accommodation for the special needs  of disabled people, and bans discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.  NDP government MLAs gave  unanimous support to the bill,  but only after the inclusion of  an amendment that stated nothing in the code condoned or condemned the activities and lifestyles  of the people protected. Conservative MLAs, who voted en masse  against the changes, were joined  in their opposition by fundamentalist christians, a Roman Catholic  bishop, Big Brothers and former  NDP premier Ed Shreyer.  Activists credit their success to  the efforts of a broad based coalition consisting of lesbian, gay, feminist, labour and church groups.  Manitoba joins Ontario, Quebec  and the Yukon in outlawing discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation.  Fund expressed pleasure at the  favourable ruling, but cautioned  that future cases would need close  monitoring in order to gauge the  effect of the court's decision.  As it now stands, the law still  permits the interrogation of a rape  victim in undefined rare cases.  Shell boycott  Next time you pull into a gas  station, make sure you're not  Shelling-out. That's the message  from Canada's anti-apartheid network which recently gained support from the Canadian Labour  Congress for a national consumer  boycott of Shell Canada.  Shell's parent company, Royal  Dutch/Shell of the Netherlands,  is the largest supplier of oil and  fuel to South Africa, including  the South African police and military. The multinational corporation also co-owns the Rietsprut  coal mine in S.A. where striking employees have been forced to  work at gunpoint.  The boycott of Shell is becoming increasingly international  in scope. This October, a Parallel Commonwealth Conference will  be held in Vancouver concurrently  with the regular Conference, and  the Shell boycott and other actions  against South Africa will dominate  the agenda.  Rape  Women got a boost from the  Ontario Court of Appeals when  the court ruled in August that a  law restricting the questioning of  rape victims about their sexual  histories was constitutional. The  law has been the subject of controversy in various provincial courts  where other rulings have favoured  the 'right' of men accused of sexual  assault to examine a complainant's  sexual history and reputation as a  means of mounting an effective defence.  In a case involving the sexual assault of a fifteen year old woman,  three of the five judges upheld the  Criminal Code sections which had  come into effect in 1983 as a result of pressure from feminists. In  the majority opinion, Mr. Justice  Samuel Grange remarked, "...  sexual reputation is no more an indicator of credibility in a woman  than in a man" and that, in the  past, cross-examination had been  "... a traumatic ordeal for the  complainant to the point where  ... it appeared that the complainant was on trial."  Christine Jefferson of the Women's Legal Education and Action  Spousal  benefits  The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) is launching a Ontario Supreme Court challenge to have homosexual couples  included under Ontario Health Insurance benefits.  Although gay men and lesbian  women recently won protection  under the Ontario Human Rights  Code, OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) continues to discriminate against homosexual couples in their premium packages.  "If we were cynical we'd say  the Liberal government doesn't  know whether it's coming or going on the issue of sexual orientation," said Mary Cooke, first vice-  president of CUPE Local 1996.  CUPE has been fighting on behalf of Local 1996 member Karen  Andrews, a lesbian who wants  her female partner and their children included in her benefits package. A clause in Andrews' collective agreement prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or marital status. The case  is still in arbitration.  The government's message to  homosexuals seem to be that  equality is okay on paper but not  in practice," said Cooke. Recommendations supporting the case  were made by Ontario's Ombudsman Daniel Hill in his annual report, who finds it "inconsistent  that the provincial government  can take away welfare assistance  from a woman because she is being supported by a lesbian partner  but will not let the couple pay the  family rate because OHIP does not  recognize homosexual couples."  "We applaud Mr. Hill's stand on  this issue," said Cooke, "But if the  (Health) Minister won't listen to  the Ombudsman, maybe he'll listen to the Supreme Court."  KINESIS Across Canada  ^^^^^^^^^  Alicia Borsallo, member of Immigrant and Other Women Against Bill C-55,  speaking at a Vancouver vigil in August.  Refugee women seeking  abortion in Canada  face complex obstacles  by Noreen Howes  Freedom of choice on abortion—a rallying cry for Canadian women, are nonsense  words to most refugee women seeking asylum in Canada. For them, the distance between 'choosing' an abortion and having  one is cluttered with a variety of obstacles;  mostly those imbedded in our refugee policies.  Presently, a refugee must wait up to  three months after her arrival in Canada  for determination of her refugee claim. After this inquiry, provided she is accepted as  a refugee, she must wait another two weeks  or so for her Ministerial Permit and visa  number to come in the mail from Ottawa.  At that point she becomes eligible for social  assistance, medical insurance and employment.  During the almost four months of waiting  she receives only the limited 'hardship assistance' from provincial social services office, and as for medical coverage the Department of Immigration, in conjunction with  Health and Welfare Canada, may pay for  some medical services, but only in 'emergency' situations.  What Is An Emergency?  Who defines emergency? If a therapeutic  abortion board determines the continuing  pregnancy to be a danger to the woman's  health then an abortion is granted. And  yet not all therapeutic abortions are considered an emergency by the Immigration and  Health and Welfare bureaucracies.  "It all depends on how you approach immigration," said Mirium Maurer, a worker  at Vancouver's MOSAIC (a non-governmental refugee and immigration centre).  "What I try to do (with abortion requests)  is mention the case to Immigration and say  'this lady is sick and needs to see a specialist'. I don't like to say she wants an abortion."  One woman, Maurer said, was granted  abortion coverage then a few months later  requested a second abortion. "I felt Immigration wouldn't be very happy," Maurer  said. Instead of calling their office she referred the woman to a Vancouver medical  clinic, leaving her to negotiate with the bureaucracy alone.  A health care worker at this same medical  clinic (who requested anonymity for herself  and the clinic due to the possible harmful  affects of publicity) explained recent examples of two pregnant refugee women having  to go to elaborate lengths to obtain abortions.  One woman, she said, managed to convince Immigration and Health and Welfare  to approve her request. "She was fortunate  in knowing, more or less, the system here."  The second woman's request, although first  approved by the therapeutic abortion committee, was not granted.  Instead, she explained, $200 in donations  was collected to cover blood tests, hospital fee and. anesthetist costs, and a doctor  agreed to do the procedure for free. "But  only under duress," she said, "we send referrals to him and if we stopped his income  would go down substantially."  Anna Maria Espinosa, a refugee worker  at Vancouver's Casa Latino Americana Society, said the majority of Latin American  refugees don't have abortions. Partly due to  their Catholicism, she explained, and also  for financial reasons.  Coverage is available for only the most  blatant medical emergencies, she said. "If  there is a problem with the pregnancy she  might ask Immigration if a doctor could see  her, but she can only go to the hospital if  it's an emergency."  In two recent cases, she said, women were  rushed to hospital—one three months and  the other five months pregnant, and suffered  spontaneous abortions. Health and Welfare  agreed to foot the bill.  Health and Welfare Canada, who together with Immigration determine eligibility, say there is no denial of coverage to  refugee claimants.  "Anyone who comes in with a referral  (from a doctor) gets as good medical care as  you or I," said Dr. Dave Martin of Health  and Welfare. "Of course I'd have to think  twice if it was plastic surgery to remodel a  He had no comment concerning abortion  coverage per se but said there would be  no problem. "These bills are always paid,"  he said, "Ottawa would come forward with  more money if necessary."  Meanwhile, back at the medical clinic,  a form letter from Health and Welfare requires the medical staff, when considering  treatment for a refugee patient, to "please  bear in mind that public funds will be used  in payment ... ."  Entering the Maze  Based on interviews with refugee aid  workers and health professionals (refugee  women themselves are loath to discuss their  experiences with the abortion process), here  is a likely scenario across Canada.  She is a recent refugee, financially indigent and dependent upon government support, and she thinks she is pregnant. If  so, and if she chooses an abortion, watch  what happens as she enters the bureaucratic  maze—and remember a few things about  her as you follow her along: she may be  a recent victim of emotional and/or physical torture; Canadian ways are alien to her;  she can neither speak nor understand English; and she is almost certainly ambivalent  about having an abortion. And it begins:  • makes appointment and awaits reception  with worker at a refugee organization.  Speaks with worker, presumably in her  own language. Is referred to health clinic.  • makes appointment and awaits reception with worker at health clinic. Pregnancy confirmed. Therapeutic abortion  requested.  • takes letter from clinic to provincial social service office requesting medical coverage for abortion. Makes appointment  and awaits reception with worker at office.  • takes letter from social services to Immigration saying she is indigent and cannot  pay own medical costs. Makes appointment and awaits reception with worker  at Immigration;  • has medical examination by gynecologist;  • awaits decision at Immigration from  Health and Welfare stating woman's eligibility for coverage of abortion costs.  Makes appointment, awaits reception.  • awaits telephone call (provided she has  telephone) from gynecologist with appointment for abortion. (Therapeutic  abortion board meets one a week; abortion often scheduled two weeks later);  • abortion performed.  The one crucial element to any abortion  request is the amount of time it takes a  woman to find her way through the system. Every day counts. For refugee women  this problem is magnified due partly to her  ignorance of Canadian society and also to  the fact that without medical insurance, the  system is more complex.  Refugee women may also fear the repercussions of a Canadian government-funded  abortion; how will it affect her claim both  at the refugee determination stage and later  as a landed immigrant?  Since refugee claimants are presently  turned away at the border if they appear  potential drains on Canadian medical ser  vices, her anxiety, while perhaps misplaced,  is understandable.  Abortion Clinic Not Always An Option  Considering the lack of accessibility to  hospital abortions for some refugee women,  abortion clbics play a significant role. The  Toronto Morgentaler clinic, for instance,  sees approximately thirty refugee women  per month.  These women use clinic services in order  to avoid the complicated bureaucratic process. Or to maintain privacy in what is a  very personal matter. Or they turn to an  abortion clinic as the only safe option insofar as time is running out.  They might use the abortion clinic simply because Immigration has denied their  request for 'emergency' coverage.  "With no provincial medical insurance  these women often don't have any money,"  said Sandy Eggleton of the Morgentaler  Clinic. "Our minimum requirement is that  they pay half ($175) and we ask them to  pay the rest later, when they get settled. We  never turn a woman away."  For indigent refugee women in most  Canadian provinces an abortion clinic is not  an option. Nor is it possible for her to cross  the border and have the procedure done in  an American clinic. Her options are limited:  either emergency medical attention through  Immigration or passing the plate.  According to some Vancouver refugee organizations, however, few women are having  abortions. Lucille Silvazarate of the Inland  Refugee Society said women are "quite careful not to get pregnant," and that there is  presently a "baby boom" in the Vancouver  refugee community.  "In the case that a woman wanted an  abortion," she said, "I wouldn't know where  she should go."  There are other options available. She  could self-induce an abortion, call it miscarriage, and end up in hospital emergency  ward. Or she could use the services of illegal abortionists.  Isabel Saez of Toronto, a one-time  Chilean refugee and co-author of New Experiences for Refugee Women describes  entering the home of a recent Guatemalan  refugee whom she was scheduled to interview.  "She was sitting at the kitchen table, her  kids were playing all around, the woman was  deathly pale. She stood up to make the coffee and blood was everywhere—on her, on  the chair, on the floor .... I called the ambulance, although her husband didn't want  me to. I said 'this woman is going to die'  and then I explained to the police on the  phone that it was a sensitive problem because the people are refugees, don't understand sirens. A few minutes later the ambulance came—and fire truck, police, sir  The woman was terrified and her husband  was very angry. That woman's face haunted  me for a week."  The woman had been bleeding for two  days from a botched abortion.  by Aliisa McDonald  New Bills  On May 5 federal Immigration Minister Benoit Bouchard introduced Bill C-55  to establish new procedures for refugee-  determination. (See Kinesis July/Aug. '87)  Criticism of the proposed legislation  came almost immediately from a wide  spectrum of groups and expert individuals including women's groups, refugee,  church and humanitarian organizations.  Rabbi Gunther Plaut, the Tories' own Royal  Commissioner on Refugees, called the bill  "dangerous and even illegal."  On August 11 the Government called  the House into special emergency session to  push Bill C-55 through the legislature and  to introduce Bill C-84, known as the Deterrents and Detention Bill. According to  experts in constitutional, immigration and  refugee law, C-84 not only puts genuine  refugees at risk (as does C-55) but also violates both international law and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Criticism of this new "get tough" legislation is even more widespread than for Bill  C-55. Outspoken opposition includes the  Canadian Council of Churches, the Canadian Bar Association, both opposition parties, the Conservative Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Labour, Employment and Immigration, and the U.N. High  Commission for Refugees.  In spite of this Bouchard said only minor amendments would be made to Bill C-  84 and it is doubtful whether C-55 will be  substantially amended. Both bills were expected to be passed through the House by  the end of August.  KINESIS  87 Sept. International  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxvx^xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxv *  v V  El Salvador death squads operating in L.A.  In recent months death squads  have resurfaced in El Salvador  and have exported their tactics to  launch attacks and threats against  Salvadoran exiles in Los Angeles.  The Committee of Mothers of  the Disappeared (COMADRES)  San Salvador offices were recently  bombed leaving two COMADRES  members seriously injured by the  attack. Earlier one of the Mothers,  Antonia Enriques de Paz, was run  over and killed by a jeep while she  was marching in a demonstration  in support of CRIPDES, an organization of displaced people.  A spokeswoman for the Mothers, Laura Pinto, who had been  kidnapped and brutally tortured  once before, has not turned up  since she was kidnapped again over  a year ago. The Mothers are convinced she has been murdered.  The Mothers, who organized  1979 in an attempt to pressure the government to account  for the disappearance of their sons  and daughters, are calling for an  end to the six year war in El  Salvador which has claimed over  60,000 lives. Other demands include an amnesty for all political  prisoners, immediate withdrawal  of United States military advisors  and the resignation of President  Jose Napoleon Duarte.  In June, thirty Mothers occupied the Cathedral of San Salvador  in support of three women who  ; fasting in protest against the  disappearance of their sons and  daughters, who were unionists.  The Mothers locked the Cathedral doors in an effort to prevent  police from evicting them. Archbishop Rivera y Damas threatened the women with excommunication, but the Mothers ignored  the threats citing the Archbishop's  approval of "government repression against the general population."  After ten days the Mothers left  the Church and marched with several hundred supporters to the  headquarters of the country's Military High Command where, ignoring two hundred heavily armed soldiers, they built barricades to stop  traffic and chanted their demand  for information on their "disappeared" relatives.  The same day Salvadoran newspapers announced that the death  squads were re-activating and circulating hit lists.  According to human rights  monitoring groups, the death  squads in El Salvador have been  responsible for the deaths of between 30,000 and 50,000 people  since 1979. In recent months there  have been growing indications that  they are responsible for a spate of  attacks against groups and individuals in Los Angeles.  In July Yanira Corea, a twenty-  four year old Salvadoran woman  activist was abducted outside the  CISPES (Committee in Solidarity  with the People of El Salvador) regional office.  Corea was held by three men  for several hours and interrogated  regarding her central American  support activities. When she refused to answer questions she was  beaten and tortured. Medical reports showed that she had been  raped with a foreign object. She  was left near a bridge where she  was found and taken to a hospital. Corea had previously received  threatening phone calls and had  been followed in the month prior  to the attack.  Also in July two other El  Salvadorans, Marta Alicia Rivera  and Father Luis Olivares, received threatening letters and a  Guatemalan woman active in solidarity work was forced into a car  and interrogated as she was driven  around Los Angeles.  In the past several months  there have been repeated reports  of break-ins, threatening phone  calls and general harassment of  churches and other organizations  supporting anti-intervention work  in the Los Angeles area.  The resurgence of death squad  activity in El Salvador and its  spread to the United States marks  a strong escalation in right wing  organizing and parallels a growing repression in El Salvador  where, increasingly, even peaceful  protests have been brutally suppressed.

While Indian authorities have  combatted outbreaks of "communal violence" with tight curfews  which have sealed off streets and  shut the commercial district down,  the women and their children are  denied food rations and water.  The streets are patrolled by police carrying clubs and only residents who have curfew passes are  permitted to shop and obtain water. Passes are obtained by bribing officers, at a usual cost of 100  rupee ($20 Canadian). The women  Survey proves Spanish  working conditions sexist  The first major survey of job  discrimination and sexual harassment against Spanish women has  reported that eighty-four percent  of those surveyed had experienced  some form of sexual harassment.  The survey, undertaken by  the women's department of the  General Workers Union, Spam's  largest labour organization, drew  immediate approval from feminists.  "The report bears out what we  have been saying for years", said  Monterrat Fernandez Garrido, a  Feminist Party Leader. "Whenever we've brought up this issue,  nobody paid any attention. We're  glad it has finally seen the light of  day."  Over 700 workers in all sectors,  from factory to clerical, white collar and professionals, were surveyed. Nearly one third said they  had been bothered by "unwanted  physical contact," and more than  half said they had experienced un  wanted nonverbal sexual advances.  Harassment by male co-workers  was focused mainly on new employees and on those between the  ages of twenty-six and thirty. Others singled out included women  who were divorced, separated or  widowed, and non-practicing Roman Catholics and atheists.  The survey also uncovered discrimination in job promotion and  salaries particularly in private  sector and non-traditional work  places.  The reports recommendations  include a call for new laws to prohibit sexual harassment and programs to make employers aware of  their responsibility.  There is a good possibility that  Spain's governing Socialist Party  will move on the report as the  General Workers Union is closely  tied to the government. The report  will be presented to Parliament in  September.  have no money since customers are  not permitted in the notorious GB  Road red light district during curfews.  Many of the women are illiterate and many have been abducted.  One woman had not been permitted out of the brothel for over ten  years.  Prostitution is strongly condemned in India and the women  expect no assistance from police or  government relief agencies. Street  goons and college students will  even drive away the door-to-door  food vendors who are the only  source of supplies for the women  during a curfew. In any case, most  of the vendors refuse to have anything to do with the women.  The taboo against prostitution  is so strong that when a Western reporter asked the women at  one brothel whether there was  a bouncer for their protection  they were speechless. Finally one  woman said, "Why would anyone  want to protect us?"  Readers are urged to write  the Indian government in protest against the denial of  basic services to GB Road  women.

Filipinas  fight for  land reform  To a chorus of criticism from  both the left and the right Philippine President Corazon Aquino  has issued a decree ordering the redistribution of all farm land in the  Philippines.  Comprehensive land reform is  one of the key demands of women's  groups in the Phillipines. The  Filipino women's political party  KAIRBA and Gabriella, a national women's association established in 1984, both insist that  land reform is key to addressing  women's overall equality in the  Phillipines.  The Movement of Philippine  Farmers, which has large numbers  of peasant women members, denounced the decree saying, "There  was nothing to prevent Congress  from excluding huge landed estates and vast tracts of land owned  by multinational companies."  Red Zora  bombs sexist  manufacturers  According to the Reuter News  Service an underground feminist group called Red Zora has  claimed responsibility for firebombing clothing stores in West  Germany in mid August.  Eight branches of Adler company stores from Frankfort to Bre-  man were set ablaze within hours  of each other by battery operated  bombs. There were no casualties.  Adler put the damage at the equivalent of about 24.4 million Canadian dollars.  Red Zora, in letters to West  German media, said the attacks  were a "blazing salute to South  Korean working women fighting  aganist exploitation and sexism."  According to the group Adler,  which sells South Korean made  clothing, must share responsibility  for the harsh working conditions  and low pay that South Korean  garment workers, almost entirely  women, endure.  In late June there was a similar  attack on the Adler's headquarters  near the southern city of Aschaf-  fenburg.  Red Zora is associated with Red  Cells, an urban guerrilla organization that has attacked military and  civilian targets in West Germany.  U.S. gays and lesbians  march for civil rights  A continuing panic about AIDS  and a deepening repressive political environment in the United  States has brought new urgency to  a massive march for gay and lesbian rights slated for October 13.  The theme of the Washington  D.C. march, "For love or for life we  are not going back" reflects growing gay and lesbian determination  to force action on civil rights and  health issues.  March organizers expect over  100,000 people will gather to focus  attention on key demands which  include: legal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships, repeal  of laws making sodomy between  consenting adults a crime, a presidential order banning anti-gay  discrimination, ending discrimination against people with AIDS-  related diseases, reproductive free  dom and ending racism in the  United States and apartheid in  South Africa.  Kay Ostberg, a march organizer, says that there has been  an upsurge in violence against  gays and lesbians throughout the  United States.  "The Reagan administration is  sanctioning having no sympathy  for gay and lesbian rights," she  said. "Homophobia is almost encouraged."  "We have had little political  success because we are invisible.  People can no longer afford to  keep quiet. When they start to feel  they are threatened in their own  bedrooms, when they are threatened with death from AIDS, that's  when they react. That's when they  start to become political."  ¬∞ KINESIS //////////////////^^^^^^  ///////////////////////^^^^^  LIFE STORIES  Flaming radicals fear  Russian invasion of Spokane  by Nora D. Randall  This summer I went home for a family reunion, which is how I happened to be travelling through the United States during the  Senate Iran/Contra hearings.  Before the hearings had even begun, I  was struck by how much the military is a  part of everyday American life. I had never  noticed it as much before; not even sixteen  years ago when I left the country because  of the Vietnam war. Sitting in the backyard  talking with high school friends, my sister's  friend says her brother's about to become a  colonel in the Air Force. At the christening  of my cousin's baby, the mother's father is  a colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Out at the campground where my sister  and her two generations of family are staying, we start up a volleyball game. Soon we  are joined by three men from a neighboring  campsite. The game turns into killer volleyball and the women and children drift away.  My nephew tells me later that those guys  were from the National Guard Camp. Ah, I  think, that explains it.  I know about the National Guard Camp.  I grew up with it. Camp Ripley is the largest  National Guard Camp in the United States.  It's ten miles from my home town and the  economic mainstay of the region. If it hadn't  been for Camp Ripley, there would never  have been even a pizza place in Little Falls,  Minnesota, when I was growing up.  The guardsmen who killed the students  at Kent State the year my college graduation became a memorial service were probably trained at Camp Ripley.  I can remember in the sixties seeing  pictures in the Little Falls Daily Transcript of the Camp Ripley guardsmen on  "manoeuvres"—one half of them dressed up  like hippies with picket signs and the other  half advancing on them in riot gear.  Now, my sister says, men at Camp Ripley are being sent to Honduras. Honduras!  My mind reels at the thought of these summer camp soldiers being sent to Honduras.  On the first day of the Iran/Contra hearings I am at my parent's house in Little  Falls. We spend the morning in front of the  TV. At one point I laugh and my dad tells  me to be quiet. It's not that he supports the  Reagan administration; he hates it. My family has been solidly Democratic for the four  voting generations that I know—except for  a cousin who went off to North Dakota and  became a realtor and a Republican. No, my  parents are very much opposed to the Reagan administration, but they have no sense  of humour about anything American,  they have no sense of humour about anything American.  This is the first of many days that they  will spend religiously in front of the TV  watching the hearings. But we don't talk  about it and I don't know if they will ever  talk about it to anybody, maybe not even  each other.  On the second day of the hearings we find  out that the senate committee is getting a  lot of phone calls and mail saying they are  being too hard on Oliver North and I leave  to drive back to Vancouver.  By the third day a radio station in North  Dakota tells me people are wearing "01-  lie North for President" t-shirts and a man  back east has bought billboard space to post  the score—Ollie 3, Congress 0. I saw Oliver  North on TV. He had taken control of the  hearings and was using them to teach people that his black and white soldier's vision  of the world was the only true American  dream.  Communism, in Oliver North's clear and  dogmatic opinion is not an economic sys  tem or a basis for political organization; it  is nothing less than an attempt by the Soviet Union to overpower the United States.  No matter what country, what people, or  what purpose, wherever communism occurs  it is a sign of Soviet aggression against the  United States and must be countered by  loyal Americans if the United States is to  survive.  North's view of the world comes from and  calls forth two of the least attractive American attitudes—their ignorance and fear of  communism and their nearly unshakable  sense of themselves as the centre of the universe. It is a nasty match and fifty million  Americans participated in it through the  wonders of television during the hearings.  By day four of the hearings I was in Montana and I pulled off the freeway to visit a  friend in Harrison (pop. 167). Jeanne and I  had grown up together in Little Falls and  gone all through St. Mary's grade school  and St. Francis high school for girls. For as  far back as my family was Democrat, her  family was Republican.  The two of us had faced each other in debate every four years since our first civics  lesson in fifth grade. We had both graduated from college during the Vietnam war. I  moved to Canada. Jeanne had married and  moved to Montana where they bought a bar  and had a family.  Twice in the twenty odd years since we've  been out of school I've walked through the  swinging doors of Duffy's Saloon and surprised the hell out of her, once in 1977 and  now during the hearings. She was thrilled to  see me.  Jeanne and family have bought a house  in Harrison with a green house on the back  that houses a huge hot tub. You can sit in  the hot tub and look out across their backyard, cluttered with bikes and toys, to three  huge corrugated iron grain bins that say  "American" across the top.  They also have a wide screen TV which  I turned on the next morning to check on  the hearings while Jeanne was over at the  bar counting the till. The hearbgs haven't  started yet, the newsman informed me, but  we are shortly going to have an interview  with a man who is a close personal friend of  Oliver North and his wife, Betsy. This man  has known them for about three years.  The interviewer begins by asking this  man if he thinks the hearings will have much  effect on Mrs. North, who is described as  an intensely private person. Talk about a  vulture's breakfast question! I got up and  angrily turned off the TV as Jeanne came  through the door. She tells me she doesn't  get much time to watch TV. I tell her that  I'm checking on the hearings whenever I  can. She says nothing. Not "Oh" or "I see"  or "Um". Dead silence.  We take the kids into Bozeman for a day  of shopping and errands. Her oldest daughter gets her braces tightened and Johny  gets a hair cut. We have lunch in a city  park. When we try to use the washrooms  in the park we find that they are filthy and  we'd rather go to the gas station. Walking  back to the car we all agree the bathrooms  were gross. "That wasn't even American,"  Jeanne says. "That's like something you'd  find in Europe." The remark seems totally  chauvinist to me, but Jeanne has been to  Europe and I haven't.  On the drive back to Harrison Jeanne  tells me that there's an old mining town  named Virginia City that's been reconstructed by some millionaire and is open in  the summer. She asks me if I'd like to go  to the opera house and see the Illustrious  Virginia City Players. The play this month  is Arms and the Man. George Bernard  Shaw, the witty British socialist and his  anti-war hero play right here in the heart  of America during Oliver North's performance.  We leave John, the youngest, with a  babysitter and take the girls. We drive over  the treeless rolling hills of central Montana  to the opera house in the tourist trap of Virginia City.  The Illustrious Virginia City Players do  Arms and the Man in an hour and fifteen  minutes. They have cut huge chunks but the  main message is there.  The man who is the hero of the battle  is an incompetent fool who needlessly risks  the lives of his men. The heroine falls for the  professional soldier, who knows that wars  are rich men's games having little to do with  him. He only fights because he must make a  living and he has figured out that the way  to survive is to take the bullets out of his  gun and stuff the magazine with chocolates  because he is always hungry.  The Illustrious Virginia City Players are  very good. The opera house is packed with  two hundred people, adults and children,  tourists and locals all laughing along with  Shaw at the ridiculous war hero. They  laughed and cheered and clapped.  Whether intentional or not this theatre  group had found a way to say things to people that even the senators were afraid to say  in their own hearings.  The next morning I headed for Spokane  where my sister lives. Spokane is a very conservative small city in eastern Washington.  I gave up trying to tune in a radio station  around there because I got so many religious  stations. The same weekend I was there, the  Aryan Nation, a right wing, racist organization, had it's national convention thirty  miles away.  My sister and her husband are considered  radicals where they live and they introduced  me to the other couple they are friends with  who are considered flaming radicals. One  night we were all sitting around the dining  room table talking and drinking beer. I'll  admit that new heights of eloquence or insight were not reached by any of the participants including myself, but some of the  ideas that crawled out of the beery haze  chilled me to the bone.  Pete is the husband in the flaming radical couple. He asked me where I was from  and when I said Vancouver he raved about  what a wonderful town it was, how he'd  been here in the late sixties, how it had  one of the best underground newspapers in  North America and how the thing that impressed him most about Vancouver was the  everybody hitchhiked. He then recited several stanzas of "Howl", Allan Ginsberg's famous beat poem about how the "best (read  male) minds" of his generation have been  destroyed. Pete knew it by heart.  From there he went on to say how proud  he was of his wife because she was so smart  she'd worked as a research assistant to a  chemist who worked for the defense department and she had access to information  guarded by the marines. I don't remember  how it happened but we got on the subject  of Nicaragua.  Pete said, it was too bad Nicaragua had  to build that airfield with the three mile  runway because it was obvious that the only  thing it could be used for was for the Soviets  to invade the United States and we couldn't  have that. I said that Nicaragua had reason  to believe that they were in imminent danger of being invaded by the United States.  Pete agreed with me but said it was their  own fault for letting the Russians in. With  this he leaned across the table and tried to  focus his eyes on my brother-in-law, who is  a lawyer. "You know," he said, "if the Russians invade Spokane you'll be one of the  first people they shoot. You and my wife."  This was the flaming radical.  I didn't sleep very well that night, so I  got up early and went out for a newspaper and a cup of coffee. Reading the newspaper was very interesting, even in conservative Spokane. The paper was full of the  hearings, but the surprising thing was that  all of the columnists were saying he's brave,  he's sincere and he's wrong. None of the  people writing in the paper wanted to run  Ollie North for president. Actually when I  thought about it I hadn't talked to a single  American who thought North was a hero.  After that I struck with the printed word  for my news on the hearings. I actually  found reading the American press far more  reassuring than listening to the TV and the  radio. It got me thinking abut the different medias and how they work and influence  people. It also gave me the feeling that after  the first fervour of flag waving the American  public wasn't buying. Everybody loves a parade, but after it's passed people know horse  poop when they see it. Of course that's the  feeling I got from reading the press. It's not  the feeling I got from my encounter with  Pete, the flaming radical.

"Lets play  the Game."    he said,  " The Flirting Game  You know,  First you put your tongue in my mouth  and then I put my tongue in yours." *  We are talking about betrayal and  fear and rage and hate. We are talking  about incest. We have marshalled our  strengths, many of us overcoming waves  like lawyers and therapists. The yellow are  distributed to survivors. The yellow symbol is derived from the Iran hostage-taking  where, on their release, the U.S. celebrated  the hostages' survival of torture and detention with yellow ribbons. As incest survivors  we are all intimate with torture and detention. For many it was their primary childhood experience, for all the residual effects  will last a lifetime.  My initial reaction to the ribbons, tied to  that particularly American experience, was  "I am not a tree (...old oak tree..) and I'm  not walking around campus with this bow  on my shirt. I may as well have INCEST  emblazoned on my forehead in neon."  9  {auv  4,>   sujUui/s"  \   I  ■ J^  V&  <^L  X  of fears, one by one by one by one,  in order to meet for this 5th Annual  VOICES in Action Conference held at  the University of Washington, in Seattle from Friday July SI - Sunday August 2.  VOICES is an acronym for Victims Of  Incest Can Emerge Survivors. It characterizes survivors as people who have experienced incest, acknowledge it, and are at  some stage in the process of reclaiming their  lives.  There are many who have not survived,  who are the victims we all hear about in  the media — litanies of names of murdered  children. There are the victims who have  fallen into the abyss of our institutions —  the mental wards and prisons. There are  the ones whose rage has turned in on themselves and who suicide or slowly self de-  struct. There are many who do not have any  conscious memory of the incest. And there  are those of us who have some memory of  the assaults, but recognize that significant  pieces of time and event are now lost to us  and we do not know when or if they will be  found.  When we arrive at the conference, the  registrations desk, womanned by survivors  is arrayed with tiny ribbonned bows, some  yellow, some blue. The blue are distributed  to pro-survivors, those who live with a survivor, or who offer services to  Recounted with permission  By mid-day on Saturday, I willingly  pinned the yellow ribbon on my shirt. I want  the people around me to know who I am, to  recognize me as a survivor. It is also my own  recognition of myself as one of this group  of tenacious, resilient, determined, canny,  courageous mostly-women-some-men. Each  of these people sheltered, cultivated and retained that precious, elemental kernel of  themselves through abuse and assaults that  often began at an age when anyone would  think a 'self could barely have been formed.  I identified with them and I wanted to be  identified by them. Recognized. Affirmed.  Why this preoccupation with recognition? A predominant thread in the histories  of survivors is that of denial. The incest occurs, and even when a child voices the fact  of the assault, s/he is ignored. Typically, the  people closest to the survivor have a vested  interest in denying the incest. They either  deny that it happened, or they discount the  significance, or they rename it and transform it into something fatuous. The survivor's voice is lost or buried. The family  stays together.  To voice the reality of the incest is perceived by the family as an assault on itself,  and it chooses to sacrifice the victim to preserve itself.  So, as adults in varying ways and at varying stages we often renounce our families.  We become the 'outsiders', the problem chil  dren grown to adults. We are alienated from  ourselves if we do not speak, and we are ostracized if we do — the heretics. The choice  to leave is a simple process of elimination.  As adults, sometimes we tell our friends,  and sometimes we never tell at all. It is  risky... and we have already lost a lot. Often our friends do not want to hear, will  not hear, or cannot hear. They scramble for  some hook to hang reason on. They come  up with quizzes, like "It happened ten, (15,  20, 30,) years ago ... why not let it go?."  Sometimes, friends are initially supportive, but then they get tired. It is a tiring and  tiresome problem. It's not resolved quickly  or easily. These friends want to acknowledge  it, and then they want it to go away,. They  say in frustration, "When will you stop living in the past!"  One strong and shining survivor at the  conference answers them, "I am not living  in the past, the past is living in me. I have  to deal with it and recover from it."  At the conference, we create a forum to  share our histories, our pain, our regressions  powerful act, the one with both the most  potential and the most effect, the most creative because you are creating yourself, the  one that really quakes the foundations is  naming your reality and giving it voice. The  conference is this to me: A voice, many  voices — the word in the world. The path  to change for each of us individually and for  all of us collectively.  VOICES In Action, Inc. is one of three  U.S. national organizations of survivors: It  was originally founded in 1980 by women  survivors in Colorado and moved its locale and focus somewhat in 1984 when it  relocated to Chicago and set up a new  board of directors of both survivors and pro-  survivors. It provides a free referral service  for surviving victims through out the US to  find a therapist, agency, or preferably existing self-help group, it publishes a newsletter and holds an annual conference.  This year's conference theme was "Empowering Ourselves". The keynote address  was a history of incest, presented by a survivor who is a director of a women's crisis  I am not living in the past, the past is living  in me and I have to deal with it and recover  from it.  and successes and our strategies. Talking  and listening and listening and talking —  we know that this process brings change.  We talk about change and confrontation.  We may or may not choose to confront our  individual perpetrators — our fathers and  grandfathers and brothers and uncles and  priests and teachers — and our mothers.  Some of us slowly begin to be able to discern the blurred features on the face of the  larger perpetrator. A perpetrator who is so  close, that the features appear so large they  are at first indeterminate. This larger perpetrator clamps down iron-fisted, clenched-  jawed enforcing silence and collusion. This  one, represented by the judge who will not  sentence, and the senator who will not legislate, and the media that proclaim a six year  old provocative, this one is a goliath.  Each faces a goliath in their own way. But  I think that ultimately the first act for all  is the word: the act of naming and giving  voice to the name. To testify: Formulating,  recognizing, and affirming your own truth  and then speaking it.  There are many other actions that will  evolve from this initial one, some will be  personal and some will be political, some  will be public and some will be subtle shifts.  But the first and most radical act, the most  centre. She spoke very clearly about abuses  of power and the hatred of children through  the ages.  There were thirty-four workshops in total to choose from. Of these there were six  Rap Groups which were open only to survivors and were facilitated by a survivor.  Topics included: eating disorders/body image; feeling sad, mad, glad, scared; family  denial; sexuality; memories; and feeling different.  There were three Shared History sessions,  each facilitated by a survivor. There was a  Special Interest group meeting, special interests could include: mothers of survivors,  lesbian survivors, male survivors, groups for  different types of perpetrators or multiple  perpetrators.  A survivor's experience is like screaming  in a dream where there is no sound. The  VOICES conference on a very fundamental  level provided an emotional bedrock, a tangible ground of acceptance. No one denies  me. My experience is not invisible. My voice  is not swallowed by the air. Each one of us  affirms and has a profound respect for each  other's experience. We understand a deep  meaning in the simple presence of the person beside us. We survived, we are struggling and continue to struggle. Like veterans or Prisoners of War—We got out alive.  At the conference  VOICES workshops facilitated by survivors included: Incest Survivors Perspectives: Generational Incest, Incest from a Lesbian Perspective, Amnesia and Flashbacks, Sibling Incest, Effects of Violence, Self Mutilation, Physical Abuse and Substance Abuse, Boundaries: Knowing and Caring for Ourselves ,Body Memories, Amnesia, Flashbacks, Sharing and Surviving Intimacy, Being Abused By Female Perpetrators, Positive Changes After Remembering the Incest, Therapy Issues From the Client's Perspective, Helping Survivors Heal, Changing the Legal Reality: Lobbying Regarding Child Sexual Abuse, Surviving Pornography, Secrets That Helped Me Recover. Other VOICES workshops included:  Post Trauma: Longitudinal Effects, Spirituality and the Misapplication of Christian Principles, Guilt, Let's Get Rid of It, Filing a Civil Suit Against A Perpetrator, Relationships  with Survivors: Caring or Caretaking, People Who Love Too Much, Self-Help Groups, Perpetrators and Confrontation, Intervention As A Confrontation Technique.

Prior to the 1920's there was an indenturing system which placed children  who had been "rescued" from the streets  of England (from families who were too  poor to feed them) into Canadian farms  and homesteads. The families who took  these children in were able to work them  as hard as they wished. Many children  suffered greatly; some died.  In recent years, challenges to the secrecy and myths around adoption, and  concern for the plight of adoptees denied access to their biological heritage,  have brought about the establishment of  adoption disclosure registries in every  province but P.E.I. The following article describes the process the B.C. government has just gone through in setting up the second to last registry in  Canada.  by Claire Stannard  Adult adoptees seeking their natural parents will now get some help from the British  Columbia government with the establishment of a passive adoption disclosure registry to be set up in the fall. The Adoption  Amendment Act, passed in June, introduces  the first changes to the Adoption Act since  1920.  Although the amendment is almost unanimously welcomed as a long over-due step,  the fact that the registry is a passive, not  an active one has been widely condemned.  Linda McDonald, of the Canadian Adoptees  Reform Association (CARA) describes this  aspect of the registry as "terrible, just awful. The majority of our members are very  upset."  A passive registry requires both parties  to register before information is given to either. If one party has died, that is the only  information the other will receive. An active registry builds a body of information on  all three members of the adoption triange,  birth parent, child and adoptive parent, and  acts as a link between them for reunions.  John Cashore, New Democratic MLA,  says the government deliberately misled the  public by asking for submissions and then  ignoring the findings. "The Social Services  Ministry used the submissions to support a  predetermined decision," said Cashore who  is the NDP's social services critic.  Claude Richmond, Minister of Social Services and Housing, stated, "There is a minority group—I know not the size of it—  ^  that feels we should go much further and  implement an active adoption registry."  In fact, out of more than a thousand submissions received, over seventy-five percent  favoured an active registry. Slightly under  ten percent favoured a passive one and less  than four percent favoured no change at all.  The new registry in B.C. leaves Prince  Edward Island the only province without  some form of registry. Saskatchewan and  Nova Scotia have active reunion registries,  while the other provinces have passive ones.  The B.C. Association of Social Workers  (BCASW), along with CARA and many  other groups, called for an active registry.  They also emphasized the need for sensitive,  skilled specialists available for counselling  during the reunion process. As backing for  their position they point to a widely acclaimed 1984 report by Ralph Garber to the  REFORM FALLS SHORT  Ontario government, which calls for mandatory counselling at each stage of disclosure.  Concealment Legal  Associated with the Adoption Amendment Act, Bill 26, is a curious and alarming Vital Statistics Amendment, Bill 27,  which gives the government the power to alter identifying information on an adoptee's  birth certificate. This will allow the substitution of the birth parents names with the  names of the adoptive parents on birth registrations.  Richmond acknowledges that "this may  be perceived as a falsification of records."  Cashore believes that it will enable adoptive  parents to conceal the fact that their child  was adopted.  Such provisions, say adoption reform advocates, contribute to the myths which  shroud adoption in secrecy, and deny  adoptees the right to know their culture and  heritage, as freely as any one else.  Adoptive Parents  The members of the Adoptive Parents  Association of B.C. (APA) are equally divided between favoring an active or passive adoption disclosure registry. None are  against some form of registry. "Our group  has always lobbied for a registry of some  form, be it active or passive," said Donna  Gunn, Vancouver president.  However, there is a small but active minority of adoptive parents firmly opposed  to disclosure of any sort. They argue that  a contract was entered into at the time of  adoption which guaranteed that no identifying information would ever be given.  In their defence, most of these parents  adopted children at a time when social work  professionals asserted that a child's curiosity about her or his origins was unnatural,  and implied something was wrong in the  adoptive home.  "Their fear of loss is compared with  the birth parents' actual loss," wrote Garber in the Ontario report. "Studies confirm  that most adoptees claim a stronger bond  with adoptive parents after reunion with  birth parents. Those children who believed  the topic was taboo or closed developed a  stronger need to search than those who had  been fully informed. Their concern about  possibly hurting their adoptive parents deferred or delayed their search."  The majority of adoptive parents accept  the reality of adoption and support their  child's search for origins. Cashore, who is an  adoptive parent said, "When my daughter  started to raise questions about her roots,  it was the most enriching experience for our  entire family to participate in that search.  We felt that we all grew as a result of having that opportunity, and I will cherish it  all my life."  People opposed to disclosure also fear  that if the natural parent rejects the  adoptee at the time of reunion, it would be  worse than no i  Clare Marcus, a B.C. adoption reform  activist, documented the feelings of hundreds of participants in the adoption triangle in her book Who Is My Mother? From  her wide experience with adoptees, Marcus  writes, "Even those who have been disappointed or rejected never say they regret  having reunited. They have seen a parent or  other relative about whom they have long  wondered."  Questionable Priorities  Adoption reform activists often wonder  about the priorities of those in control of  the adoption system. Last year, in an effort to try to make more babies available for  adoption, Social Credit Premier Bill Vander Zalm suggested reducing the abortion  rate by cutting doctor's fees for abortions.  to the adoption process, and that she signs  the consent freely and voluntarily. She must  wait at least ten days after the birth before  signing consent.  It is sometimes questioned just how  free and informed that decision is, especially when the mother goes through pr -  vate agencies or individuals, such as doctors or lawyers, who are untrained in adoption counselling and who also have a vested  interest in their other clients, the adoptive  parents.  Mark Selman, B.C. president of APA,  empathizes with people who are driven to  private adoption out of frustration with  the government's rigid requirements. However, he points out that it is mainly middle  and upper middle class couples who achieve  adoption via the private route.  "We've got to 1  people who want children with the mother  bearing the unwanted child," he said.  In the final planning stages, money for  the Vancouver-based Charles Tupper mini  school for pregnant teenagers was held up  when then Minister of Human Resources,  Grace McCarthy, stalled on funds. She said  she didn't approve of the Centre's proposed  onsite group daycare arrangement because  it would encourage teenage mothers to keep  their babies. "Our point is that they are  keeping them anyway" said an organizer of  the project at the time.  Adoption and child apprehension are often cheaper methods, in the short term, of  dealing with family problems. This philosophy was demonstrated by the Social Credit  government when they axed family support  workers during their infamous 'restraint'  period in 1982. Social workers now have  little other recourse, besides apprehension,  when dealing with high-risk families.  Native Children  British Columbia's social workers have  called for a moratorium on the adoption of native children by non-native families. About thirty-five percent of B.C. children in government care are natives, said  Chris Walmsley, executive director of the  BCASW. Native people are increasingly  outraged by this issue. Many see apprehension as outright racism fueled by ignorance  and misunderstanding of native culture and  community childrearing customs.  Seventeen native organizations submitted briefs on adoption reform. One request  they made was that bands be notified when  a status native child is adopted. But Richmond said this would be discriminatory to  the individual relinquishing parent, and did  not include the recommendation in the bill.  Private Adoption Hazards  At the time of adoption, the relinquishing mother signs a sworn statement that  she understands the effect of her consent  "There is not an equal distribution across  the socio-economic spectrum" Selman said,  "and that's discriminatory."  He joins others who are urgently calling]  for government regulations on private adoption. "It is atrocious that no one is responsible for these placements," he said. Currently, the only clause relating to private!  adoption in the new Act forbids advertising for babies and undue money changing  hands.  Birth Parents Often Invisible  Garber's report states: "Birth parents  have emerged from their closets of secrecy  and have indicated that though life does and  did go on for them, they were not able to  forget nor did they intend to. Their concern for their need to establish contact withl  or obtain knowledge about the relinquished  child transcended any comparable need for  confidentiality."  As a "relinquishing parent" myself, l|  fully agree with this analysis. I have never  stopped missing my daughter, wondering!  about her and hoping for the best for her.  Answering an adopted child's questions  is often extremely difficult and challenging.  I recently read a sensitive, intelligent chi -  dren's book about adoption called Is Than  Your Sister? by Sherry Brunin, which I  would recommend but for one small part  which deeply disturbed me.  "I ask my mommy, 'Why couldn't that  woman who born me keep me? Didn't she  like me?"'  "My mommy says, 'You were just born.l  She didn't have time to know you and love  you."'  I have always counted on my daughter  and her parents knowing how much I loved  her. I wanted to answer the child in the]  story with the answer I wish I could tell my  own child.  "I love you so much I gave you what I felt  was best for you, even though I wanted you  very much. I did know you. You were loved,  you were wanted, and you always will be."  KINESIS  '87 Sept. AdoPtfOrt  Adoption: no easy decision  The following excerpt "Christine" is  taken from Being Pregnant: Conversations With Women by Daphne Morrison,  which will be released by Vancouver's  New Star Books in late September.  In Being Pregnant fifteen women of  different ages and backgrounds, speak  frankly about the hidden aspects of pregnancy: how they handled the social pressures that go along with being pregnant,  how they felt when pregnancy ended not  in childbirth, but in abortion or miscarriage; and how pregnancy affected their  daily lives, their relationships, and their  visions of the future.  Christine is a successful freelance  journalist. She is of Scottish heritage,  thirty-two years old, and single. She  was born into what she describes as a  "comfortable, middle-class family," and  grew up on the prairies, before moving  to the West Coast with her parents as a  teenager. Her son was born in 1972.  I think when I got pregnant I was quite  a typical teenager. I was seventeen and had  been engaging in sexual activity for about a  year, but felt I didn't need to use birth control because I didn't think that " it would  happen to me."  But then this fellow, Richard, who I'd  been with for quite a while from when I  was fourteen came back to town, we immediately started sleeping together. That first  night I knew I was pregnant. And he knew  the end of all that: "She's just a slut after  all." It was very bad. As soon as they found  out I was pregnant, everything changed.  People at school were beginning to find  out. Some of them reacted weird. One girl,  when I was crying about it, came up and  said, "Oh, I can take care of it, I've got my  knitting needle." It made me cry even more.  Abortion horrified me. One girl in my circle  of friends had gotten pregnant, and we'd all  though she was dumb and a slut. And another girl in the circle had had an abortion,  but it had been hushed up. I think she'd  only been fourteen. Everybody was screwing, but they just didn't get caught, and  that made all the difference.  Before I left high school I started seeing  a counsellor. I'd decided I had to get out of  the situation at home. It was beginning to  be intolerable. I wanted to go on welfare.  I went apartment hunting, but the stupid  part was that the only suite I could find at  any kind of reasonable rate was right behind my parents' house. Can you imagine?  I was so stupid. When I look back I just go,  'Good God.'  One day my mother said to me, "We've  decided we're going to get a social worker  for you, and we're going to make up our  minds what to do with you." As in, putting  me in a home. I said, "Nobody's going to tell  me how to run my life." I said, "I've taken  an apartment and I'm moving out."  And I went that day. I just started throwing my clothes across the fence. Everybody  in the neighborhood's watching, five families, all watching this spectacle. I didn't even  pack, I just threw. So there I was in this tiny  basement suite, which I shared with another  young woman. It was actually quite awful.  I only lasted a few days.  "Nobody's going to tell me how to run my  life."  I was, too. He actually turned to me and  said, "I just got you pregnant." I said, "I  know." It was like something happened in  my body, like a direct hit. It was something  I can't explain.  We thought we would get married. And  then all these other stresses in the relationship came up, and we broke off.  I went to visit my doctor, who I had a  pretty good relationship with. He confirmed  that I was pregnant. I got my doctor to tell  my mother, because I was too chicken.  Afterwards she wanted to know why I  couldn't have told her, and I said I didn't  know how to. She asked me, "Will you have  an abortion?" And I said, "No." I couldn't  make up my mind; I didn't know what end  was up. Enough of me was in love with  Richard and wanting to have the child ...  I don't know what the hell I thought I was  doing but an abortion just didn't seem possible to me. My mother was a very staunch  Catholic, and my doctor was too. He was  quite young and progressive, but he still had  that bottom line of "you don't have abortions."  It came out afterward that my mother  had been checking my Tampax box for the  past year to see if I was using them every  month, because she suspected I'd get pregnant.  In my parents' eyes, I was the most intelligent and promising of the kids, the one  who was going to do something with their  life. They thought of my pregnancy as being  I immediately got so sick that I couldn't  get out of bed, and my mother begged  me to come home. I was so ill I had to.  I just left everything there, came back to  her place, and she thought I was going to  have a miscarriage—she's had a couple. She  used to lay over my belly—it's so hard  to believe—and cry, saying, "I don't want  you to go through this." Which in itself  was bizarre, because I would've thought she  would rather I'd have had a miscarriage and  just ended the whole thing.  When I recovered, there I was, back at  home, and my parents told me to go and  get my things from my apartment. Which  I dutifully did. That's when they contacted  Family and Children's Services and we realized there was just no way we could live together, and they said they would put me in  a home. I was only three and a half months  pregnant. Everything had happened pretty  fast.  They were horrible at Family and Children's Services. The social worker was very  proper. She was quite young, but she had  such a cool exterior and was so fashionably  dressed. There was nothing warm about  her.  The next step was going to this special  home. Mrs. A. had a huge house and she  took in unwed mothers as a way to make  money. I really wanted to go. I knew I had  to get away from my parents. The house  was great because there were other girls in  the same situation. We were all pregnant, in  varying stages.  It was a very supportive environment.  Mrs. A. was quite loose. By this time  Richard and I had gotten back together, and  she'd have him over for dinner. By the end  of my stay there he was even staying the  night. We didn't talk about it, but I knew  she knew.  Mrs. A. would cook these great meals,  and suddenly I discovered food for the first  time. My mother was a bland Anglo-Saxon  cook—meat and potatoes. And mealtime  was always traumatic at home, too. But  Mrs. A. was Austrian Jewish, and was into  cooking wiener schnitzel and goulash and all  these wonderful things that had flavour. 1  was relaxed, and the atmosphere was lively.  She tried to set curfews, but I kept push- f  ing the limits back, and finally I was pretty \  flexible. She was quite genuinely concerned i  about me, and there wasn't a big issue  about control between us, so we worked out i  a good relationship.  I suddenly got into being pregnant. At  first it had been weird, having to tell peo- i  pie, starting to show. And it was hard seeing  old boyfriends. One guy punched me in the  stomach, which was quite a reaction, and I  didn't know quite how to take it. But I don't  think he knew how to react to me.  I did stop doing drugs. I felt a lot healthier. In fact, I was glowing. I looked great, I   I  felt great, I had more energy. Probably be-   \  cause I was taking care of myself.  My doctor was good, which helped. He  was trying to adopt my child, in fact. But   :  he wasn't allowed to, because he was too  closely connected to me. I could have done  it privately with him, but I was too con-   i  fused to take those steps. I regret it in that  I would like to have known the quality of   j  family my child went to, and I liked my doctor. But at the same time I bet I'd be visiting all the time. It wouldn't have been fair.  The decision-making about what to do  with the kid was the big thing. Not knowing whether to keep the child or how to do  that. My parents definitely made it clear  that they didn't want me to keep the child.  Everything was happening so fast, but I  was caught up in the general details of my  life. I did all the things: I went to the doc-  j  tor, I saw my social worker, I was careful  j  about my health.  I kept focussing on my plans for the fu-  ture. I knew I wanted to get my grade  twelve, and I always thought of university.  But what seemed reasonable at that point  was, I had a girlfriend who was working, and  she and I were going to get an apartment.  She would work during the day, and I would  go to school at night.  I wanted to take a daycare course, so  then I would be qualified in two years to  run a daycare, and I could have my child  in it. I would do the housework and cooking in exchange for my friend babysitting at  night. We even found a two-bedroom apartment at a good price. I was seeing a counsellor through the college about the course I  wanted to do, and what was holding everything up was that welfare would not fund  two-year courses, only one-year courses.  So I was waiting for a bill to be passed  by the government to allow me to do this  two-year course; apparently they thought it  was going to go through very soon. The only  problem was that my baby was due in July  and the course wouldn't start till September, so I had no money until September.  I asked my parents to support me for two  more months after the pregnancy ended.  And they refused. They said, "We don't  want you to keep the child." And what they  were thinking was that if they didn't help  me, I'd have to give up the child. Which was  right, I did.  But it wasn't just that. The bill didn't  get passed, so I didn't have the daycare  course, and I think there was still something  that hadn't been quite worked out with the  apartment my friend and I wanted. Everything was up in the air.  Richard also said that he thought we  should give up the child. He said we both  weren't mature enough to keep it, but that  he wanted to be with me and he wanted  to live with me after the baby was born.  tion. One good thing about unwed mothers'  homes is that I was able to go through two  or three labours before I had my kid. So I  wasn't so scared when it happened to me.  It started for me around midnight. I was  uncomfortable. I was up and everybody was  asleep and I didn't feel like bugging them.  Then Mrs. A., who was always an early  riser, was up, so I started talking to her,  and I told her, "I think it's happening." I  was getting scared, I didn't like it at all at  that point. It's the boring part.  Then as the day progressed it got more  and more real, and people were coming over.  It got kind of fun, because it was still painful  but I was more the centre of attention and  everyone was taking care of me, bringing me  juice and so on. I didn't know what to do,  what was happening. I knew the steps intellectually, but I didn't know them physically  mild up to that point. We got to the hospital and I still had to wait for admitting and  I was pacing around, trying to sit down, trying to stand up.  Then, boom, the next thing I knew I was  in the delivery room for real. Everything  was going smoothly, but then the baby got  stuck and they had to use forceps, which  was upsetting to me. I was pushing and I  was ready for it, and it was painful, like I've  never felt pain before. But I don't remember it. I mean, I remember knowing that it  was painful, but I don't remember the sensation.  I was awake and alert the whole time.  And I kept asking what was happening. I  was on my back and kept trying to look  down. They didn't have mirrors. I don't  think they did that for women who weren't  going to keep the kid. They didn't let you  see much of what was happening. That was  bad. I still wanted to see it all.  Afterwards my whole body response was  ready for the baby to be flopped up onto  me an onto my breast. But they rushed him  out really fast, so I only had this glimpse of  him being carried away from me. And that  was like, "Hey! Hey! This isn't right." But  then they put a heated flannel sheet on me  and cleaned me all up, and the same nurse  who had held my hand stayed with me for  a long time.  So I was trying to make a decision, but iv  was also a trade-off, of him with the kid,  which was strange. I think I knew, too, that  I couldn't cope. I used to have these little  hysterical fits; I'd get so wrought-up that I'd  start laughing and crying at the same time  and not be able to stop.  So it felt obvious to me that if I couldn't  cope with all these things that were going  wrong and if I felt so freaked out, then I  couldn't cope with a child. So Richard and  I decided together to put the child up for  adoption. I thought it would be alright because I'd have his support after it was all  over. I wanted to live with him; I would have  married him too, although I didn't tell him  that and I wouldn't admit it to anyone else.  I had quite an independent front. Actually,  it was more than a front, because I did cope  well with him.  Making the decision to give up the kid  was very hard. It's strange. I remember going hysterical, I remember freaking out, I  remember crying at my social worker, "No,  I don't want to give the child up, but I have  to!" But as soon as I made the decision it  became solid, I never wavered from it.  Having the kid was always made a big  deal of in the house, it was your shining  moment, this is when you got all the atten-  that well, so I just kept reading and asking questions, and I kept putting out of my  mind that it was really happening. It was  scary.  Then everything started happening fast  ... my waters broke, and that was a weird  sensation, water pouring out of you and you  have, no control over it. Suddenly everyone  was in a flap and trying to get me to the  hospital.  Mrs. A. called my mother and Richard.  Richard wasn't home. I wanted him there.  At least, I did and I didn't—obviously, I'd  left it too late to get a hold of him. Yet I  wanted my mother to know.  Mrs. A. said, "Your daughter's going to  the hospital, she's about to have her baby."  My mother doesn't know how to cope with  these things and her response was, "I don't  know what to wear!" Mrs. A. by this time  hated her anyway, because she'd only heard  my side of it all along, and she said, "I don't  care what you wear, just get there, your  daughter needs you."  I was bundled up in a couple of  bathrobes, leaking everywhere, and I was  going through transition at this point. My  responses were out of whack, I became surly  and snappish, and I'd been so meek and  totally. I undressed him and looked at all his  toes, all those typical things. I was so overwhelmed; it felt so right.  But later it felt more like, no, I can't do  this to my kid. I can't keep him with my  fucked-up life and me not knowing what I'm  doing. Still, I kept getting caught in the fact  that I was supposed to be able to cope with  everything and whenever I wanted to break  down, no-one would let me. Richard especially.  When we went to sign the adoption papers I wanted to cry and cry, releasing it,  and I was starting to and he said, "Oh,  don't, don't!" He said, "You can handle it."  So I thought, oh, okay, I guess I can. But  what it did was it just repressed it.  (Richard) asked me to live with him and  we went and got a place together. Didn't  last. He was much more affected by it all  than I thought at the time. He hit me one  night, hard. He'd never done that before.  And I just got up and called a cab and said,  "I'm getting out of here." That's when we  decided it wasn't going to work.  With my parents, we didn't talk about it.  Ever. (My mother) wanted me to come back  home after the baby was born, and everything would be as it used to be. We would  just pick up as if this nine months hadn't  happened.  I've always day dreamed about meeting him.  I'll be thirty-six when he's eighteen.  She kept me talking, and I was saying,  "Wasn't that great! Wasn't that wonderful!  I'm so excited!" I was very hyper and excited about the whole event. And because  she was there to talk to, it didn't really sink  Then she left me alone. And it was starting to come, that this kid wasn't going to be  with me. I felt myself more and more on the  edge. They took me down to my room and I  was very thirsty, so they brought me orange  juice and tea and water and milk. They did  whatever I wanted. I think I would've have  flipped out at that point if they'd refused  me the smallest thing.  I needed to be with people I could talk  to at that point. When my parents came in,  my father came up and he just patted my  hand. This was the first time I'd seen him  in six months. And I was still bubbling over  about it all. Yet for them it was, "Now it's  all over. Now we can start our lives again."  They stayed only a couple of minutes and  left as fast as possible. Then I was alone.  I didn't get that caught up in tears; I  couldn't. The one time I did cry—it started  when I had a note from my doctor saying  I was allowed to see my child. I insisted on  that and he thought I was emotionally capable of it.  So three days after the birth I went to the  nursery and I told the nurse there I wanted  to see my son. She said, "It's just policy, you  can't." I said, "I have a note." I stood outside the nursery crying my eyes out. I had  these little pink granny glasses. And this  woman who was in ordinary street clothes  came up to me and said, "Is it those glasses  or are you crying?" And I just cried even  more.  I couldn't believe this was happening.  She took me into her office, and she turned  out to be the head nurse. She got everything right in motion. She said, "Get this  girl her baby." She and another nurse sat  with me for the fifteen minutes I was allowed to see him. They let me hold him and  they went into this whole thing of "Oh, he  looks just like you." They treated me like a  real mother.  I only saw the baby that one time. It's  so hard. I'd never felt the way I did when  I was holding him ever before. I hold on to  that memory. Just the feeling of him in my  arms. And I can remember his appearance  I went wild after I had the baby. I remember a year went by that was a complete blur.  It would get so bad, I would get so little  sleep and drink and do so many drugs that  when I went to work, first thing I'd do I'd  go to the washroom and throw up. I didn't  want to feel anything at all. I thought about  the baby constantly.  Nowadays I think about him, my son. I  have no regrets about giving him up, it was  the right thing for him. Sometimes I wonder if it was the right thing for me.  He comes into my mind when I'm alone,  especially, but I have random thoughts  about him nearly everyday. I've noticed that  every year I make friends with a kid his own  age, not necessarily a boy. I don't seek this  out, it just happens. This gives me a reference point of what my son might be like.  I've always daydreamed about meeting  him. I'll be thirty-six when he's eighteen.  I've always had certain goals for how I want  my life to be when I'm that age—successful  in my work, completely set up. I've wanted  him to be proud of me.  What I was told when I gave my son up  was that when he turned eighteen, and if we  both wanted to see each other, the social  workers would arrange a meeting between  us. I've only recently found out this isn't  how it works. The system in British Columbia isn't set up to encourage that kind of  reunion at all.  I feel betrayed, my whole ground feels  shaken. I believed what the social workers  told me. The thought that I might one day  be able to see my son was part of how it  was possible for me to give him up in the  first place. I believe I can accept that my  son might not want to see me. But that  something outside of us, a government policy, would make it difficult for us to meet if  we wanted to, no, I can't accept that.  This may sound strange, but when I think  of my son I always see the clock in the delivery room. The hands are at 8:25 p.m.,  which is the time he was born. I said to myself then, "I want to remember this time."

On July 17th arson destroyed the  building adjoining Ragweed, causing extensive smoke and fire damage to the press.  Now, friends across Canada are raising  money to help Oughton rebuild her press.  Once Ragweed is back on its feet, Oughton  plans to concentrate on publishing feminist  and lesbian prose and poetry by new writers under her new Gynergy imprint.  Oughton says she came to Ragweed "by  accident" in 1980. At that time she was  working for the Canadian-owned Association of Canadian Publishers Toronto. Her  children had grown up and left home. Her  life was at loose ends. She decided to move  to Prince Edward Island, where she had  spent many vacations, but she had no clear  idea what she would do there.  In Charlottetown, her friend Harry Hol-  man invited her to join him at Ragweed, a  tiny press (four titles) which he had started  in 1973. Together Holman and Oughton  produced a number of books —one on folk  art, another on the environment—before  Holman left the press in 1981. Oughton then  sold her house in Toronto and bought Ragweed.  "It was a really amazing decision for me  because I was forty- two. I had never owned  my own business. I hadn't even thought of  owning a business."  Over the next five years, she published  at the rate of ten to twelve books per year,  no mean feat for a press that had only two  full-time staff. Her list includes a grade six  P.E.I, social studies book with a women's  rights section, a number of children's books,  regional cookbooks and various works of fiction and poetry, including Susan Kerslake's  Book of Fours which was nominated for  the Governor General's Award in 1984.  Oughton had been active in the peace  movement and in the women's movement,  and her politics always informed her publishing choices. But she says it was a long  process to discover in what area she wanted  to concentrate.  The publication of Christine Donald's poetry book The Fat Woman Measures Up  (1986) was an important moment in that  process of discovery.  "There was a book that was focused. It  was about women, it was about being fat, it  was lesbian ... all of a sudden I could see  a specific market."  Eventually, Oughton realized that she  wanted to concentrate on feminist and lesbian prose and poetry and so she started  the Gynergy imprint.  As Oughton says: "It's the writing that  interests me most. I think it's the most exciting writing around. I believe in women  and there's nobody in Canada that concentrates, as a publisher, on that material.  Women's Press does a little, Press Gang ...  but there's no place established for that."

Few  women artists survive as art-world profes  sionals. Art is often an activity that has  to be squeezed in between all the other activities that compose a woman's life. The  'meaning and content of art' is a discussion  that takes place with friends over coffee, or  gets written in a journal and never read.  "Gallerie will be a place where these voices  can come together and multiply."  Gallerie is calling for submissions of artwork and articles, and advertisements or  announcements from women's cultural organizations. The annual also offers a fifty  percent reduced price on the first issue  ($6.00) for those who order now.

V7G 2A4  Feminism and art  conference  A conference on Feminism and Art in  Toronto, September 24-27, promises to provide feminist artists and cultural workers  with an exciting mix of speakers, workshops  and art exhibits. Workshops will include a  look at feminist art theory and criticism,  women of colour organizing in the arts, lesbian representation, popular/street education, and fundraising for organizations and  individual artists. Panel discussions will focus on women and art education, women's  art production strategies, and women's art  organizations.  Concurrent with the conference will be  several exhibits of women's work. At the  Ontario College of Art, where the conference takes place, women will be able to view  six murals designed by Toronto artists, and  attend video and film screenings, performance pieces, and a slide exhibit of women's  work from across Canada. An exhibit of visual work by "Canadian feminist activist  artists" will also be showing at the Sparkes  Gallery, and four women's work will be on  display at Gallery 76.

This year Oughton attended Montreal's  annual lesbian literary Salon des Trib-  ades where a number of her authors were  reading. There she heard Quebecoise Nicole  Brossard read her erotic poem "Sous la  langue" and this became her first book under the Gynergy imprint.  Gynergy now has a second title and plans  for many more, including works by British Columbia's Daphne Marlatt and Betsy  Warland. Oughton also wants to start a series of chapbooks for shorter works by new  feminist writers.  Oughton had planned to focus her energy  on Gynergy and give the management of  Ragweed to someone else. But then, on July  17th, an arsonist wedged an oil-soaked piece  of broadloom between the building housing Ragweed and an old abandoned frame  school and set fire to it. The frame building  was destroyed.  Firefighters managed to save the Ragweed office but water and smoke destroyed  18,000 books, as well as office supplies, original manuscripts, art and four new books in  production. Insurance will cover about one  quarter of the costs. Oughton estimates that  it will cost about $60,000 just to bring those  books that were still being sold back into  print.  The fire destroyed more than the press.  It also destroyed a woman's meeting place.  Ragweed occupied a huge 2,000 square  foot space in an old Catholic girl's school,  with hardwood floors and large windows.  This space was used for women's dances,  poetry readings, and meetings of the local peace organization. Now Ragweed has  moved into a more conventional office of  small square rooms.  Oughton was been in Vancouver in August attending the annual West Coast  Women and Words conference. She says  that her visit has helped to heal her of the  anger and disappointment she felt after the  fire.  She speaks of the excitement of seeing  what women are writing (she will be bringing a new manuscript that she 'discovered'  at Westwords back home with her). She also  speaks of the support that she has received  from friends across Canada. In Charlottetown a fire fund was started for her. In  Toronto, Coach House Press raised $2500  for Ragweed. Friends and strangers have  sent letters of support and donations to the  press.  Here in Vancouver, a fundraising event in  October will be directed at raising enough  money to bring the lesbian poetry book  Flesh and Paper by Gillian Hanscombe  and Suniti Namjoshi back into print. A  fund-raising event is also planned for Victoria.  In the meantime, Oughton will be back  in Charlottetown, rebuilding Ragweed and  realizing her vision of a press committed to  publishing new writing by feminists and lesbians.

A voice over  telling us how hard it is to keep the family  together, breaking your back in the fields  all day, coming home to cook and keep the  house and never having any cash to send  the children to school. As the credits rolled,  I felt the heat, the dryness, the desperation.  The lights went up and we found ourselves  in an almost completely white audience of  about one hundred middle aged and fairly  well-dressed women: Harambee, the symposium on contemporary African women's issues, Harrison Hot Springs, B.C.  The Canada Room is enormous. We are  there to hear the Nova Scotia a cappella  group Four the Moment. The other women  from the symposium are lining up for the  buffet luncheon at long white linen covered  tables at the far side of the room, but we  don't want to pay the $15 for lunch, so we  take some seats off to the side. The sun is  pouring in through the glass wall beside us  and I lose a sense of time as we watch the  hotel guests work on their tans on the patio  by the outside pool.  Shut your eyes and imagine a ballroom  from a forties movie, where people dance  to the big bands. Open them and it's July  1987. Yet while the black brass section  has been replaced with electronics, a young  white male master of ceremonies jumps  right out of the movie, a la Woody Allen,  his energy level as high as the chandeliers  above. He introduces the "ladies", improvising from the program notes, that they "sing  about things that matter."  The stage full of equipment, Four the Moment step to four mikes on the floor in front.  The group of four women, three black and  one white, open up their voices and all eyes  shift to them. They are all dressed in white,  all look in their early thirties, each with  her distinct personal style shining through  in her hair cut. Delvina Bernard, singing  alto, has the Grace Jones flat top; her sister, Kim Bernard-Moore, soprano, the wavy  curls; Debbie Jones, soprano, the short natural; and the newest member Andrea Cur-  rie, bass, her fair hair cut short with a tail.  They sing full of spirit, introducing us to  Nova Scotia black coal miners and to Harriet Tubman of underground railroad fame.  Across to Stephen Biko's jail cell in South  Africa we go, then back in time and space  to the black soldiers of the American West  of the 1950's. Now they sing a song called "I  Love You Woman", written for an upcoming National Film Board docudrama about  Nova Scotia black women.  Off to our left two women in hotel uniform are drawing in closer to the music, after stopping their noisy clearing out of politeness. The hotel manager has left his cash  desk and walks all the way across the floor  to tell them off. A little global reality on  1897 Vancouver Folk Music Festival,  stage, a little local reality back here. The  two women separate, making a token gesture to clear as they continue to listen.  The concert ends and Four the Moment are swamped by a flurry of new fans.  Sandra and I ask to interview them together, she for Vancouver's Co-operative  Radio's Caribbean Sounds show, me for the  women's show on the same station. She's especially excited to meet three other black  women and we agree to focus on their work  as political songsters.  We waited across the ballroom for Four  the Moment as they ran after the trollies  trying to grab themselves some lunch before  it was cleared away. The woman clearing our  section stopped to talk about her reaction to  the show. From Chilliwack, she'd felt privileged to hear them and had especially liked  "I Love You Woman", and their version of  Sweet Honey in the Rock's "On Children":  "That's just my feeling, that children don't  belong to me, they belong to all of us. It  states exactly how I'm trying to raise my  children."  Four the Moment began with Sweet  Honey's music for a rally against the Ku  Klux Klan in the early eighties. They all  remain active in community struggles, but  have clearly found their political voices, as  have their mentors, in their music. The interview was another a cappella performance  as each of them joined in to answer the questions, sometimes taking the lead, sometimes  soloing, and often switching ... parts back  and forth, never missing the beat. Delvina  joked "now I always sing every thing in harmony, sometimes I wonder whatever happened to unison."  Sandra wanted to know if they had  started singing in church like many other  black women singers. Debbie had, but Kim  joked that she and Delvina were heathens,  although they had sung church hymns at  home. The spirituality of the black community had never been limited to a white building where you go on Sunday to sing out of  a book. It was a part of everyday life and  especially of the entertainment the community had created together at night, jamming  with all available instruments and styles.  Delvina described Loon Lake, the community where she and Kim had grown  up. "Everyone got together and you sang.  | Gospel, blues, jazz and all kinds of music  1° came out ... Gospel is Nova Scotia blues,  c The blues call, the cry, the injustices, the  \ ups, the downs, the happy, the sad, the ju-  ^ bilance are all portrayed. Some people think  _>> it belongs in church, some don't."  .2 Sandra linked this tradition of black music to the strength of the black people in  ' South Africa today. "It's the music, that's  gotta be the only thing that's bringing them  through this." I could hear Stephen Biko  and Harriet Tubman both resound in Debbie's words, "It's something they can't take  away from you. They can beat you, they  can do whatever they want, but they can't  take away the music. It's in you and it's  not something they can steal, like everything else. It will be there forever." Delvina  brought it back home, "Nova Scotia being as  isolated as it is, behind God's back, despite  all that, the music has sustained itself."  There are still few opportunities for  black musicians, artists and playwrights.  The group survives by each of them earning  their incomes elsewhere, taking part time  jobs, getting U.L or going to school. They  are dedicated to the music and every other  activity has to fit around it, so they can  have the time to rehearse, to perform and  to travel.  They will never turn down an opportunity to play for a black audience and the  importance of this for them and their community has not always been understood by  their white fans.  Andrea told of an incident last year in  Toronto where they were produced by a  black women's production company called  Taking it to the Streets. The production  company had done a lot of promotion, particularly in the West Indian community, and  the centre town Bathurst Street Theatre  was packed with a largely black audience.  Yet afterwards some white feminists complained that it hadn't been very well publicized, as they'd only found out about it  the day before. Andrea recognizes that they  have at least two distinct audiences and respects that.  As most of their gigs come from the  larger white community, they feel an extra pressure on them. Delvina spoke of the  • A TIME TO TALK*  WOMEN 45 AND BETTER TALKING WITH EACH  OTHER ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO US NOW.

A Visual Evidence Video:  Lesbians Playing With Fire  by Nancy Pollak  At the beginning of Playing With Fire,  a video by feminist Marusia Bociurkiw, we  watch Kelly, an urban vagabond, as she  negotiates turnstiles and revolving doors  and human traffic. We're not the only ones  watching. Kelly is being tracked by some  nameless, rigidly curious authority. Earlier, a mysterious accident—it's only distinguishable quality is 'pam'—skimmed off her  memory and now, loosely patched with sexual and sensual taboos, she has been cast  adrift.  To her official watchers, Kelly is an experimental surface: a moral paint job that  may or may not withstand collisions with  experience and touch and emotion. To the  other watchers, ourselves, Playing With  Fire is an experimental surface too: a  beautifully written drama in which Bociurkiw stages collisions: between pleasure  and dread, memory and fantasy, poverty  and desire.  Playing With Fire and Bociurkiw appeared in Vancouver recently as part of  the Visual Evidence series organized by the  Vancouver Artists League and the Coalition  For The Right To View. [Visual Evidence  was an ambitious array of video screenings  and workshops about sexuality and sexual  images, co-curated by Sara Diamond and  Karen Knights. Feminist, lesbian, gay and  anti-racist works were represented.  Organized in part as a protest against  pending changes to the Criminal Code re:  pornography, Visual Evidence was also held  in defiance of the B.C. Film Classification  Board whose regulations were expanded last  year to encompass videos. Many of the  videos carried sexually explicit scenes; none  were submitted to the Board.  Shelter and Surveillance  Playing With Fire's storyline is simple.  Kelly, homeless, harassed by welfare and under surveillance, attaches herself to Sonya  in a neighbourhood cafe. Sonya, a seriously burned-out socialist feminist (she's serious and burned out: about relationships  with men, about politics, about feeling anything), takes this homeless woman home.  Sonya works for a housing-crisis agency and,  as she tells her friend Anna, she's tired of  avoiding the people she is supposedly helping.  Besides, Kelly is gentle ... and then,  Kelly is weirder than hell, and irritating  and embarrassing. (Playing With Fire has  many funny moments). Over time, Kelly  gleans new powers within the shelter Sonya  offers and Sonya, in turn, is softened by  Kelly's vulnerability. They become lovers.  The surveillance persists. Although arriving from opposite ends, their transformations have been the same: they have started  to feel. And, not the least, they have started  to have sex. (Presumably. We don't actually  get to see much of that.)  Playing With Fire is released by Emma  Productions, a Toronto feminist video  collective whose previous works include  Stronger Than Before (on women's resistance to militarism) and No Small Change  (on the Eaton's strike). Bociurkiw, who has  a background in documentary and experimental video, wrote and directed Playing  With Fire, her first feature-length narrative. In Vancouver, she spoke of its origins.  "Playing With Fire came from a political urge to address both the censorship  issue, and the lack of positive sexual imagery within women's cultural productions.  I wanted there to be something dealing with  women's sexuality besides that which deals  with the more troubled side of women as  sexual beings: reproductive rights, battering, abuse. These issues are really important ... but I have felt there has been an  unfortunate focus on danger or pain or fear,  omitting strategy and pleasure."  For Bociurkiw, a major strategy is for  women to retrieve what has been denied.  "I thought a lot about what it is to have  pleasurable images, or history, or a culture  taken away from you through the workings  of the state, or patriarchy."  For both Kelly and Sonya, sexual memory has been clouded to the point of nonexistence: Kelly, through an 'accident' whose  vague contours hint at sexual abuse; Sonya,  through attrition: years of being strong and  strongly disappointed within heterosexual  relationships, so that fear and intimacy have  become simultaneous, and vulnerability a  seeming impossibility.  Yet it is because of their willingness to  examine losses and their mutual unwillingness to live without sensation or risk that  Kelly and Sonya thrive. As Bociurkiw said,  "I was trying to do a bit of reconstruction:  there are solutions and ideas and positive  resolutions that we come up with all the  time, just when we're talking, in groups or  with our friends."  The Cost of Aberrance  Throughout Playing With Fire, Bociurkiw considers how sexuality and poverty  interplay. When Kelly asks herself what  she wants, she answers: "Being on welfare  means you're not supposed to have a sex  life ... all your privacy is taken away and  anything you might want to do in private,  including sex. You're not supposed to have  anything they didn't give you themselves."  Bociurkiw adds: "Those ideas come from  women who are single mothers on welfare.  Welfare workers and children's aid workers  watch you and ask why your bed is so big  and who was that who left your apartment  in the morning ... Sexuality becomes something that is oppressive ...  "As Teresa De Lauretis, a feminist theorist, said, sexuality is a term related to  power, and a debate that has been defined  by white educated women. That debate has  to broaden itself and becomes more inclusive."  Sonya and Kelly's choosing of each  other—of lesbianism—is, for all its obviousness, not directly examined. (That it is  an aberrant choice, and probably punishable, is made amply clear by the surveil-  lants.) Instead, the viewer is left with a  sense that something joyful, healthy-and  somehow easy—has been gained.  As Sonya says: "Instead of touching and  thinking/Touch, invasion, prepare fortification,' I just touched. I just let my body be  happy."  Bociurkiw's writing is often lyric, and  fire imagery abounds. Commenting on the  video's title, she said: " At the International  Gay Association conference in Toronto, I  heard a Peruvian lesbian talk about her really closeted life in Peru where she lives  with her lover and family. In much of Latin  America, extended families are common due  to a lot of factors, not the least of which is  poverty. They are not out to her family.  "She talked about the conflicts between  her traditions and her lesbian community.  She said it was as though she has gone  through fire to realize her lesbianism and  that, through that fire, she felt she had lost  touch with much of her history ...  Scene from Playing With Fire.  "That's true for many of us ... in becoming lesbians, we lose the ability to be as visible, as validated, but what we get instead  Playing With Fire has weaknesses.  The editing is occasionally sluggish, and  the sound track has that familiar, noncommercial background roar. Also, the  surveillants are both too poetic and too  zombied: as creepy cops, they lack shallowness.  Happily, the three main players put in  excellent performances (the acting in Playing With Fire is a highlight): Janine Fuller  (Kelly), Maureen White (Sonya) and Kate  Lushington (Anna).  Playing With Fire is distributed by  Vancouver's Women in Focus, 456 W.  Broadway, Suite 204. Check it out.

TheatreSpace is presenting it's largest  Festival this year. There will be one hundred groups and eleven venues, for a total of  450 performances. Seventy-two new Canadian works will be performed.  The Festival runs from noon to midnight  each day. Each act sets their own show price,  (a maximum of $5.00 and many going for  less) and the act receives one hundred percent of the box office receipts. Tickets go on  sale one-half hour before each performance  at the venue.  New to the Fringe Festival this year are  the Free Fringe Forums. Panel discussions  and workshops will deal with such issues as  Pornography and the Performing Arts and  Women in the Arts. See Bulletin Board for  further program information.  VIEW plans  forum, festival  by Karen Shave  VIEW, the Performing Arts Society, is a  collectively-run, non-profit organization of  women in the performing arts in B.C.  VIEW's purpose is "to encourage artistic development and to facilitate communications among women of various disciplines,  cultural backgrounds and levels of experience with a 'view' to raising the status of  women artists in the community at large."  VIEW will be facilitating a Free Fringe  Forum: "Women In The Arts". Special  guests will discuss "What Does Your Sex  Have To Do With Your Art?" Friday  September 18th, 12:00 - 2 pm at The Fringe  Club, Mt. Pleasant Legion, 185 E. 11th at  Main Street.  VIEW is also planning a festival in celebration of women's contributions to the performing arts of all disciplines in B.C., to be  held in August, 1988.  Deadline for submissions is September  15, 1987.  Interested women are invited to drop in  to VIEW's monthly meetings. For further  information on the Fringe Forum or VIEW's  1988 conference contact Jane Heyman at  731-6832.  Women are involved in all aspects of the  Fringe Festival. Roughly ten percent of the  acts at the Festival are by women and for  women. The Fringe is a non-juried festival  and uses a first come, first included policy.  Not all of the shows that include women  are listed here. These few shows do reflect  the diversity of women in the performing  arts and the Fringe Festival itself.  5 4^ Unnatural Acts —presented by  Down In Front.

Jackie Hegadorn as    op  I nvip   Si77lp ^  Women's cultural network formed  IBYML  by Connie Kuhns  This summer I was one of eighteen representatives from seven provinces who met in  Saskatoon to discuss the development of a  women's music network in Canada. The result of this two day conference was the formation of the Alliance for the Production of  Women's Performing Arts.  The conference was the inspiration of a  group of women from across Canada who  met during the Canadian Women's Music  and Cultural Festival in Winnipeg in 1985.  The following October a smaller group of  women met and applied for a grant from  the Women's Program of the Secretary of  State. In February 1986 a revised proposal  was submitted and a year later it was approved. On the weekend of May 2, 1987, we  assembled at the Parktown Motor Hotel on  the banks of the South Saskatchewan River.  Of the women present, the majority had  experience producing concerts or festivals,  although the amount of experience varied.  A few of the women became involved in concert production simply because there was no  one else available and a benefit was needed  to support a particular cause. It was not  their preoccupation. Other women made  their living producing concerts and had  their own companies. Four of the women  were directly involved in producing the  Women's Music and Cultural Festival in  Winnipeg.  There were several women with experience managing performers and distributing  records. Three of the women were experienced sound engineers. The media was represented by myself and Sharon Costello, also  from B.C.  At least half of the women had been involved in the music business for ten years,  with a few of us looking forward to our fifteen year pin. Clearly the old timers were  ready to move, while women who had just  recently become involved wanted to proceed more slowly and keep the organization  small.  We were chosen by reputation and from  a mailing list compiled at the Winnipeg festivals.  Despite the best efforts on behalf of  the organizers, representatives could not be  found for Newfoundland, P.E.I., the Yukon  and Northwest Territories. Out of the eighteen women present, only two women outside of Quebec could speak French. And we  were all white. Although class differences  were not discussed, naturally there were  However the mood of this conference was  completely uplifting. Our accommodations  were perfect. The food was great. And the  women were genuinely glad to meet each  other.  But our time was limited. It took one  day to introduce ourselves and to give regional reports. The second and final day  was divided up between organizing next  year's conference (to be held in Halifax),  discussing our goals and basis of unity, es  tablishing committees for funding and future workshops, and of course, deciding on  One of our first projects will be to publish  a directory of women involved in the performing arts business. This includes managers, booking agents, sound and lighting technicians, record distributors, concert producers and club owners, performers  and journalists working in music, comedy,  drama and dance.

The final steps were taken toward  solidifying a women's cultural network. If  used by the women we've vowed to support,  the Alliance for the Production of Women's  Performing Arts has the potential to encourage, educate, unite and promote the  women who are contributing to the cultural  and political growth of this country.  KINESIS  '87 Sept. $$*ssa*********ss*s***^^  by  Wendy   Frost  and   Michele  Valiquette  September and school days have rolled  around once again. Time to shake the sand  out of your shoes, sharpen your pencils and  ... open the pages of another feminist periodical. The first two journals we're going  to look at this month are put out by collectives of teachers and their immediate appeal may be to others working in schools.  But as most feminists will agree, education  in one form or another simply comes with  the territory. So, whether your teaching and  learning takes place in the classroom or outside its walls, we think you're likely to find  something of interest here.  Radical Teacher, now in its thirteenth  year of publication, is edited by a self-  described "group of dissident college teachers of English." It differs from other feminist periodicals we have discussed in that  the collective is made up of both women  and men; but there is no question of their  commitment to putting feminist and socialist theory into practice—in the classroom and beyond. As the definition on the  back cover of recent issues puts it: "Radical  teachers work with themselves, their classes,  and their colleagues to discover, name, and  change sexism, racism, classism, and heterosexism."  Each of the three annual issues is theme  oriented. Over the years these have included: Women's Studies (# 6, # 10),  Mass Culture (# 13), Working Class Writers (# 15), Peace Studies (# 26), Marxist  Teaching—A Guide (# 7), Sexuality (# 29),  and Women in Science (# 30). Although articles focus primarily on senior high school  and college, much of the material would be  useful to teachers (or parents) involved at  other levels. Adult education, in settings  ranging from inner city night classes to prisons, is a frequent emphasis.  Readers interested in women's writing  will be particularly delighted by Radical  Teacher's offerings. Widely read feminist  ffi  Airheart  V     c<  Co-operative Travel Centre  Deborah Bradley  Ellen Frank  Frances Wasserlein  James Micklewright  Judy Brooksbank  2149 Commercial Drive  Vancouver, B.C.

And we  have collected articles on poetry workshops,  women's prison writing, feminist pedagogy,  lesbian studies, multicultural women's studies, collective teaching and learning. One  (among many) which we have consulted  over and over is Paul Lauter's immensely  useful bibliographic essay on a much neglected subject, "Working Class Women's  Literature," in # 15.  The regular feature, "News for Educational Workers," lists valuable resources and  tidbits of information on everything from  anti-racist teaching materials to educational  workers organizing unions. And, discussions  of teaching practice frequently include detailed course descriptions.  In addition to all this, Radical Teacher  is affordable: three issues per year cost $12  SU.S.) for those who are employed and $8  U.S.) for those who are unemployed, work  part-time or are retired. Back issues are currently available at the unbelievable price of  $1 (U.S.) each.  Feminist Teacher is another rich source  of information for feminist educators. It  is directed at those working "in a variety  of disciplines and on all levels—preschool  to graduate school ... in traditional as  well as non-traditional settings." Established in 1984, the journal especially encourages reader contributions; these generally  include teaching strategies, course descriptions, bibliographies and other resources, as  well as anecdotal accounts of teaching experiences.  In the words of its editorial statement,  Feminist Teacher's primary goal is "combatting sexism and other forms of oppression in the classroom." And, a survey of  the contents of a recent issue revealed that  the collective is not merely paying lip service to those 'other forms': two articles in  volume 2, # 3 look at Alice Walker's The  Colour Purple, and discuss the problems  and possibilities of presenting this black  lesbian experience to predominantly white,  middle class, and generally homophobic students. Another recounts the experience of a  white Jewish lesbian who has come out to  her mainly black high school students.  The same issue offers a bibliography of  lesbian feminist literary criticism, a survey  of women's studies courses in Great Britain,  and a piece about explaining the use of non-  sexist teaching materials to parents. The articles tend to be very accessible and those  on personal teaching experiences are both  thoughtful and thought-provoking.  Feminist educators will want to check  out the networking and resources sections  of the journal on a regular basis: "Feminist Teacher Network" offers short, varied  pieces on events and developments in the  field—from a report on sexual harassment  of graduate students to a study of the needs  of disabled college students and an account  of anti-apartheid demonstrations at graduation. The "Teaching Resources" department, also a regular feature, lists curriculum materials, videos, useful reports, periodicals, directories and more.  Feminist Teacher is published three  times a year and is available from 442 Bal-  lantine Hall, Indiana University, Blooming-  ton, In. 47405. Rates are $15 (U.S.) per year  for individuals outside the U.S., $20 (U.S.)  for institutions.  Canadian women- in-print have been especially busy of late as both the number  of new periodicals and of those that have  passed the test of time bear witness. According to our calculations there are currently at least sixty-four Canadian feminist  publications out there ...  A newcomer that recently caught our eye  is Tiger Lily, the first on-going publication we know of produced by and about  Canadian women of colour. In her introduction to the premiere issue—the result  of two years brainstorming and planning—  publisher/editor Ann Wallace explains why  the name Tiger Lily was chosen:  The tiger lily flower comes in many  colours, is rooted and at the same  time rootless; it survives under any  conditions and grows in most countries throughout the world. Though it  is known by different names, the tiger  lily flower has retained its strong identity both in foreign and indigenous soils.  The title of the magazine ... expresses  our strengths and our vulnerability.  Several pages later, co-editor Ayanna  Black stresses the need for "women of colour  to create and control our own images and  break down the stereotypes that historically, society has created for us."  The cultural contributions in the first two  bsues of Tiger Lily are particularly strong.  There's poetry and prose from Claire K.  Harris, Theresa Lewis, Himani Bannerji and  Carol Talbot, a range of music and book reviews, and several superb essays. Marjorie  Agosin looks at the life and work of disappeared Guatemalan poet and founder of  Fern magazine, Adelaide Foppa. And, if you  missed Himani Bannerji's talk at "The Heat  is On" conference in Vancouver in 1985, •  Tiger Lily offers a second chance with  an article based on it: "Popular Images of  South Asian Women" (#1). This essay, like  Adrienne Shadd's in issue #2, "300 Years of  Black Women in Canadian History," points  to an extraordinary gap in our country's  cultural and historical awareness. Add both  to your "must read" list.  Future issues of Tiger Lily will draw  on writers from "the black diaspora, Latin  America, Native America, South and East  Asia" and the editors promise a variety  of topics: education, health, sexuality, language, the arts, business, ways of working  together, politics and peace. The first two  issues have run to forty pages each; individual articles are usually two or three. Glossy  covers and generous use of blank space make  Tiger Lily visually attractive as well. If you  don't see it on local bookstore shelves, be  sure to ask.  Tiger Lily is published five times a year.  Annual subscription rates are $14.75.

The first issue of Women and Environments, another Canadian publication,  came out in 1976. Its growth from an informal newsletter to a glossy cover magazine is a model both of feminist publishing  and of the development of women's studies. As Gerda Wekerle, one of the journal's  founders, explains in the tenth anniversary  issue (Fall 1986), Women and Environments helped to create a new field of study:  "the role of space and environments as these  affect women's daily lives and opportunities." The editors' goal, admirably carried  out, has been to produce a journal appealing to a range of readers, from feminist community activists to academics.  Funding, the perennial thorn in the side  of alternate publications, has been particularly difficult for Women and Environments. Its interdisciplinary focus, one of  the journal's major strengths, made academic support difficult to secure and Secretary of State Women's Program funding was  a long time coming. Happily, Women and  Environments is now a thriving quarterly,  jointly supported by the Centre for Urban  and Community Studies at the University of  Toronto and the Faculty of Environmental  Studies at York, with partial funding from  Sec State.  For those of us who have thought of  the environment only in terms of Nature  with a capital N, this journal comes as an  eye opener. Architecture, urban planning,  transportation, technology in the workplace, international development, delivery  of social services—a full range of issues concerning both the 'built' and the natural  environments are explored in these pages.  Although based in Canada, with extensive  North American coverage, Women and  Environments provides considerable international coverage as well.  The latest issue includes articles on eco-  feminism, women and international development, the current Canadian debate on  childcare, the feminist reshaping of urban services, a pioneer community child  care programme in San Francisco, Native  women's housing issues in Toronto and a  profile of Margherita Howe, Canadian environmental activist.  With the Spring 87 issue, Women and  Environments goes quarterly. The fourth  issue each year will be a Network issue, giving space to readers' concerns and activities;  it will include a subject index for the year.  Subscription rates are $9 per year for individuals.

Nov. 80 8:00 pm. Everywoman's Hall.  Admission free. Child care. Disabled  women need not apply.  Of course not!  Yet often, even usually, that's what the  publicity for feminist events say to disabled  women ... and you, the group responsible,  may not know it, want it, or expect it. Your  intentions may he, probably are (we hope)  good. But we all know what road is paved  with good intentions.  Your problem is usually that you just  plain don't know what accessibility is. Our  problem is that we can't get in to even tell  you.  Accessible means different things to different people. What follows is the bare  minimum for accessibility for most  disabled women. And remember disabled women are eighteen percent of all  women.  For a woman who uses a wheelchair, accessibility means no steps (a good ramp  and/or level entrance), an adapted washroom (with grab bars, a sink that her chair  will fit under, room to get the chair in the  cubicle and make a transfer sideways from  the chair onto the toilet), and a place to sit,  preferably with her friends.  For deaf and hearing impaired women,  access means sign language interpreters. It  means an office with a Telecommunications  for the Deaf (TDD) or a meeting with a loop  amplification device. (These things are not  as expensive or hard to get as you think.  Just ask your local DAWN group).  For blind and visually impaired women,  accessibility means having printed matter  (books, brochures, agendas, etc.) on cassette tape, in large print, or sometimes in  Braille. It means that her seeing eye dog is  welcome and that you don't pet or feed that  dog (it's working) without the owner's express permission. It means you offer to guide  a blind woman to her seat. You don't grab  her by the arm and drag her tAere.That's  not help; it's assault.  For developmentally disabled women,  your attitude and language are the key to  accessibility. When was the last time you  jokingly referred to someone as "an idiot,  imbecile, space cadet"? While we're on the  subject, how do you think severely mobility  impaired women feel about "basket case"?  Or deaf women about "dumb"? Or psychiatric survivors about feminists who call  other women "crazy, nuts, loony tuners, or  really out of it" Another cliche to watch is,  "Confined to a wheelchair". You don't usually think of yourself as confined to your  car even though you are incapable of travelling fifty miles an hour unaided. Of course  not, you drive your car. And we use our  wheelchairs (and crutches, canes, walkers,  etc.).  THE NATIONAL FILM BOARD IN ASSOCIATION WITH  THE DISABLED WOMEN'S NETWORK: B.C.

For most invisibly disabled women, those  whose disability you can't see, access is  often a matter of attitude and flexibility.  For a woman with epilepsy, it means no  strobe lights or flash bulbs. For a woman  with diabetes, it means nutrition breaks. We  thought non-disabled women liked to eat  too, but we have been to all-day feminist  events where no lunch break was planned.  (Is this the planning of a workaholic?)  For women with environmental illnesses,  access means smoke free meetings and  events. Yes Virginia, smoking is an equality  issue. If Mary dropped out of your planning  committee, it may mean that Mary had an  asthma attack after that last meeting from  your cigarette. Nice.  For some women accessibility means an  attendant to help her with her basic needs.  You will need to supply trained attendants  or she may want to bring her own attendant. If she does, the attendant should be  admitted to the event free of charge. An attendant is a technical aide in just the same  way as a wheelchair is and no one charges  two fares for a woman using a chair, one for  herself and one for her wheelchair.  Even when events are accessible, you may  not see disabled women out. This is sometimes because a community has no public  transit system for disabled users or, more often, because the system is inadequate. Most  transit systems for disabled people are separate and certainly not equal to regular transit systems. Users usually must book well in  advance and are not allowed to use transit  passes. Even though most disabled women  are the poorest of all women we must pay  full fare every time. On top of all this there  :  is no guarantee you'll get there. Or they  might (often) get you there an hour late or  pick you up an hour early. So much for spontaneity or last minute notices.  So disabled women may need a ride.  Someone, somewhere, somewhen, please,  please give DAWN our own wheelchair van.  If there's a goddess out there ...  Last, but never least, accessibility means  publicity. Organizers in the women's movement rarely seem to think of publicizing  events in the newspapers or on the phone  lines of the disabled movement. If you want  us at your event, or in your group, advertise  where we read.  And when you advertise events, every  event should have information about accessibility. If the event is not accessible to disabled women, it should say so.  Be specific. For example, "Hall wheelchair accessible. Bathroom not accessible."  And consult with DAWN. We know what's  accessible—and what isn't. We know how to  do it at the least expense and hassle. And  we're happy to be asked. We may even know  about funding if you ask us far enough in  advance.  At this point, maybe your heads are shaking and your finance committee is yelling,  it's not cost effective. (Perhaps the rest oi  you are simply saying, "It's too expensive").  Being disabled has never been cost effective and it never will be. The same  school of non-thought that calmly slaughtered millions of Jews, feminists, socialists,  gays and lesbians and other minorities, fed  us disabled people to the ovens because we  "cost too much".  Right here, today, in Canada, disabled  women are being sterilized without consent  because we "cost too much". The same argument is used to deny us jobs, decent incomes, housing, health care and everything  the non-disabled take for granted—because  it "costs too much".  But costs too much to whom? Why?  So forgive us if we retch when we hear the  same argument from feminist groups who  have not put accessibility at the top of their  agenda. And don't tell us that we're unreasonable, bitter, twisted and even strident  when you shut us out and can't cope with  our rage.  We must never, never, never shut any  women out. All women are equal. All belong in the women's movement. Or it's all a  big lie. You need to deal with your problem of excluding us. We won't go away.  We are your sisters. And we are organizing  around the world! Soon the spectacle of disabled women picketing inaccessible women's  events will become a reality. Every minority  has a point when collectively we say enough  is enough. We are no exception. We are  your sisters.

We envision a healing centre  at the entrance of an ecological, self sufficient village, which will be used for workshops and sessions on various holistic healing methods.  We have located an ideal, very private  thirty acres with two existing log buildings, year-round creek, two ponds, waterfalls, only an hour from Victoria.  Our goal is not to make this a heavy financial burden. Since the price is so low  (asking $63,000) and the land quite large  without any neighbors, we're hoping to attract enough womyn to pitch in initially  either by land memberships of $5,000 to  $8,000 or donations. Ten to twelve womyn  contributing in this way could make this  ours and hopefully set up the healing centre  as well (or more womyn contributing less of  course). There are also possibilities of finding grants for setting up the centre.  There is room for ten to fifteen simple  dwellings, rustic log structures in the woods  on a gentle southern slope with lots of privacy! There are plenty of timber and tools  could be shared for the building. Where else,  I ask you, could you secure yourself a little  peaceful spot in exclusively womyn's healing environment at that price on Vancouver  Island?  This would not be the place to invest  your dollars in hopes to make more money  (however, if the society folded, you would  get your money back). It means investing  in the idea of creating a womyn's space in  a healthy environment, where money will  have less and less meaning; where eventually you and me and the womoon with no  money can come and find the help she needs  in a nurturing place. The healing centre will  provide revenue for the society from workshops, and create salaries for the workers.  I am sensitive to the urgency to start  creating. I don't want to wait for tomorrow, but to use my resources now to create a  space with others, who feel a purpose to find  unity. We are searching for womyn who are'  ready to give a commitment (within their  means) to be there for one another to help  lighten the load, to help healing our wounds,  be they emotional, physical or spiritual.  What does my hard earned money in the  bank do for me now, I ask myself? What  good does it do me if and when all collapses,  including my body and sense of humour?  I am so tired of divisions after working  in the womyn's movement for over twelve  years. Of course, we are all different (which  I think is beautiful) and our souls are not  all on the same path. I see the challenge is  in learning from our past struggles how to  form a natural grouping of womyn with similar basic purposes and underlying motivations. Each womoon cherishing her own and  others freedom to be on their unique path  that goes to the same place—the heart!  I believe strongly that then we can work  it out, that we can survive and use our inner  and outer conflicts creatively for growth. I  am interested in moving forward—not running in circles, confronting the same problems over and over again.  Take a little time and think about it. If  you share any part of this vision, do contact  us now. Leave your name and phone number at 876-6038 and I'll get back to you.

African women  and AIDS  Kinesis  According to a report released in June  1987 by the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) about 50,000 Africans  are supposed to be carrying ADDS and the  disease has reached epidemic proportions in  Central, East and Southern Africa.  Many African nations are often outraged  and embarrassed when their countries are  associated with AIDS and have sometimes  refused to cooperate with women's groups  and organizations that makes such revelations to Western sources.  Zambia, for instance, has banned health  authorities and women's organizations from  sending any information on AIDS outside  the country, and Zimbabwe has refused to  assist with funding the projects or programmes of all women's bodies or organizations that release the latest figures of AIDS  carriers in the country to the outside world.  Kenya with 10,000 cases of AIDS has so far  continued to deny the existence of the magnitude of AIDS and has blamed Western  media for gross exaggeration of figures.  At the International AIDS Conference  held in June 1987 at Washington DC, a revelation was made by Dr. Robert Gallo, an  American ADOS specialist, that ten Nigerians were identified with a special AIDS  virus which he called "Nigerian Red Virus".  In the usual reaction of African governments over the association of AIDS with  their countries, the leader of the Nigerian  delegation at the conference, Dr. E. Essien,  became outraged with Dr. Callos' revelation  and emphatically denied the existence of the  "Nigerian Red Virus".  10%  OFF  UNTIL  SEPTEMBERS  1460 Commercial Drive  Phone 255-9559  Eastside DataGraphics is a collectively owned and operated storefront service in Vancouver's  East End.

Uganda, which has the greatest share of  AIDS victims in African, has opined that  "They saw no point in making people panic  when there is no risk of an epidemic."  Thus African nations continue daily to  deny the threat of this disease to the citizens  of their countries, so that their so-called national image abroad may not be tarnished.  Indeed, the refugee, famine and drought  problems are not of more threat to human  lives in Africa than AIDS. An Italian source  has revealed that an average AIDS patient  runs hospital bills roughly $110,000 which  could potentially bankrupt a country's public health system if the number surges.  What will become of the national economies  of the already impoverished countries of  Africa which develop a carefree attitude to  the existence of AIDS in their countries?  The USA budgetary allocation to AIDS  has risen from $5.5 million to $411 million  in the past five years. Britain has unleashed  a media blitz to alert and enlighten the public on the killer disease. The anxiety is much  the same throughout Europe and America;  but in Africa, the response has not matched  the problem by the least fraction.  The combined health care budget of all  Central African countries afflicted amounted to a paltry sum of $1 million in 1982,  and the figure for this year is hardly an improvement.  Coupled with this is a general reluctance  of governments to admit the enormity of  the problem. In addition, it is the sexual aspect of AIDS that has riveted public attention over the disease and it is not without  good cause. Sexual transmission is the most  common route; some sixty-five to seventy-  five percent of AIDS in Europe and America have occurred in homosexual men between twenty and forty years, and intravenous drug users who share hypodermic  needles.  The opposite is the case in Africa where  heterosexual intercourse and female genital mutilation have been the major routes  of AIDS. In Africa, women are noted carriers. In a survey recently concluded in  Uganda, of the 170 pregnant women tested  three quarters were found to have AIDS  and half of those infected were sexually mutilated. In Equatorial Guinea, of the one  hundred women who were tested seventy-  eight of them carried AIDS and sixty-five of  them were those whose genitals were mutilated. This has gone to prove Prof. Uli  Linke's research at the University of California, Berkeley, that female genital mutilation is one of the causes of the present epidemic of AIDS in Africa.  We of this centre have decided not to  fold our arms and wait for government's action against the deadly disease. We have  launched a massive campaign of education  and persuasion against female genital mutilation and the spread of AIDS by home visiting countryside enlightenment tours where  women are addressed in public places.  Our campaign uses literature, newspapers, radio and television. But our problem  is lack of funds to run the campaign and our  services as a non-government voluntary organization with limited funds.  We therefore, through your magazine, appeal to all feminists, womenfolk, women's  groups and organizations to come to our aid  by donating to our campaign fund in the interest of international feminism; for as Virginia Woolf said, "as a woman I have no  country ... as a woman my own country  is the whole world."

As we, VLC, sat down to try to refine  our own ideas about a women's building,  we came up with a list of questions that we  thought we needed to answer.  We're sending them out to everyone we  think might be interested so that women  will have a chance to do some thinking and  talking before the series of community meetings starts.  Needless to say, the list is probably not  complete, but we hope it will provide a  starting point for discussion.  We have booked VLC for 7:30 pm. on  Sunday, September 20th to report on the information we have so far and to begin discussions about what's next.  We're willing to chair the first meeting  and as part of that agenda will ask the meeting to decide about future chairs, meeting  place, structure of meetings, etc.  For copies of the questionnaire call VLC.

As lesbians and gay men, we all know how we are cut off from each other  and from the mainstream of society.    We fight isolation and invisibility to  come out and through our lives, especially in western Canada, where our  communities are smaller, cut off from media resources and more rural.  To support each other and strengthen our groups, we need information  about each other and about the issues and concerns we all face.   To  organize ourselves against the attacks of the right wing and groups like  REAL Women, we need to know what they are doing and how they will  affect us.  The women's presses give you some of this information, and Angles gives  you some as well. Angles wants to give you more. We want to give you  news and opinion about the lesbian and gay communities in the west that  you do not get anywhere else.  This month, Angles features an article on organizing for International  Lesbian Week.    Next week, we will cover the birthday of the Vancouver  Lesbian Centre.    We have presented articles on REAL Women and on on  the women's movement today as well as community events such as the  provincial lesbian and gay conference and lesbian/gay pride week.    You  will find something of interest in every section of Angles.  We need to ask for your support, however. We'd like you to subscribe to  Angles. You can pick up the paper at the Vancouver Lesbian Centre or  several other locations in Vancouver and western Canada. Or you can  subscribe and have every issue delivered to you for only $1.25 a month.  Just fill out the subscription form below and we'll send you Angles each  month.  We also need more lesbians to participate in the paper.    If you or  someone you know would be willing to write for us from time to time, at  whatever level you can, from news or opinion articles to calendar notes,  please contact us.    If you know places where Angles can be distributed to  make the paper more accessible to lesbians and gay men in the west,  please tell us.  With your help, Angles can be a useful tool in lesbian and gay liberation.  YES!    I'll help Angles support lesbians.    I'll subscribe.
