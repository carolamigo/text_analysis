Across the  country Everything seems to be happening  at the same time and so fast...to some extent,  it always feels that way at Kinesis: the deadlines chase each other and you get caught in  the middle of them...all. That doesn't seem  to be happening to women across the country who are organizing to put a stop to the  draconian (overused but apt word) cuts to  social policy Iseepage31, to immigration, or,  as we found out in Paul Martin's mini-  budget late last month, proposed cuts to just  about every social program, cuts that hit  women the hardest! We thought maybe  someone had discovered that 72-hour day  we are always whining about but, as we  investigated further, we found there is in  fact an incredible groundswell of solidarity  building among  women...workers...seniors...anti-racist and  anti-poverty activists...and and and...  About 34 actions across the country  protesting H uman Resources minister Lloyd  Axworthy's proposed social policy review  cuts are taking place as Kinesis goes to press.  Most of the actions were held on October  25th, 28th or 29th, organized by various  unions or women's groups...in St John's,  Nfld. in Halifax and Sydney, Nova  Scotia ...in Richibuctou, Moncton and  Fredericton, New Brunswick...in  Charlottetown and Montaque, PEL.in Montreal, Quebec...in Toronto,Guelph, Belleville,  Waterloo, Ottawa, Kingston, Windsor, London, St. Catherines, Stratford, Thunder Bay,  and Kenora, Ontario...in Winnipeg,  Manitoba...in Melville, Saskatoon and  Regina, Saskatchewan...in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta...and in Victoria, Prince  George and Vancouver, BC ...and in  Yellowknife, NWT.  These are only the actions we know  about; there were probably actions in other  towns or regions wedidn'thearabout. There  were leaflettings at soup lines, press conferences outside MP offices, rallies, guerilla  and street theatre, information booths, postcard campaigns, fax protests, and a costume  party (in Victoria, BC. The theme was "Nearly  dead." Participants marched to MP David  Anderson's office, then on to an AIDS housing grou p to join picket lines of workers who  have been on strike for 13 weeks.) InCalgary,  demonstrators handed out lemon candies  (Liberals leave a sour taste in the mouth), in  Halifax, MP Mary Clancy received a "pink  slip" from some constituents, and in Kingston, protestors actua lly found a hockey game  on (junior league) and leafletted  windshields...  Among actions planned for November  [some are listed in our Bulletin Board section]  are: a rally on November 4th in Guelph,  Ontario-noon in front of the CEC on  Wyndham St, with guerilla theatre and  leafletting; a coalition of seniors conference  "United Seniors to Protest Social Programs"  in Vancouver, at 411 Dunsmuir Street, with  about 1,000 organizations invited; a lesbian  and gay conference on social policy in Vancouver on November ..., and many more...  Concurrent with these protests, there  was a cross country action protesting Immigration ministerSergio Marchi's proposed  cuts to immigration, in particular, protesting the ministry's proposal to abolish the  Live-in Caregiver program  Intercede, the Toronto Organization for  Domestic Workers Rights and Vancouver's  Committee for Domestic Workers and  Caregivers Rights, West Coast Domestic  Workers Association, NAC-BC, the Women's Social Policy Coalition, and Philippine  Women's Centre, as well as organizations in  other cities, held protest marches on October 28th to demonstrate opposition to the  continuing discrimination against domestic  workers and immigrants of colour. We'll  have more on that next issue.  Intercede has also initiated a postcard  campaign, calling on Sergio Marchi to reform the Live-in Caregiver Program by removing the discriminatory conditions it currently imposes on domestic workers.  Marchi's proposals for changes to immigration legislation is due to be introduced in  the House of Commons early November.  To support actions against the changes, send  donations to Intercede, 489 College St, Suite  402, Toronto, Ont, M6G1A5, or to CWDCR,  727 East 38th Ave, Van, BC, V5W 1H9.  Also as Kinesis goes to press, about 150  women attended a conference on global  restructuring in Vancouver cosponsored by  UBC, OXFAM, Women to Women Global  Strategies, and others. We hear it was an  excellent conference, and we hope to have  more on it in the next issue. At strategy  sessions at the end of the Vancouver conference, women stressed the need to focus energies on new ways of reaching out into the  mainstream and of buildingalliances with a  broader range of groups. Among the more  concrete suggestions was to organize activism-skills building workshops, and to work  more with visual artists ("in order to reach  young people, we must recognize we are a  visually oriented society.")  Touching on similar issues raised at the  conference, in this month's paper [see page  11], Evelyn Zinanga writes about the impact  of global restructuring as it specifically impacts on women in Africa. And the latest  issue of Asian Women Workers Newsletter, an  excellent workers' paper published in Hong  Kong, focuses on the impact of global economic restructuring on women in Hong  Kong in a story on Hong Kong called "The  Invisible Unemployed—Women over 30s."  (The newsletter is available for in-house reference at the Vancouver Status of Women.)  As Kinesis goes to press, news is that the  Liberal government has finally put a dollar  and official commitment to reinstating the  Coaurt Challenges Program, as per their  election promise. The Program, which was  scrapped by the Tones in 1992, will get $2.7  million a year (the same when it was disbanded), to finance and advise equality-  seeking groups' court challenges under the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Previous  court challenges funded by the program  included the legal battle to return treaty  rights to Aboriginal women and efforts to  ensure free choice in abortions.  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

Finally, the Finance and Fundraising Committee would like to bid a fond farewell to  Alex Maas who is leaving after more than five years on the Committee. It is the dedication  of volunteers like Alex tha t keeps VSW thriving and we are very grateful indeed for all of her  hard work!  Last month, we said we would run a  feature on the "peace process" in  Ireland...things were unfolding so quickly,  there were daily changes and too many developments to write the story. We will bring  you that feature in the next issue. We arealso  working on features on the situation in Haiti  and in Cuba...  We hit a few snags with our feature on  Quebec (those pesky deadlines again) and  so decided to make it a two-parter. In Part  Two, we hope to run interviews again, including with Jackie Kistabish, president of  the Quebec Native Women's Association—  QN WA is holding its AGM in early November at which it will come up with strategies  for the upcoming "referendum" year.  In this issue, we review a couple of the  films [see pages 18-19] that screened at the  1994 Vancouver International Film Festival last month. Because the festival fell close  to Kinesis copy deadlines, we were unable to  review more films and hope to bring you  these next month. On the Festival though—  there seemed to be more cutting-edge political commentary (both in the documentary  and feature film categories) this year, most  of it outstanding.  New in Vancouver: a collective of individuals organizing against fascist skinheads  and neo-Nazi groups has set up an Info-line  inVancouvercalled"NoFootholdsforFas-  cism." The line is meant for people who  would like to to report or receive information on Nazi/Hate activities and anti-Nazi/  anti-Hate organizing. The number to call in  Vancouver is (604) 290-0409. This is not a  Help-line; an answering machine will record  messages, and someone may call you back.  That's it for this month. We've minutes  to make it to press, minutes to rest, and then  hopefully, many minutes (that 72-hourday?!)  to work on the news, features and reviews  we plan to bring you in our next issue...  Kinesis volunteers, Editorial Board members and staff got together in October for our  annual retreat. We looked back at our achievements over the last year, and discussed ways  to improve the content of the paper and the  processesat Kinesis. Suggestions ranged from  increasing the type size of the text and running more regular columns to broadening  representation of women from various com-  munitiesontheEditorialBoardandstrength-  ening our volunteer base through activities  such as consciousness raising meetings, social get-togethers, and production training  workshops. The sky was the limit—it was a  very clear day—on our brainstorming, and  many of the changes proposed are going to  take a little time and organization. We'll  keep you informed as we go along. We have  however decided to throw out the suggestion of the 72 hour day.  Welcome to our new writers this issue:  Evelyn Zinanga, Michelle Roy and Marie-  France Dubois, Feroza Ahmed, and Phoolan  Devi. And welcome to our new production  volunteers this issue: Noreen Kamal and  Rita Wong. If you're interested in writing or  doing production work, call us at 255-5499.  We'd love to have you.  See you next month.  Corrections  In our October issue, we misspelled  Magaly Varas' name in the bioline of the  centrespread interview with Patricia  Fernandez [page 13]. And on page 3, Cenen  Bagon was identified as a member of the  Vancouver Committee for Domestic Workers and Caregivers (VCDWC). She is with  the Vancouver Committee for Domestic  Workers' and Caregivers' Rights (CDWCR).  In the photo coverage of Take Back the Night  [page 11], we lost a bit of text identifying the  Pyrodesiacs, who performed at the rally.  We're working on getting a stickier brand of  wax.  Moving back an issue, in Coop Radio ad  in September, we incorrectly listed the times  for Obaa and the Lesbian Show, which had  changed. Obaa is on Tuesdays at 7pm, and  the Lesbian Show is on Thursdays at 8pm.  And finally, we need to correct our  "Corrections" from last month, as part of the  text didn't make it onto the page: Apologies  to Shree Mulay and Agnes Huang for a  mistake we made to their conversation on  the International Conference on Population  and Development [page 9]. The phrase, "because it violates and contradicts the basic  principles of feminism" should have been  tagged on to the end of Huang's question on  the declaration from the People's Perspectives on Population conference and not to  theendof the first paragraph of Shree Mulay's  response.  NOVEMBER 1994 News  Federal government's social policy review released:  From bad to worse  by Shannon e. Ash  Women's groups and other popular organizations are gearing up for the struggle  they predicted was coming following the  release of the Liberal government's review  of Canadian social policy last month. Up for  discussion are more funding cutbacks, more  loss of universality, and more erosion of the  rights of welfare and UI recipients.  The 89-page "discussion paper" was  releasedbyHumanResourcesMinister Lloyd  Axworthy on October 5. The consultation  process which preceded the paper began in  January. In February, the federal budget saw  cuts to Unemployment Insurance benefits  and welfare, continuing the tradition of previous Tory government cuts, which the Liberals had denounced only the year before.  Advocacy groups taking part in the consultation say the review is not being done in  good faith, but is driven by a Finance ministry eager to cut spending on social programs  to feed deficit payments.  The review covers Unemployment Insurance, Welfare and the Canada Assistance  Plan, Child Benefits, and Post-Secondary  Education—UI is solely a federal program,  while welfare and education are run by the  provinces but partly funded through federal  transfer payments. The review does not deal  with old age pensions, health care, and social spending forFirst Nations, which will be  dealt with in individual reviews.  Jean Swanson of Vancouver's End Legislated Poverty and current president of the  National Anti-Poverty Organization says the  consultation report does not reflect the views  of most groups who have already made  presentations to the government. The government's consultation process is to continue this month, coming to Vancouver November 16 and 17.  Most groups criticize the review document for its limited scope—not looking at all  aspects of the system, including the tax system and job creation—and its lack of analysis of the impact of these changes.  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC) says the review, for  exa m pie, doesn't recognize the link between  violence against women and access to social  programs. Access to income assistance and  housing are vitally important for women  trying to escape violence, says NAC president Sunera Thobani.  Julia Brooke of the Vancouver Women's Health Collective agrees, saying women's health also cannot be separated from  social policy. "If one's income cannot provide for safe, affordable housing, nutritious  food, and [safety] from violence," women's  health is in danger. Most women with disabilities already live well below the poverty  line, and need the support of social programs. Increased poverty and competition  could make First Nations struggles for land  rights more difficult.  Jeannette Armstrong, an activist from  the Okanagan nation, speaking at a Vancouver conference on women and global restructuring, said the struggle to maintain or  get back land use rights and prevent exploitation is being met with hostility "because of  the wage and labour economy...It means  jobs to cut down trees, it means jobs to clean  the rivers out of fish...Poverty [is used] to  create dependencies, and people are pitted  against each other."  A government document leaked just as  the review was released states the "real goal"  of the social policy exercise was to cut costs.  Human Resources m inister Lloyd Axworthy  says the document was only a briefing paper  and there was no evidence it came from the  Human Resources or Finance ministries, but  admitted that cuts were a "major reason" for  the proposals.  Finance minister Paul Martin, in a presentation made one week after the release of  the Social Policy Review discussion paper,  reiterated the emphasis on deficit reduction.  Martin says he is absolutely committed to  lowering the deficit by half by 1997, and is  focussing on spending cuts. Martin had said  earlier that raising taxes would be a "last  resort."  The government has no mandate to carry  out this program, says NAC's Thobani. "Consultation is a false process if we are only  offered options...which attack the most disenfranchised groups in society."  Child Benefits  In 1993, the Tory government  scrapped family allowances and replaced  them with child tax benefits. Now, the  review paper proposes limiting these benefits to low income families only. Payments to families who qualify as "low-  income" would be raised, supposedly to  help alleviate child poverty.  However, says Swanson, the proposed increase is "miniscule" and "won't  put a dent in child poverty."  A guaranteed annual income for low-  income families is also suggested in the  review, but is likely to be rejected as the  paper describes it as too costly.  The Liberal government's election  promise to create more daycare spaces  (150,000) when economic growth reaches  3 percent over three years is repeated in  the review, but no specifics are given.  What comes through though, says  Jocelyne Taugers of the National Child  Care Advocacy Association, is signs of a  "patchwork approach," and not a national  program.  NOVEMBER 1994  Welfare and CAP  Current formulas between the federal and provincial governments for sharing welfare costs may be "scrapped," and  the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP), which  ensures national standards for welfare,  may be replaced.  CAP standards, or rights, state that  any Canadian in need is entitled to money  for basic requirements, no matter which  province she is from, and that she should  not have to do work or training to receive  assistance. An appeal process is also guaranteed.  The loss of these standards "would  be a disaster," says Swanson, and the  attack on CAP is designed to force "employable" people off welfare, and single  parents into working poverty.  Workfare—making people work in  order to receive assistance—is another  suggestion in the review. A similar program is underway in Alberta right now.  At a national conference on women and  social policy held in Regina in September,  it was reported that Alberta health care  workers had been laid off after cuts. Their  positions, which paid $12-$14/hr, were  replaced by jobs paying $6 to $6.50/hour  which people on welfare had to apply for  if they wanted to receive assistance [see  Kinesis, Oct 1994 for more on Alberta cuts].  Social program costs contribute less than  six percent to the deficit increase. Both NAC  and ELP point out that the deficit is largely  caused by interest rates and unpaid corporate taxes. Canada's corporate tax rate, which  has been steadily declining, is one of the  lowest among the industrialized countries.  ELP has called for higher corporate taxes.  Swanson says the social policy review is  part of a "cheap labour strategy" to force  people to accept low wages and fewer rights  [see Kinesis, Jul/Aug 1994].  This strategy is part of a global agenda,  according to Nandita Sharma of Women to  Women GlobalStrategies."It'sa policy that's  being decided at an international level between states at meetings of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development) and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)," she points out.  Nations are under pressure to "restructure their workforces" for the benefit of  highly mobile capital. In essence, Sharma  says, it is a Structual Adjustment Program—  something people in many developing countries have been suffering from for some time.  The guest-worker program in Canada  is an example of the kind of model preferred  for the workforce, says Sharm a. Guest work-  Post-Secondary Education  The government proposes to end federal cash grants to provinces for post-  secondary education. These payments  account for 25 percent of current post-  secondary funding; another 25 percent is  paid by students as tuition fees. These cuts  would mean that tuition fees would at  least double.  The government proposes to replace  cash transfers with a loan fund, which will  be available to all, and would be repayable depending on income after graduation, unlike the current student loans program. Some grants for "low-income" students are possible.  While an "income contingent" loan  fund might sound like a good idea, says  Michelle Renter, BC Chair of the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS), the  proposal is "completely flawed." The minimum student debt load would be $40,000.  Loan payments would be a per-year  amount based on one's taxable income for  that year. Those who get jobs in the higher-  paying sector will pay off their loans more  quickly and thus pay less interest. Those  with the lowest incomes will end up paying the most.  Payments will be deferred if unemployed, but interest will continue to build  up. Women are more likely to be in the  lower-paid job sector, or to take time off  work to raise children. Renter says that it  could take up to 36 years to pay off a loan,  and women would be unable to save for  future needs, such as housing or retirement—or more education, given the government's proposal that people pay for  their own job retraining through a tax-  sheltered savings program (similar to  RRSPs).  The alternative to the government's  proposal, says Kenter, is a "truly progressive tax system." Corporations should contribute, through the tax system—CFS proposes a one percent tax to go directly to  post-secondary education. The rightwing  argues that only individuals benefit from  education. Kenter disagrees. "It is society  that benefits from post-secondary graduates."  ers have no union rights, are not protected  under labour legislation, and have no access  to social programs.  Sharma says the social policy review is  connected to the immigration review, also  currently under way. Domestic workers, for  example, may lose the right to apply for  landed immigrant status [see Kinesis, Ocf  1994, and pages 9-10, this issue]. Employers  can bring in guest workers and pay them  less, undercutting other workers. This allows the targeting of immigrants as scapegoats.  The Liberal government cites polls that  show 85 percent of Canadians believe social  policies are in need of reform as evidence of  support for their social security review.  Many women have been arguing for  reform for years—but it's not the kind the  government is proposing. Says Swanson,  "You can take a bad system and make it  better, or you can make it worse." This is  worse.  Unemployment Insurance  There are two proposals to change  the UI system. The first cuts back on the  current program, making it harder for  people to qualify for benefits by increasing the length of time and hours one has to  work to qualify; and reducing the level  and duration of all benefits. And while  currently, eligibility for UI is adjusted depending on an area's employment level—  in high unemployment areas, one needs to  less workto qualify—under this proposal,  eligibility may be standardized across the  country.  The second proposal is to create a  two-tiered system. People who only occasionally claim UI will have a system similar to the current one. People who claim  UI frequently—more than three times in  five years, according to one figure—will  have reduced insurance, possibly tied to  "family income"—that is, if a partner or  family member is earning income, the  benefits given to the unemployed person,  often a woman, may be limited depending on this income.  As well, training and "community  service" will be emphasized—those who  refuse may get reduced or no benefits.  Frequent claimants (and employers) may  have to pay higher UI premiums.  Women will be adversely affected,  both by general cuts and the two-tiered  system as women tend to be frequent UI  claimants—many work in insecure employment sectors, as seasonal workers in  fish plants or tourism, and as temporary  and contract workers.  Tying UI to "family income" will take  away women's autonomy and increase  their dependence on men, according to  NAC president Sunera Thobani.  There is also a proposal to "top up"  low-paying jobs for about 50,000 Canadians on UI for up to two years, to encourage  them to accept work that pays less than  their previous jobs—in effect, wage subsidies to employers.  The proposals seem to be based on  themyththatUI premiums are "too high"  and discourage job creation. ELP's Jean  Swanson however points out that UI is  actually one of the few programs where  employers contribute to social costs. Government subsidies to employers are what  Swanson describes as part of a move to  "get individual taxpayers to pay business  costs." What's news  Update on the child  support tax policy  Women are waiting for the Supreme  Court to rule on a landmark case that challenges federal laws requiring women to pay  income tax on child support payments.  "Thousands of women are waiting for  this decision," SuzanneThibaudeau told reporters in Ottawa after lawyers argued her  case before seven judges in early October.  Thibaudeau, a Quebec woman who has  been fighting the unfair tax law since 1989,  won a lower court ruling in May that taxing  the child support payments was discriminatory. But the federal government appealed  that ruling to the Supreme Court, and other  similar cases have been adjourned until the  Thibaudeau case is settled [see Kinesis, fune  1994 and July/August 1994].  Thecurrenttaxation system means that,  in 1991 for instance, women paid about $330  million in taxes on child support payments,  while men got tax breaks totalling more than  $660 million.  On October 4, the Supreme Court hearings on Thibaudeau's case ended. It could be  several months before the court hands down  a ruling.  In Ottawa, several of the judges questioned the arguments made by lawyers representing Thibaudeau and a coalition of  women's and poverty groups granted  intervenor status insupport of Thibeaudeau.  Later, Thibaudeau told reporters the  law must change no matter what decision  the judges make. "I'd like them to come and  live the lives of women and children, come  and see we live that discrimination every  day for years," she said. "I'm convinced the  law has to change."  Meanwhile, a federal government committee continues to study the child support  system. Sheila Finestone, committee chair  and secretary of state for the status of women,  said the government isn't close to a solution.  "We don't have a package ready yet at all,"  Finestone said in early October.  Karlene Faith  wins VanCity Prize  Unruly Women: The Politics of Confinement and Resistance, written by Karlene Faith  and published by Press Gang Publishers,  has won this year's VanCity Book Prize.  "I hope this work helps demystify the  women behind prison walls and encourages  people to rethink the way we punish people  for their transgressions against social order," Faith said, after winning the $4,000  award, BC's largest literary prize.  Faith, a Simon Fraser University criminologist, has been a community activist for  human justice since the mid-1950s. She began advocacy work with women prisoners  in 1972, and later co-founded the Santa Cruz  Women's Prison Project, which offered university courses, cultural workshops and artistic performances to women prisoners in  California.  "It's my hope that the publicity this  award generates will contribute to broader  public a wa reness and political action in support of women whose lives are mangled by  the pains of social injustice," she added.  "The strength of this book is not only its  scholarly analysis but its activist approach,"  said author Jane Rule,oneof the three women  who judged the entries for this year's prize.  As part of the award, the winner designates $1,000 to a women's charity. Faith has  chosen Strength In Sisterhood, a newly-  formed group of former women prisoners  who are setting up a program to help incarcerated women with their transition back  into society after release.  The other finalists for this year's prize  are Sharon Brown's Some Become Flowers,  Anita Robert's The Last Clmnce Cafe, and  MAC Farrant's Raw Material.  Little Sister's  goes to court  An impressive line-up of supportersare  testifying for Little Sister's during the court  case now underway in Vancouver.  After years of delay, the court case finally began October 11. The Vancouver lesbian and gay bookstore and the BC Civil  Liberties Union filed suit against Canada  Customs in 1990 to challenge book seizures  at the Canada-US border.  During the trial, expected to last at least  six weeks, a wide range of witnesses are  testifying for Little Sister's. Among the 27  witnesses are Vancouver artist Persimmon  Blackbridge, novelist Jane Rule, Duthie Books  owner Celia Duthie, Sandra Haar of the  Toronto Women's Bookstore, and US authors Pat Califa and Sarah Schulman.  Others who have testified include Canadian author Pierre Berton, Professor Anne  Scales of the University of New Mexico  School of Law, and Jearid Moldenhaur, the  founder of Glad Day Books in Toronto and  Boston. Moldenhaur will testify with respect  to the early days of Glad Day and the problems encountered with Canada Customs  from 1974 to 1990.  The case is also receiving support from  PEN Canada, the Canadian Writers' Union  anti-censorship group, and the Women's  Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF).  LEAF sent a letter to the minister of National  Revenue, who is responsible for Canada  Customs, focussing on Customs Canada's  discrimination against lesbians in its actions  against the bookstore.  LittleSister's is arguing theCanada Custom s Act viola tes the Charter of Rights' freedom of expression clause by empowering  Customs to detain and seize books it deems  to be violating the Criminal Code's obscenity act.  The bookstore's lawyer Joseph Arvay is  also seeking to establish that Canada Customs deliberately discriminates against gay  and lesbian bookstores, since other bookstores carry many of the materials that have  been seized en route to Little Sister's bookstore. In her testimony, Celia Duthie will  testify that Duthie Books, a major Vancouver bookstore, ordered a shipment of books  identical to one ordered by Little Sister's.  Duthie'sshipmentarrived untouched, while  the shipment destined for Little Sister's was  seized.  The federal government does not dispute Little Sister's argument that the seizures infringe on their Charter rights to freedom of expression, but is arguing that, because the seized materials violate the Criminal Code, Customs Canada's actions are  justified.  As in the months leading up to the trial,  Canada Customs' harassment of the bookstore has continued if not increased, resulting in seizures of books that do not even  involve obscenity laws, like the seizure of  the children's book Belinda's Bouquet [see  Kinesis, Oct 1994].  Meanwhile, Little Sister's continues to  fundraise to finance the costs of the case. To  date, the store's legal costs have risen to over  $200,000.  supreme  Court of  Canada  protect* i  drunk   /  rapists  DEMONSTRATION AGAINST SUPREME COURT RULING  by Sue Vohanka   Women in Vancouver rallied on October 6th to protest a recent Supreme Court  ruling that allows a man to use "extreme drunkenness" as a defence in a sexual  assault case.  The rally outside Vancouver's law courts was organized by Women Against  Violence Against Women Rape Crisis Centre (WAVAW) within days of the  Supreme Court decision.  "The implications of this case are going to be more men getting away with  beating, raping, harassing and killing women because they were drunk, while  less women will report because they know the criminal justice system is not for  them, but for men," said Zara Suleman of WAV AW.  "All this talk in the media, government, and legal system about violence against  women, when really nobody cares that women's rights are being taken away,  she added.  The Supreme Court ruled that a Montreal man can use drunkenness as an excuse  for raping a 65-year-old woman in a wheelchair. The court ordered a new trial for  the man, who argued he was too drunk to have formed the criminal intent  required for a conviction.  "This is just another disgusting example of once again how the courts fail to  protect women from being assaulted," said Miche Hill, of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women.  "We need some training and education within the court system," Hill told  Kinesis. "There's just too much of a bias in the system against women who've  been assaulted. It's not going to get any better until they start taking sexual  assault seriously, until society starts treating sexual assault as the crime it is.  inistcr XX/isdom  A Journal for the Lesbian Imagination  in the Arts and Politics since 1976  Great Issues full of terrific dyke writing and art  agitate, soothe, inspire, move us to reflection and action:  #35 On Passing  #36 On Surviving Psychiatric  Assault/Creating Emotional  Well-Being in Our Communities  #37 Lesbian Theory  #38 Lesbian Relationships  #39 On Disability  #40 On Friendship  #41 Italian-American Women's Issue  #42 Open theme (12/90)  #43/44 15th Anniversary  Retrospective (6/91)  #45 Lesbians & Class (12/91)  To get this great work sent to your  home, your office, your friends —  SUBSCRIBE NOWI  Name  __^  Address      ■        City     '           State & Zip   Subscription rates  1 yr, 4 issues  $17 1 year, $30 2 years  International: $22 f$US)  Single issues: $6 (postage inc.)  POB 3252 • Berkeley, CA 94703 • USA  NOVEMBER 1994 News  New Code of Conduct at SFU:  School silences students  by Teresa McCarthy  and wendy lee kenward  Student activists at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Vancouver have formed a  coalition to fight new policies that could be  used to restrict the rights of students to protest and organize on campus.  InJuly,SFU'sSenate, the university body  which governs aca demic activity, approved a  set of policies and procedures designed to  ensure student discipline. These regulations  include a new Student Code of Conduct,  which students fear will limit student activism.  Maya Russell, a member of the steering  committee for the newly formed Student Anti-  Code Coalition, says the Code of Conduct  "written by the Senate with very little student  input, puts in place some pretty tough enforcement policies."  The Code of Conduct, which was once a  short description that informed students of  their responsibilities under law to the university community, is now a detailed description of what the university deems "unacceptable" student behaviour.  The aims of the new Code are to "define  students' basic responsibilities as members  of the academic community, to define inap-  ...one such "code" in  the department reads:  "No student  shall deface any  University building  or property."  propriate student conduct, and to provide  procedures and penalities to be invoked and  applied if they engage in such unacceptable  behaviour."  "The president used to have the right to  expel students under the British Columbia  College and University Act at his discretion,  so in one way, the code is supposed to make  [penalization]...less arbitrary," says Russell.  "It also has a much more detailed appeals  procedure than the one in place previously,  so on the face of it, it might not look too  unreasonable."  The code includes and emphasizes actions addressed by the criminal code, such as  trespassing, fraud and theft. However, one  such "code" in the document reads: "No  student shall deface any University building  or property." This could be used against  progressive students who choose grafitti as a  form of communication with other students.  Laura Atkinsonof the SimonFraserPub-  lic Research Interest Research Group (SF-  PIRG) says that "the recentgraffitti campaign  done by women for women on campus was  erased, yet homophobic, racist graffitti isnever  taken on by the administration, so what are  they really protecting?"  Some sections of the Code in particular,  such as one entitled "Misconduct," that sets  out "inappropriate student conduct," have  raised concern among members of SFU's  student community.  Referring to a statement in the Code that  says, "No student shall by word or action  disrupt university activity," SF-PIRG's  Atkinson says this could be used to violate  the right of students to gather, protest, speak  out against the status quo, and of the unions  to organize picket lines.  The difference between SFU's Code of  Conduct and the codes at universities like the  University of Victoria and Queen's University in Kingston, says Maya Russell, "is that  SFU's code deals not only with academic  behaviour but also lim its where students can  go and what they can do."  Despite the risks of student organizing  following the new Code of Conduct's adoption, studentsareorganizingagainsttheCode.  Concerned studentsand representatives from  groups as diverse as the Teaching Support  Staff Union (TSSU), the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS), SF-PIRG, and the stu-  Leake says the Code comes at a time  when SFU's cam pus is relatively quiet. "The  administration wants to put [the Code]  through now because they want the power  to deal with people who get out of line  later," she says. Leake points out that issues  like sexual harassment and date rape are  heating up on some US and Canadian campuses and that these and issues of academic  freedom will probably explode on most  Canadian campuses in the near future.  Leake adds the Code also perpetuates  the "so-called apathy" among Canadian  students and their unwillingness to get involved in activism because it speaks directly to their fear that activism will put bad  marks on their record and therefore make it  more difficult for them to find jobs.  The Code is designed to make students  "less likely to become vocal, more likely to  become part of the corporate world," she  You Can erdse. rtejraWiH  Zoo can never erase, iht m&  "The Writings on the Wall"— Grafitti at SFU  dent Senators who were on summer leave  when the Code was passed have come together to form the Anti-Code Coalition.  Nazmin Bhatia, of the Simon Fraser Students' Society, says it is crucial the student  body be aware tha t many students are organizing together over this issue. "Students  should know that this [activism and organizing] works all the time."  The Coalition's Russell says one possibility of getting the Code revoked is by mobilizing the SFU student community around  the question of the Senate's right to pa ss such  a code.  "If there was significant public pressure, and if the document became  embarassing for the administration, there  might be some movement. That's why it is so  important also for people who do not go to  SFU to know about this," says Russell.  To increase awareness both on and off  SFU's campus, and to build public pressure  on the administration, the Coalition is setting  up events such as an Anti-Code open stage  night on campus, and giving interviews to  the media. The Coalition has established three  working groups to organize such events and  to research, publicize, and agitate around  discriminatory issues in the Code.  SFU's student newspaper, The Peak, is  closely following the student activities protesting the Code of Conduct. This semester,  the paper has run stories on the changes to  the Code, corporate funding at universities,  SFU's campus security, and the academic  freedom backlash. As The Peak's news coordinator Sophie Leake points out, "all these  issues are connected."  says. And because professors "already have  academic freedom," the code further "silences student challenges and new ideas  and protects the privileges of those in positions of power."  Laura Atkinson agrees, pointing out  that "The Code's policies contradict the  Canadian Human Rights Code," especially  in sections that limit student participation  in the issues that affect them.  Protests and public gatherings have  long been tools of demanding changes in  the status quo for disenfranchised groups.  Oncampuses, protest and alternafive forms  of information sharing are sometimes the  only avenues available to students by which  to challenge the actions of administration.  Under the Code, Atkinson says, what  the university may deem "disruptive behaviour" might actually be the student's  right to challenge the university canon.  "If you look at it from a feminist perspective around protecting human rights,  this Code targets one of the least protected  groups on campus...Students are not protected by unions, faculty associations or  tenure. If we contextualize this with the  documented human rights abuses at the  university, the majority have happened by  those with power," says Atkinson.  Most student activists say the increase  in conservativism on SFU's campus coincides with the increase in corporate co-  sponsorship of SFU in the 90's. One example of such sponsorship is the substantial  funds given towards the building of the  downtown campus of SFU by multinational corporations such as MacMillan  Bloedel.  The move towards soliciting greatercor-  porate funding also comes at a time of government cutbacks in spending on education,  increased tuition costs for Canadian and  international students, a decrease in scholarship monies and bursaries, lack of subsidies  for single mothers, and cutbacks in student  spaces, such as common rooms, and student  resources, such as computers.  Russell is particularly concerned about  the effects corporate funding will have on  public accessibility to an education. "You  have to seriously question what effect corporate involvement will have on who gets  into universities, academic freedom and on  the mandate of the university," she says.  "These changes  are about  making the campus  safe for  capitalism."  -Laura Atkinson-  "Corporations certainly don't care about the  issues that women students face, such as  lack of accessibility, poverty, and harassment."  Atkinson points out that a lack of policies regarding admissions contributes to a  situation where "getting into the university  tends to be accessible only to those who have  more money."  She says that, "Traditionally, women  have had to fight their way into academia,  and in many ways that's what being a feminist at university is all about. Our job is to  make trouble and to continue to open doors."  The cutting edge of political activism on  campus currently tends to be the women's  centre on campus. As well, most student  activists tend to be women.  Atkinson cites sexual harassment, assault, and the misogyny, homophobia and  racism in the curricula, as well as of professors and students, as some of the issues  women are raising on campus.  "Because these are potentially the most  threatening issues to the administration, as  women we should be really worried about  the new Code," she says.  "At a time when First Nations, African  Americans, gays and lesbians and other  underacknowledged groups in general are  demanding that curricula, departments and  universities reflect more diverse realities,  universities in North America are all passing  codes of conduct and similar regulations to  ensure the status quo which is based on  euro-centric traditional elitism," says  Atkinson.  "These changes are about making the  campus safe for capitalism," says Atkinson,  "but what that means for students is that  they are basically taking away our voice for  social change."

WomenFutures Community Economic  Development Society has provided education, research assistance, and consulting services for women and women's groups in  British Columbia and Canada since 1985.  The society also operates a Loan Guarantee  Fund that assists women to obtain credit for  initiating or expanding group-oriented  projects.  In Women Get Credit, WomenFutures  offers four alternative strategies based on  research that shows women experience discrimination and rejection when trying to-  access credit through conventional institutions such as banks.  The four strategies are Savings Groups,  Lending Circles, Barter Systems, and Loan  Guarantee Funds. Women Get Credit presents  information on each alternative, how each  can get started, benefits and limitations, and  suggestions about where to find more information. Each section provides practical information about developing alternative  financing strategies to enable groups to discover which strategy is appropriate for their  goals and needs. There is also a sample  document attached to each section to give  readers an idea of how groups do their  work, and lists of names and addresses of  organizations that are willing to share infor-  mation and provide resources for new initiatives are given at the end of each section.  Women Get Credit is available through  WomenFutures, 217-1956 West Broadway,  Vancouver, BC, V6J 1Z2 or by calling (604)  737-1338. The kit costs $8 plus $3 postage for  individuals or $10 plus $3 postage for groups  and organizations.

Call for longer sexual  assault sentencing  The Fernie Women's Resource Centre  in Fernie, British Columbia, is circulating a  petition to be sent to the House of Commons  calling for Parliament to amend section 271  of the Criminal Code so that it include a  minimum sentence of five years where a  person pleads guilty to or is found guilty of  a Level One Sexual Assault.  Level One Sexual Assault presently carries a rr 'ximum penalty of ten years. However, Canadian courts give an average sentence for Level One Sexual Assault of only  six months and 90 percent of sexual assault  perpetrators receive a sentence of less than  two years.  The petitioncites tha tone in four worn ^n  will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime,  that every six minutes a woman in Canada is  sexually assaulted and that every seventeen  minutes a woman in Canada is raped.  The Fernie Women's Resource Centre  petition was issued following the December  1993 case in Elk Valley where a man sexually  assaulted his ex-girlfriend three times and  threatened to murder her. He pleaded guilty  and then received an 18-month sentence, a  sentence the Fernie Women's Resource  Center doesn't think is adequate.  For copies of the petition, write to Fernie  Women's Centre, Box 2054, Fernie, BC, V0B  lM0,orcall (604) 423-4687. Completed petitions are due back at Fernie Women's Centre  by December 15.

The campaign is coordinated by the  Centre for Women's Global Leadership in the  United States.  During previous 16 Days campaigns,  women have organized events to challenge  the invisibility of women's human rights locally and globally. Campaigns have included  more than 120 countries and events included  petition drives, speakouts, hearings, vigils,  rallies, film festivals, newsletters, magazines,  posters, T-shirts and buttons.  The 1994 16 Days, using the slogan  "Awareness, Accountability, Action: Violence  Against Women Violates Human Rights,"  will focus attention on the violence associated with violations of women's reproductive health, and will highlight outcomes from  the recent Interna tional Conference on Population and Development in Cairo.  As well, women in Asia, Africa and the  Caribbean are currently organizing hearings  around issues such as domestic violence, trafficking in women, and violence against  women who are dispossessed following the  death of a spouse. In addition, hearings will  be convened at the UN World Conference on  Women in Beijing in September 1995.  A number of annual events in different  countries fall within or are part of the 16  Days. November 25 is International Day  Aga inst Violence Aga inst Women, decla red  by the First Feminist Encuantro for Latin  America and the Caribbean in 1981 in Bogota, Columbia.

Report on  electoral systems  The Canadian Advisory Council on the  Status of Women (CACSW) has produced a  document called Electoral Systemsand Representative Legislatures: Consideration of Alternative Electoral Systems. The report was  commissioned in order to determine which  electoral systems are most likely to achieve  outcomes thatarerepresentativeof the population and to generate discussion on ways to  increase the representation of women and  minorities in the House of Commons.  The report is intended for members of  parliament, policy-makers, women's groups,  and others evaluating the Canadian electoral system and its present failure to adequately represent women and minorities.  To obtain a free copy of the report, write  to the CACSW at 110 O'Connor Street, 9th  floor, Box 1541, Station B, Ottawa, Ontario,  KIP 5R5, or call (613) 992-4975, or fax (613)  992-1715.  CACSW report on  taxing child support  The Canadian Advisory Council on the  Status of Women (CACSW) has produced a  document called Tax Treatment of Child Support: Preferred Policy Options, which was the  CACSW's submission to the recent federal  Task Group on the Tax Treatment of Child  Support.  The brief approaches the taxation of  child support payments from an integrated  perspective, looking at the combined impact  of income tax, family law, and income security policies. The brief also notes that the  present tax system does not work satisfactorily for many custodial mothers.  The CACSW makes several recommendations in the brief, including calling for the  repeal of the deductibility of child support  payments from the payor's taxable income  as well as the repeal of their inclusion in the  recipient's taxable income. The CACSW also  recommends thatnon-custodial parents who  make child support payments in the year in  which they are due should be entitled to a  limited refundable tax credit.  The CACSW was set up in 1973 by the  federal governmenton the recommendation  of the Royal Commission on the Status of  Women in Canada. The CACSW is composed of a maximum 30 members appointed  by the federal Cabinet.  To obtain a free copy of the brief, write  to the CACSW at 110 O'Connor Street, 9th  floor, Box 1541, Station B, Ottawa, Ontario,  KIP 5R5, or call (613) 992-4975, or fax (613)  992-1715.

NOVEMBER 1994 Feature  Feature  Interview with Shree Mulay on the ICPD conference in Cairo:  More on population  Less on development  as told to Agnes Huang   The United Nations World Conference on  Population and Development (ICPD) took place  in Cairo, Egypt, September 5-13. The ICPD was  comprised of two concurrent forums—one for  government representatives from UN member  countries, one for non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  Twomonths ago,Kinesis interviewed Shree  Mulay, who was on her way to Cairo to attend  the ICPD's NGO Forum as the representative of  the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC). Mulay-has also been involved  with the South Asian Women's Centre in Montreal. Here, Mulay talks with Kinesis about  what took place at the conference.  Agnes Huang: When I interviewed you  before you went to the ICPD in Cairo, you  said you had mixed feelings about what  would come out of the conference. How do  you feel now about what happened in Cairo?  Shree Malay: I still have mixed feelings.  The Plan of Action that came out of the Cairo  conference is a departure from those of the  two previous UN conferences on Population and Development in that it made a great  attempt to put women in the centre. It recognized that, if one could raise the status of the  woman herself, that might in fact result in a  reduction in the number of children that the  woman has.  On the other hand, when it comes down  to the actual budget applications, the figures  reveal that the people who are the movers  andshakersbehindtheconferencearestillin  the family planning mode. Sixty-five percent of the $17 billion which was identified  for the execution of the Cairo Plan of Action  over five years is allocated for family planning. That means the part of the program  which calls for education for women, fighting HIV/AIDS, and so on, only gets 35  percent of the budget.  When I raised this at the forum of government delegates, I was told it was easier to  work out the amount of money needed to be  promote family planning programs, but they  had no idea how much it would cost for  promoting reproductive health for women.  So with one program, they had firm numbers; with the other, they didn't. I don't  accept this argument because, if you are  trying to demonstrate that this Cairo Plan is  a departure from the others before it, then  this departure should be reflected in the kind  of budget you project, even if you're wrong  about it. Politically, the budget has to reflect  reality.  Huang: Can you elaborate a bit on what  is in the Plan that is positive for women?  Mulay: Chapter Four talks about the  empowerment and status of women. It talks  about how to raise the status of women, and  addresses the need, for example, for establishing mechanisms for equal participation  and representation. It talks about ending  violence against women and other issues  that you can find in previous UN documents  such as the Declaration on the Elimination of  Violence against Women of 1979 as being  essential to raising the status of women.  In specific, the document addresses the  need to eliminate all practices that discriminate against women, in terms of reproductive rights and access to reproductive and  sexual health. There is a specific section on  genital mutilation, for example, which I  thought is an important landmark in this  particular Plan. So from this perspective,  empowerment of women is situated as a  core of this document.  When it comes to aspects such as development, the document is weak. We heard  this at the NGO forum over and over again.  I.was hearing from women that the main  problem they face in achieving equality is  basic survival and that survival depends on  eliminating poverty. What is absolutely  crushing women is that they are not able to  get work and when they do, their status is  very low.  The second concern about women's reproductive rights is that, while all targets  [for population reduction] have been eliminated in this document—there are no targets  mentioned except that of trying to reduce the  fertility rate of women over a period of  time—because more money has been put  into the family planning program, this may  lead to two negative outcomes.  One is reduction in funds for the family  health care services. For example, there was  a woman at the International People's Hearing at the conference who said that, when  she went to her family health clinic, she  beca use she said she was 32 years old but she  looked older than I, and I'm in my 50s. She  agreed to the tubal ligation because of her  poverty, but when she got sick, the clinic  would not help her. There were many testimonies from women of such brutality.  One strong sense I came away with was  that the ICPD Program of Action does not  guarantee sufficiently that these kinds of  abuses will be eliminated from population  policy programs that have always had this  history of abuse in the past.  The chapters of the Program that got the  most publicity were Seven and Eight because they were opposed by the Vatican...  Huang: ...and because they dealt with  abortion?  Mulay: Abortion was one of the issues.  The Vatican did not want to directly or indirectly endorse abortion in any shapeor form,  evenifitwasdoneto trea t the consequences  of unsafe abortion.  "I somewhat disagree with people-  that the abortion issue  took too much time at the ICPD."  could have a selection of any number of  contraceptives but could not get access to  aspirin—which she needed because she had  a fever. Because more money is being put  into family planning programs, there may  be more of this disparity, where basic needs  are not met but contraceptives are available.  The other thing is more monies for family planning could result in greater coercion  of women. I heard, for example, women  from Brazil and Bangladesh talk about the  brutal ways in which these family planning  programs actually work in the rural areas  and the fields, where they become another  way of subjugating women. So there was  concern that the human rights of women  may be violated, despite the positive words  in the document.  One of the proposals that came out of  ICPD's Women's Caucus was that there  needs to be a monitoring system, an ICPD  Watch by women as a group from around  the world to make sure that the ICPD programs do not in fact result in this kind of  coercion of women.  Huang: Women from the South had  planned to bring forward stories of women  who had been abused by coercive population control policies. Was it at the International Peoples' Hearing that they did this?  Mulay: There were two such hearings.  The other, which I didn't attend, was organized by the Committee for Global Leadership, a US-based organization.  The one I was a part of included women  from Brazil and Bangladesh, organizational  presentations from India, and testimonies  by women with disabilities from Japan and  Zimbabwe. The women with disabilities, for  example, talked about how their rights are  not really recognized, how their disabilities  are used as a reason by people who tell them  they cannot have children, or what kind of  contraception they should use or even to  coerce them into having hysterectomies [surgical removal of uterus].  Then there was a woman from Bangladesh who agreed to be sterilized in return for  a little money, but the tubal ligation was  done in such a brutal way, she became sick.  Actually, I almost wept when I saw her  clause on young people than on the abortion  issue.  The other big debate was around recognition of other kinds of relationships between people. The Catholic Church was not  the only one opposing the possibility that the  document might sanction or recognize same-  sex couples—the Islamic countries were  strong in making sure that notion was not  accepted.  tk> To HZo-     ,  MOTo  POPULATION  CG^TrZoL-H  I somewhat disagree with many people  who said subsequently that the abortion  issue took too much time at the ICPD, and  jthere was not enough time spent on, let's  say, development issues. In fact, I don't  think it was part of the conference organizers' plans to focus on development issues  anyway, even though many countries  brought those issues up.  This debate at the ICPD was really a  struggle for the repudiation of the 1984  Conference on Population. I think the Vatican needed to defend what they won at the  1984 conference, when the Vatican, together  with the US government which was led by  Ronald Reagan, made the abortion provisions very restrictive, so that a country in  which abortion was legal could not qualify  for aid from the US government.  With the change in the US government  [now under Bill Clinton's Democrats], the  Vatican's defence was not only its traditional position, but was also a kind of struggle for leadership globally in this particular  area. In that sense, the Vatican did lose, even  though people claim everybody won in the  end.  But abortion has not been an issue in the  South as it has in the North because women,  whether abortion is legal or illegal, continue  to die—all abortions done in third world  countries are done in unsa fe conditions, even  in India where abortion is legal. Women die  from abortions because they don't have access to safe abortion conditions. But the issue  of US aid being tied to whether a country  legalizes abortion was important and in that  sense, women won.  But I think the Vatican's real resistance  was to the notion of what constitutes reproductive rights and reproductive health. One  of the biggest debates was with respect to  young people, around recognition of parental authority. The document overcame that  particular problem because the UN's Rights  of the Child document was used widely to  try to show that parental authority at some  stage has to end, that young people become  individuals and autonomous. In the end  though, more restrictions were put on the  Huang: Was there a lot of agreement  between the women in the ICPD's Women's  Caucus on how to frame the issues?  Mulay: Although the Women's Caucus  at the ICPD's structure was similar to the  preparatory meetings [held in New York,  prior to the Cairo conference], it actually  didn't function as well. One problem was  around location—the NGO Forum and the  Conference hall were about ten minutes  apart, but because of the security and the fact  that only people from accredited organizations could have access to the galleries at the  Conference room, the Conference hall was  not accessible and NGO women were not  able to lobby the government delegates directly. And while the government delegates  were free to cross over and go to the NGO  Forum without any problems, in order to be  able to enter the official Conference room  itself, you had to be on a government delegation.  This changed the way the Women's  Caucus functioned. It became simply a forum where announcements were made as to  what was happening and what issues were  coming up. Direct input was more difficult.  Also, because it was an open meeting, it  became an place where groups, like REAL  women [anti-choice North American group],  would stand up and make a lot of noise—  about how they were being excluded from  the debate, how undemocratic the whole  process was—so that some people began to  think that REAL Women represented all  women.  Huang: Were there any opportunities  for feminists from the South and the North  to get together to discuss some of the issues  or a women's action plan?  Mulay: Not really. The NGO Forum had  a lot of events and good symposia, but there  was never any discussion of what is a feminist plan of action. For example, when we  had a meeting [organized by] the Feminist  Majority Foundation of the US—a very small  group between Canada, the US, and Mexico  as part of NAFTA—to talk about common  interests and how things might move, even  in that little group, because of the time allowed and the way the issues were framed,  it was not possible to talk about a plan of  action. We basically presented the Canadian  Women's Report at that particular meeting.  [Ed note: The report was written by an ad-  hoc coalition of women in groups known as  the Canadian Women's Committee on Reproduction, Population, and Development  as an alternative and a response to the official Canadian government National Report  presented at the ICPD.]  At the Women's Caucus, the only notion that was put forward was that women  should undertake an ICPD Watch. But some  women volunteered to do a written follow-  up after ICPD in order for us to have something concrete.  Huang: Could you talk a bit about the  ICPD's discussion of the global migration  issue?  Mulay: There was a whole chapter on  migration in the document and Canada had  quite a bit to contribute to that. When I say  Canada, I mean the Canadian government,  which is considered to have moved the whole  issue of international migration and the recognition of the rights of people to better their  lives—which is different from recognizing  the right of people to flee war, for example.  There was some disagreement on the  concept of the reunification of the family,  because there was a feeling—and this was  particularly voiced vociferously by the European Union (EU)--that when you talk  about the reunification of the family, the  notion of family is different in different parts  of the world, and because of that, everybody  and his monkey's uncle could be included in  that, that it would open the floodgates to  migration. And Canada said that all countries should attempt to harmonize their national laws to enable the widest definition of  the family as it is practised in different parts  of the world.  But when I came back to Canada, I  found that a paper written for Immigration  minister Sergio Marchi had been leaked to  the media. The paper indicates the government is considering reducing the number of  migrants from 250,000 to 200,000 [see Kinesis,  October 94]. After hearing it said that [Canada's] track record is so wonderful on the  international stage, to come back and find  this is what they are doing feels like a betrayal.  This particular chapter of the [Cairo]  document also talks about the responsibilities of host countries in integrating immigrants. But in fact the leaked immigration  document talks about charging user fees for  the certain services, like language services.  I guess I found that, internationally,  Canada takes a progressive stand but that is  not always reflected in domestic policies, at  least the way I would expect it to be reflected. There has to be cohesion between the  good international stance that the government takes and the way these policies are  executed on the ground, at home because  that is the true test.  Huang: In the leaked document, the government also indicates it wants to decrease  the number of immigrants coming in through  the family class and also eliminate the Live-  In Caregiver Program (LCP), by which domestic workers presently come to Canada.  Mulay: Those are two features which  the government specifically talks about [in  the leaked paper.] It affects women primarily, both in the family class and the domestic caregiver class. How can you talk about  improving the status of women and recognizing the diversity of the family with one  breath, then talkaboutdecreasingthesenum-  bers.  In October, NAC had a meeting with  the government and I asked them point  blank, "How come there's such a discrepancy between our international stand and  our domestic policy?" They said, "Well, there  are all kinds of forces...The policy has to be  completely in tune with the needs of the  country." So there is a bit of hypocrisy there  in their progressive public international image and their national policy.  are happening in this area. There is no actual  initiation of any programs around reproductive health. So to me this Cairo plan of  action is not just about providing aid to third  world countries for family planning programs, but has to be for implementation in  Canada itself.  Huang: This conference was supposed  to focus on population and development.  You said earlier not much was discussed  around the development issues. Were there  any chapters of the Cairo plan of action that  dealt with issues of sustainable development, overconsumption in the North, or the  exploitation of migrant labour?  Mulay: Chapter Three is the only one  that deals with that. It's a very short chapter—consisting of five pages. In earlier versions of the document, this chapter was  quite comprehensive. It was gradually whit-  *eveIopmenr  On the issue of hypocrisy, I want to note  that mostly when [the North] talks about the  ICPD document, the Program of Action,  they have in mind something that is happening out there, in third world countries, countries which have high fertility rates, and so  tha t is where policies would be implemented.  But in fact, Canada itself does not have a  specific reproductive and sexual health  policy.  As federal transfer payments have decreased to the provinces, the budgets for sex  and reproductive health education have decreased provincially. That is a matter of  great concern. And when one looks at access  to reproductive health services [for women  in] rural areas, for Aboriginal women, and  so on, I think the track record is much worse.  There is one person in the federal government responsible for reproductive health.  There's no budget for her. She is one individual and all she does is monitor things that  tied down during the ICPD so there is little  substance left.  When it came to actual discussion of  what is to be done in these areas, as at other  international conferences there was tremendous resistance from Northern countries to  talk about targets for reducing  overconsumption. This was the reason for  the tension between the Southern countries  and Northern countries.  Huang: What is your sense of how  women from feminist and progressive organizations in both the South and the North  are feeling about the program of action that  came out of the ICPD? Is there a sense we can  work with this plan of action?  Mulay: I look at this particular plan of  action as a tool we have in our hands, just as  the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is a tool. How  effectively we are able to use the tool depends entirely on how things develop with  respect to the World Conference on Women  in Beijing in 1995 and the Summit on Social  Development to be held in Copenhagen in  March 1995. A number of discussions were  postponed to the Copenhagen Summit. For  example, there was a suggestion that there  be a 20 percent allocation of funds at ICPD  for sustainable development. That meant  that each donor country contributing towards the ICPD budget would allocate 20  percent of that budget for development. But  this was not accepted at the conference, it  was merely postponed to the social summit.  The Cairo plan of action provides us  withaninstrumentinthereproductivehealth  area and we should use it in our work. The  women from the South also feel they can use  it in some fashion, because there is enough  language in this document that talks about  non-coercion and not violating women's  rights. I think this monitoring of developments from the ICPD is essential.  We should be asking our government,  for example, what their specific plans are.  When we had a follow up meeting on the  "...Canada itself  does not have  a specific  reproductive  and sexual health  policy."  Cairo conference in Ottawa last month, the  government was simply talking about the  mechanics of how it was to move through  the UN process at ICPD and so on. When I  specifically asked what they were concretely  going to do with respect to Canada, they said  that they hadn't thought about it as of yet—  they are going to meet and talk about it.  But we know that, as the federal review  on health issues begins, we are going to have  to insist that women's health be defined not  just as it relates to disease but women's state  of well-being, that reproductive health be a  part of that debate, and that the review be  funded properly. There are parts of Canada  where women cannot have access to safe  abortions so this is where we need to improve the status of women. In this, the Cairo  document could be of some use to us.  Huang: Is NAC or the Canadian Women's Committee on Reproduction, Population, and Development planning any actions  to hold the Canadian government accountable to the Cairo plan of action?  Mulay: The Canadian Women's Committee will me^t in December or January,  after the Cairo document is passed by the  UN general assembly, to try to figure out in  what ways we can put pressure on the government and which areas need work. The  review of health care has come at a good  time because these questions are going to be  re-opened and we should be lobbying really  hard, asking women's groups across the  country who are active in the health fields to  give their input as to what they would want  to see [in terms of] reproductive health.

NOVEMBER 1994  NOVEMBER 1994 What's News  by Lissa Geller  Pride Day in Japan  Members of Tokyo's lesbian, gay and  bisexual communities held their first ever  Gay Pride Parade on August 28 this year.  Between 300 and 1,500 lesbians and gays  turned out to march with pride in the streets  of Tokyo.  "Japan is not an easy place to live if  you're a lesbian," said lesbian organizer,  Akiyo Ohya, "so, organizing this is a way of  reducing stress." Ohya points out that Japan's lesbian, bisexual and gay communities are largely closeted.  "This is a landmark day for us," said  one anonymous lesbian participant. "We're  able to prove that we're alive and that we  exist in this society."  New law on medical  testing in India  Social activists are celebrating a law  which has been passed by the Lok Sabha,  India's lower house of Parliament, which  aims at cracking down on medical tests that  lead to thousands of abortions of female  fetuses.  "I think it is an important step which  will be a tool in the hands of social action  groups," said Mira Shiva, a spokesperson  for the Voluntary Health Association of India. Shiva adds that women in India have  been campaigningagainst sex selection since  1982 and the new law is a victory.  The lower house voted unanimously to  regulate the use of amniocentesis—which is  meant to track pregnancy disorders but  which also indicates the sex of the fetus—  and ultrasounds, which have been used to  detect sex. The bill forces fertility and genetic counseling services to register and  monitor complaints of abuse and the use of  the two techniques. Centres will face closure  if there are complaints of abuse. As well, it is  illegal for doctors to advertise sex tests or to  disclose the sex of the fetus. The legislation is  expected to be passed in the upper house of  Parliament without incident.  While the number of female fetuses  aborted is difficult to quantify, India is currently facing a declining male to female  ratio. In 1921, there were 955 women for  every 1,000 men. In 1991, the ratio of women  to men had dropped to 927 women for every  1,000 men. Social discrimination against  women and girls is largely blamed for this  drop.  "Sex tests are a part of our social fabric  of prejudice," said Communist MP Malini  Bhatacharya.

"Dowry is to a large extent the problem in  what someone called demographic fundamentalism," said Shiva.  The bill, which took three years to pass  the lower house, is expected to challenge  this discrimination and enforce some accountability for the technology and the people using it.  Abortion in Australia  A woman's right to choose is virtually  non-existent in most Australian states and a  SupremeCourtdecisioninNewSouth Wales  (NSW) has set a precedent making that right  even more difficult to achieve.  A woman's attempt to sue her doctors  for concealing a pregnancy diagnosis from  her for five months to prevent her from  aborting the fetus has been quashed by the  NSW Supreme Court.  The court ruled in April that she could  not claim the "loss of an opportunity to  perform an illegal act."  The court's decision runs contrary to a  precedent set in 1972 which allowed for the  liberalizationof anti-abortion legislation and  provided circumstances under which abortions could be legally performed.  New women's  shelter in Victoria  A women's shelter is being constructed  in downtown Victoria in an all-woman  project aimed at providing training and  employment for street women.  The project, which will employ 12  women, will build a 15-bed emergency shelter specifically for street women in downtown Victoria. The women will receive four  months of classroom training followed by  six months on-site doing construction and  renovation work. The program is open to  women who are inadequately housed and  spend or have spent time living and/or  working on the street.  Existing services for people in the downtown core are mainly geared towards men.  "This new shelter will be planned, designed  and built by the community of women who  will use it," said Minister of Women's Equality Penny Priddy, as she announced the  $600,000 project in conjunction with the city  of Victoria and the Greater Victoria Women's Shelter Society.  The shelter, which will be a community  drop-in and sleeping environment, will  employ five women when it opens late next  year.  Lesbian bashing  in Parliament  Oh puh-leeze!! Just how long are we  going to have to put up with this nonsense??!  Liberal Nova Scotia backbencher  Roseanne Skoke has just joined the dubious  ranks of other anti-gay and lesbian bigots in  Parliament by announcing in the House of  Commons that she thinks lesbians and gays  are immoral, unnatural and "undermining  and destroying our Canadian values and  Christian morality."Frankly, we're shocked  she couldn't think of something even marginally original to say.  To top it off, Reform Party MP Myron  Thompson has made the profound realization that the Bible's mythical garden of Eden  was staffed by Adam and Eve and not Adam  and Steve! Who are these people's speech  writers anyway?  Roseanne Skoke's comments have failed  to raise an eyebrow in the Liberal caucus  and even MPs like Hedy Fry (Vancouver  Centre), who courted the gay vote in Vancouver's West End during the last federal  election, are claiming Skoke is just exercising her freedom of speech.

NOVEMBER 1994 Feature  Global restructuring in Africa:  The impact on women  by Evelyn Zinanga  The following is based on a presentation  made at the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women's annual general meeting in  ]une. Evelyn Zinanga has worked with the Zimbabwe Women's Research Centre in Harare. She  is presently based in the Hague, Netherlands.  Zinanga submitted this article to Kinesis as a  contribu Hon to Kinesis' ongoing coverage of how  economic restructuring impacts on women in  different countries, ivithin both the Northern and  the Southern hemispheres.  It is no longer debated but widely accepted that African countries are in an economic crisis. In a bid to improve their economies, African countries are going through  econom ic s tructura 1 adj ustment progra mmes,  dictated jointly by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These  policies, it is said, will open up the African  economies to the world market competition,  promote exportsand control domestic spending. Theoretically, if these policies succeed,  they will create a climate conducive to investment and consequently enhance economic  growth.  Several impacts of economic structural  adjustment have been realised by African  countries. I shall focus mainly on the impact  of these programmes on the situation of  women in Africa, and look at women's coping strategies.  Early economic restructuring  I am not an economist but a feminist  activist, so I will not go into details in economic terms, but will give a brief historical  background of the economic crisis experienced by African countries today.  In the early 1980s, many African countries experienced economic crises, indicated  by high inflation rates, stagnation, huge deficits on state budgets, and the failure to repay  the interest payments on their foreign debts.  There were many different factors which contributed to this, one being that the import  substitution industrialisation strategy of most  African countries was proving unsuccessful—prices of imports needed for economic  growth were increasing at a faster rate while  export prices were diminishing. On the other  hand, the world recession of the 1970s lowered world prices, and reduced the demand  for the primary commodities exported by  African countries.  African countries found themselves in a  tight situation because of competition in the  international market. Countries of the North  introduced measures to protect their own  industries at the expense of products from  the South. Products from the South were  priced low and this resulted in a decline in  terms of trade for developing countries in  general.  Furthermore, the oil crises of 1973 and  1979 contributed to the African countries'  economic crisis. Non-oil producing African  countries were confronted with major problems in importing enough oil to meet their  national consumption needs.  To solve most of their problems, and to  maintain a certain level of economic growth,  African countries borrowed from international institutions. In the 1980s, interest rates  on international financial loans were increased and African countries faced more  difficulties in trying to meet debt repayments.  It became increasingly impossible for these  countries to even repay the interest on their  debts. The balance-of-payment deficitbecame  the most important problem to deal with.  In view of the above developments,  stabilisation and economic structural adjustment programmes (ESAPS) became a  condition for African countries to get rescheduling of debt repayments and new  credits. The IMF and World Bank started  authorising packages of economic reforms  that were applied evenly in most developing countries in the 1980s.  The IMF and World Bank packages are  aimed at reducing the balance-of-payment  problems experienced by African countries  in the 1980s. The ESAP package includes  the following conditions:  ♦ Reduction in government expenditure;  ties, because manufacturers will have to pay  more for raw materials, and worse still for  imported raw materials. Real wages have  been falling. Higher prices for commodities,  coupled with the removal of subsidies on  staple foods have had adverse impacts on  marginalised people in Africa, especially  women, who are responsible for feeding  their families. The fall in real wages has also  forced women to sell their labour at very low  prices, for example, working as domestic  servants for the upper and middle classes.  Because of their multiple household responsibilities, women are left with little or  no options besides engaging in activities  which add to family income. Most of these  % A NATION  1 WILL NEVER  BE FREE  UNTIL  WOMEN  AKE  FKEE  • Privatisation of state-owned enterprises, including those which provide services and production alike;  • Elimination of price controls and  trade restrictions;  • Elimination of barriers to international trade such as quotas, taxes, subsidies;  • Devaluation of the local currency.  African countries started implementing ESAPs in different years and the 80s are  often cited as the period when the effects of  these programs could be noticed.  The impact on women  Traditionally, African women are responsible for the maintenance and well-  being of their families. African women have  been shouldering most of the burdens  brought about by the economic crises experienced by their countries. As if this was not  enough, they have to overcome the problems brought about by the structural adjustment programmes.  Most African countries have devalued  their local currencies, to make them cheaper  in relation to foreign currencies. This results  in an increase in prices of local commodi-  activities are in the informal sector. The informal sector has become a survival strategy  for most African women rather than an option. One would think it logical that with  more and more women engaging in informal sector activities, this would challenge  the traditional sexual division of labour in  the household, but this has not been the case.  The extra income-generating activities have  actually increased the double workload African women always experienced.  As African governments are forced by  the requirements of the structural adjustment programmes to restrain spending by  cutting employment in the civil service, retrenchment programmes have mostly  focussed on unskilled workers, the majority  of whom are women. In such a situation,  women are the ones most likely to lose their  jobs.  Most African countries have reduced  expenditures on health services and educational subsidies, and this has left families to  shoulder their own educational and health  needs. This has led to health and economic  problems in the household, with the bulk of  the problems falling on women who have to  ensure household survival. Most people in  Africa rely on government health services  and cuts to these services have caused serious problems in most African countries.  In Tanzania, where statistics are available, government reduced expenditure on  health from nine percent spending in 1973-  1974 to 4.9 percent in 1985-1996. Women and  children have been seriously affected. Maternal death increased due to poor health  services, as did malnourishment among lac-  tating women and children. The data is not  complete because not all women attend  maternal and health clinics; deliveries often  take place at home. However, maternal  deaths are estimated at 3,000-4,000 per year.  This shows how reduction of government  expenditures on essential services like health  can cause serious problems for marginal  groups in society like women.  With cuts in spending on education by  most African countries, this may lead to a  African women  have been  shouldering most  of the burdens  brought about by the  economic crises  experienced  by their countries  reduced number of women and girls entering schools because of the patrilineal and  patriarchal nature of most African societies.  School fees are likely to rise due to price  hikes and reduced subsidies. When parents  do not have enough money to send all their  children to school, they are left with little or  no choice except to prioritize. It is probable  that in many African families, boys or men  will be prioritized, because male supremacy  is still prevalent.  Conditions are becoming harder and  harder; the social, economic and political  condition of women is deteriorating daily.  Women are faced with huge responsibilities,  with no assistance from the state. Some  women, who have found themselves under  desperate conditions, have resorted to prostitution as their last resort.  The little there was in welfare provisions has been eroded by harsh economic  restructuring conditions, which do not have  a human face. Women are made to pay for  loans whose borrowing they have never been  a part of.  However, due to differences in society,  in terms of class, race, ethnicity and gender,  the impact of the structural adjustment programmes have affected people differently.  The rich are benefitting from ESAPS at the  expense of the poor. The gap between the  poor and the rich is widening by the day.  ESAPs are mainly focused on economic indicators, and pay no attention to social implications. This is why the measures end up  adverse affecting the position and situation  of women. ESAPs take away from women  whatever they have fought for economically, socially and politically. Women are  being disempowered and marginalised in  terms of their access to productive resources  and decision making.  NOVEMBER 1994 Women and Quebec  On September 12th, the Parti Quebecois won the provincial elections in Quebec, setting  in motion the PQ's drive for Quebec independance. A referendum on Quebec sovereignity  is expected to be held in Quebec next year.  This is Part One of Kinesis' feature on what women in Quebec are saying about some  of the implications for women of the new government in Quebec, priorities for women's  organizing in the period leading up to the 1995 Quebec referendum, and the ongoing work  and strategies of the women movements in Quebec. Part Two will appear in theTJecember/  January issue of Kinesis.  Interview with Michelle Roy  as told to Marie-France Dubois  TheFederation des femmes du Quebec (FFQ) was founded  in 1966 and is apolitical pressure group working in collaboration with various groups towards equity, equality, respect and better living conditions for women. The following  interview zuith the FFQ's Michelle Roy, took place infrench  in Montreal last month.  Marie-France Dubois: What has the strategy for the FFQ  been in the pre-election campaign?  Michelle Roy: The FFQ was active around the federal  election in 1993 with a coalition of women's groups in  Quebec called Coalition Femmes93. This same coalition was  shortly reinstated as Coalition Femmes 94 for the provincial  elections. This coalition included about 25 provincial women's groups, each of them including numerous other groups,  such as union groups. We attempted to get a debate on  women's issues by the leaders of the parties around the  federal elections but it failed because the leaders refused to  participate. We did not think it was realistic to put our  energies towards trying to get a leaders' debate for the  provincial elections.  We decided to try to make women's voices heard  throughout the campaign through various interventions  within the media. Coalition Femmes 94 organized a press  conference before the televised leaders' debate. We got quite  good coverage. We asked the questions relevant to us and  our message to the political leaders was that they should talk  about the real problems, those unacceptable realities of  women's lives which need urgent changes: the poverty of  women who are the heads of households and their children;  harassment of women on welfare; violence against women;  inequities and inequalities on the job; racism and discrimination of Aboriginal women and women of colour; the silence  and ostracism toward lesbians, especially those who have  children; the isolation and non-recognition of women's  work at home and the non-respect of women's experience in  children's education; the marginalisation of older women  and their poverty; ...the list of those well documented issues  is long. Some of those questions were addressed in the  televised debate, although very evasively.  It was clear that women's issues were not on the agenda  of the poltical parties, neither at the federal nor at the  provincial levels. The referendum issues of sovereignity for  Quebec eclipsed all the other issues in the provincial election  evidently. We can say that women's issues were among the  excluded ones...  Dubois: Do you think the FFQ will have better allies in  this new government?  Roy: We can say that it is more promising because some  deputies come from the women's movement. Some of them  were part of provincial groups or community groups for ten,  fifteen years. For example, Jeanne Blackburn and Louise  Harel. Those women are better informed of who we are and  what we want because they fought for women's rights too  but wecan'tbeconvinced of their unconditional support. It's  all the question of how once women enter politics, you  become tied to a party line. But we do have closer links with  some women in the government now than we did with the  Liberal government.  At one point in the campaign, the Parti Quebeqois made  promises and at the moment, there are signs that they are  working on some of them. For exa mple, there is a committee  made up of some newly elected women MLAs who are  coming directly from the women's movement, as recently as  6 months ago. I refer to women such as Celine Signori and  Lise Leduc. This committee has started to consult with some  groups for the implementation of an automatic perception  system alimonies (family maintenance programs). At the  moment the committee is looking at the Ontario model and  other models. They are attempting to decide which model  would be best for Quebec... It's clear that something is going  Interview with Madeleine Parent  as told to Ellen Woodsworth  Madeleine Parentis a feminist based in Montreal, xvho  worked in the union movement in Canada for 41 years  before retiring in 1983. She was a founding member of the  Confederation of Canadian Unionsin 1968; of the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) in 1972;  is a member of the Federa Hon des Femmes du Quebec (FFQ),  La League de Droite et Liberte, a civil rights movement in  Quebec, and is active in the abortion rights movement in  Quebec. Parent spoke with Kinesis in October.  Ellen Woodsworth: Could you tell us what stage you see  Quebec at at this time?  Madeleine Paren t: Right now, people want change. People in Quebec are discontented with what is going on  federally, as well as with the policies of the previous Liberal  government in Quebec, which really never fought for our  rights and interests.  We've been given promises by the newly elected Parti  Quebeqois and there is a watchful sense amongst the people  of Quebec and amongst the women. We will begin to see  how the new regime develops its policies and the women's  movement is preparing to be active on the issues that  concern us, as well as concern the people of Quebec.  We are also much affected by the development of the  free trade policies, the influence of the World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund on the policies that our governments have been putting into practice. There is considerable unemployment in Quebec. Many factories have closed,  never to open again which makes the situation very different from 20,30 or 50 years ago, when there was a recession,  but the economy would eventually bounce back. This is not  in the cards now.  Because of the great discontent, there is a need to  involve people much more in developing the policies that  are needed to help to restructure the economy in a way  where competition is not the only goal, but where the  interests and the social conditions of the people are the  important thing.  Woodsworth: What has the impact of free trade policies  been on women?  Parent: Many many people have been laid off and  women, of course, have been very severely affected by the  closing down of factories. The garment industry, for example, which employs at least 75 percent women, has been  deeply affected—it has gone down drastically. Women  have also lost a lot of jobs due to the cut-backs in social  s by the previous government, made under the pretext that the debt is too great and we have to cut back.  Women have lost jobs in the health service sector in  much greater numbers than ever before, and many women  can only get part-time jobs or precarious jobs under contract—since the terms of contracts are limited, a woman may  get a job for six months and then she has to run and look for  something else. This has meant a great step backwa rds in the  conditions of womenin the workplace.  We also still don't have the social services which are  required to free women to be able to get more decent jobs and  give their time to it—healthcare, social welfare and childcare  are not up to what is needed. All of these burdens fall on the  shoulders of women.  Woodsivorth: So these are some of the crucial factors that  led to people wanting a different type of government?  Parent: Absolutely. The handling of social welfare policies by the previous government was absolutely brutal. In  [former Quebec Premier] Robert Bourassa's day, the Quebec  Liberal government launched a public campaign saying that  too many people on social welfare were defrauding the  public treasury, in the interests of giving the public the  impression that there was so much abuse, the government  had to do something drastic.  Then the government developed a core of investigators  who would go into the homes of people on welfare—many  of them women—and open the refrigerators or look under  the bed for men's socks or shoes, to see if there was a man  around who wasn't declared as a supporter or a companion.  It was a terrible campaign, impacting of course upon the  women, frightening them. But it was also intended to give  the public the impression that many women on welfare are  frauds. It was an absolute violation of the right to privacy of  women who receive welfare.  This campaign against people on welfare has continued  and expresses itself in the form of obliging people on welfare  to accept work under greatly inferior monetary conditions.  If they refuse [this workfare], not only do they not get the  very small pay—less than minimum wage—for these jobs,  but their regular welfare pay is cut. So they are forced into,  for example, providing certain health services or services to  elderly people, that undercuts the pay standards and conditions of the regular workers who once did this work. In that  way, the government was destroying the validity and the  strength of the minimum wage and labour standards legislation.  Woodsworth: How did the women's movement help to  get rid of the Liberals and bring about the change in government?  Parent: By protesting, of course. We have a common  front of different popular organizations, some of which  work with the Federation des Femmes du Quebec (FFQ) or  groups such as Solidarite Populaires Quebec, which is a  coalition of women's groups, youth groups, unions and so  on.  Woodsworth: How broad-based is the women's movement in Quebec today?  Parent: There is a network of women's centres, which is  called "R" des centre des femmes which has 85 or 90 women's centres all over the province. The members are housewives as well a s women who work outside the home, mostly  women in precarious jobs or not well-paid jobs. The centres  also work with the women's committees of different unions.  There's been a considerable improvement in the women's movement in Quebec over the last four years and,  consequently, the FFQ is working in harmony with other  women's groups, with unions and beginning to reach out to  women of colour groups, which they did not before. There  is still some progress to be made, because in working with  [marginalized groups], they must understand that  [marginalized groups] must be assured that their input is  welcome.  There is also cooperation between the FFQ and NAC, as  was evidenced at the recent conference on social policy in  Regina that was co-sponsored by a group at the University  of Regina, NAC and the FFQ in a significant gesture of  cooperation.  The FFQ are currently organizing a Quebec women's"  march which should be held in late Mayor early Juneand we  hope that people from all parts of Quebec will participate.  Woodsworth: How does the women's movement work  with sectors of women such as seniors and lesbians?  Parent: There's a fairly active lesbian and gay movement  here in Quebec and the main women's organizations are  very sympathetic to it. And of course, many lesbians are part  of the women's movement.  There's an organization called AQDR or L'Association  Quebeqois de Retraite which is the Quebec Association of  Retired and Pre-retired—women over 50—which has been  very active and dynamic. They've been working with all of  the organizations, including NAC, the FFQ and Solidarite  Populaire Quebec.  Woodsworth: Many of the larger organizations tend to be  based in Montreal and Quebec City. Could you touch on the  relationship of rural women to these urban-based organizations?  Parent: As an example, there's a women farmers' union  which is called L'Associationdes Agriculcris de Quebec. The  union is very active, efficient, and works on various issues— to happen. The position of the former Liberal government  has been that they did not want to penalise, with an automatic system, those who made the child support payment!  [mostly men].  Also, following a strike last year in daycares demanding  increased wages for daycare workers', the Liberals accepted  to fund a $1 per hour increase for daycare workers wages for  6 months. The PQ just renewed this grant for another 6  months and created a working committee on this issue.  Although these are very temporary gains and even though  we can never take anything for granted, we hope that the PQ  will be consistent with them.  Dubois: How is the FFQ going to work with the issues of  the referendum and the various positions on the issue with  different populations of women in Quebec?  Roy: Last year, at the AGM, we did not know if there was  going to be a referendum. We decided to be actively involved  in the pre-election campaign and if there was going to be a  referendum, we would consult with the membership of the  FFQas to the actions to be taken. Like everyone else, we don't  know when the referendum will be held and we have not  consulted the members yet. However, we know now tha t we  need to be ready for it and that it's going to happen quite  soon.  The position as to how and on what we will be consulting the members will be discussed by the board of directors  on October 22 and 23. The action will be decided from the  position of the majority of the group members. We are going  todo a large consultation, not only by phone or in writing but  with debases and meeting in the regions.  It's clear that the referendum is going to be a crucial  moment in Quebec. How we are going to be consistent with  our desire to get closer to and collaborate with Aboriginal  women, immigrant women, and Anglophone women and  other minority women's groups in Quebec and agree on a  particular position we can defend which does not attack the  links we are building right now with all these groups. Right  now, with the actual membership of the FFQ, we know that  there won't be a majority for the NO. However, we also  know that outside the membership, there is a population of  women which might be more divided on the issue. How are  we going to consider that? At the moment, I don't know.  What I know is that we don't want the position we are going  to take to put an end to our relationships. Does that mean we  are not going to say or do anything...all of this remains to be  thought through.  Dubois: What do you think of the reaction of the PQ to  the Social Policy changes proposed by Minister of Human  Resources Lloyd Axworthy?  Roy: We were quite disappointed with the reaction of  the PQ with regards to the Axworthy reform. They reacted  by saying that the federal government is infringing on  provincial territory so that it is even more appropriate to  "...the PQ has to prove  that they can do  a better job  for the people in Quebec."  realise the independence of Quebec. We were expecting this  reaction but we would have expected a counter attack  addressing issues such as who is affected by this reform,  what is going to be lost, and the impact this reform will have  on the poorest, least privileged and most penalized people  who are directly attacked in these plans of reform. We are  directly concerned with those who are going to pay for these  changes.  In that sense, the PQ has lost a good opportunity to gain  supporters at a time when the PQ has to prove that they can  do a better job for the people in Quebec. This Axworthy  reform is a priority for the FFQ this year. We are actively  involved with other groups in Quebec and in Canada to  analyse this issue and to participate in the consultation  process in order to mobilize against unacceptable cuts in the  budgets. We do not want the government to start calculating  revenues on the basis of a family income nor do we want to  see them impose employability measures on everybody  without any protection. There are a lot of isssues which are  unacceptable to us. In Quebec we are involved in a joint  project of consultation and information with the NAC and  other women's groups.  Dubois: What other priorities has the FFQ for this year?  Roy: The third priority which is very important for us is  a project of a 10-day march for next spring to mobilise  against women's poverty. We have already been working on  this project for about five months. About 35 groups in  Quebec are involved so far. This project in particular is one  where we have been developing links and unity in practice  with groups of cultural and other minority groups. The  march will involve hundreds of women leaving in groups  from Montreal, Longueuil and Riviere-du-Loup to meet in  Quebec City. There will be events in the towns and villages  where women will stop, with a great emphasis on raising  awareness in the general public about poverty issues women  are confronted with. As well, we will raise the ten  revendications (demands) chosen by the women's groups  involved. One a day would be announced. These demands  are going to be very specific and aimed at providing concrete  improvements women need to fight poverty in the short  term. For example, we will lobby for a specific deadline to  obtain our demands and we hope that when thousands of  women mobilize around this march, the multiplying factor  of going through a large number of municipalities as well as  the media focus on this event will create a momentum for  concrete changes. This project has brought us closer to  groups we were not in contact with in the past, so that is a  positive step.  This project is very dear to us because it's women who  initiated it as opposed to the Axworthy reform or the Quebec  referendum, which are being imposed on us and we have to  deal with them even though we'd rather put our energies to  more constructive projects. However, the political context in  Quebec is good in some ways at this time because we can put  some pressure on the PQ which should at this time be more  open to listen to Quebecers.  In the long term, women meed to find a new power  balance in the current context where women in this country  are confronted with worse than the status quo; we are  actually losing some of the gains we made in the past. The  challenge for us is to be more representative of the diversity  of women in Quebec, especially minority groups. We need  to develop better understanding of the realities of minority  groups and that can only be done by working together more.  Marie-France Dubois moved from Quebec to BC 5 years ago  and works for Reseau Femmes Coiumbie-Britannique, a  francophone women's network in BC.  economic and social questions, such as child care for women  on farms, which isn't the same as urban day care. There are  other similar groups which are spread out throughout the  province that are considered to be within the women's  movement.  Woodsworth: What is the relationship between the  Quebeqois women's movement and the Aboriginal women's movement?  Parent: Women [of colour and Aboriginal women] have  tended to be the majority in NAC-Quebec for many years,  and so have taken the initiative. NAC, and particularly  NAC-Quebec, worked with Aboriginal women in the 70s  and 80s, who were fighting to change the Indian Act so that  women who lost their Indian status through marriage or  through taking a non-status Indian partner could r  their Indian status. That was one  At this point, the PQ have named some very interesting  women ministers to the provincial legislature. And of the six  cabinet ministers on the priority committees, threeare women.  Also, during the election, the PQ made a promise they  would take action on pay equity legislation. They haven't  gone into it yet, but the Minister of Labour, Louise Harel,  who is one of our best women in the Quebec legislature,  plans to follow through on that promise. And we intend to  remind her. "Look, we expect that you are going to deliver  on this." Harel is very solid in her constituency, which is a  working-class constituency in the eastend of Montreal, and  she is one of the women on the priority committees of  Cabinet.  The Quebec legislature opens on November 29, and we  will see from the speech from the throne what they intend to  of the great endeavors of joint  ^rk "...the Bloc's social consciousness as a group  While that law was changed,  its application in terms of making  it possible for these women who  wish to resettle into their communities, has met with a lot of obstruction. Aboriginal women have  had to resort to the courts to ensure their rights against  discrimination under human rights legislation and Charter.  The Quebec Native Women's Association was the outstanding provincial association working on that issue. NAC, and  NAC-Quebec in particular, supported that work.  This is not the overall situation in Quebec but at least  now there is a desire among organizations to be broader. In  some situations, that desire becomes an urgent one, especially in the case of the FFQ, where they're organizing the  women's march so they are reaching out, and consulting,  and inviting. I think a lot will be learned in the process.  Woodsworth: At this stage, is the women's movement  supporting the Aboriginal women's struggle around land  claims?  Parent: We've not been asked to do it. We discuss with  Aboriginal women's groups to find out what they want us to  support and then we do it. In other words, we do not initiate  the subjects on which we support them. They've been involved for quite a long time in a campaign on violence  against women and we have supported that. Also, we have  supported their work in their campaign on child care.  Woodsworth: Do you have any sense whether women in  the women's movemant will vote for or against Quebec's  sovereignity in the upcoming referendum in Quebec?  Parent: The Parti Quebecois has made a certain number  of promises and it's too early to say how many of these  promises they are going to deliver on. If they do deliver on  a lot of them, then their credibility in the referendum will be  much greater. If they disappoint people, they don't stand  much of a chance.  is greater than that of the Liberal Party  and certainly than that of the Reform party."  follow through on in terms of their election promises, and  we'll go after them. I say our work is well cut out if we are  to expect anything from this government or any government. We've got to be organized with a plan that's worked  out amongst the different groups and we've got to go after  it.  Woodsworth: Do you think having the Bloc Quebecois as  the official federal opposition party in the House of Commons is useful to women in Quebec in particular, and to  women in Canada in general?  Parent: The Bloc exists mainly to ensure Quebec has a  voice in the parliament, that is, the Quebec that is fighting for  change and is pro-independence. But they also take their  responsibilities as the official opposition very seriously.  When we held the NAC lobby with the main federal  political parties in Ottawa last June, we were received by a  very serious delegation of Bloc MPs, headed by Bloc leader  Lucien Bouchard. We got a good hearing and there was quite  an important exchange. It was certainly better than Preston  Manning and the Reform Party's refusal to meet with the  NAC lobby or to have any of his delegates caucus with us,  hence that demonstration against the Reform Party last June.  NAC put a question to the Bloc along the lines of: We  respect whatever decision the peopleof Quebec will make as  to independence or federalism. We will support Quebec  women in whatever decision they make. We understand  that, with respect to social legislation and other laws, the  people of Quebec will want to do it in a different way but, as  people in the rest of Canada, we are concerned that the Bloc's  focus on dealing with the situation in Quebec not threaten  our national social programs and other guarentees we have  obtained over the years. We ask the Bloc, as the official  opposition that, when you are taking a stand for Quebec on  legislation, you also consider our legitimate desire not to  break up our social programs piecemeal and leave them at  the mercy of every other provincial government.  Bouchard asked for a repeat of that question, took a little  bit of time thinking about it and then said: "Yes, I agree with  you." But Bouchard can only do something about it if he's  asked. He won't be there if all he is pressured to do is speak  for people in Quebec and is ignored by others. In my  opinion, the Bloc's social consciousness as a group is greater  than that of the Liberal Party and certainly than that of the  Reform Party.  Woodsworth: So, you're saying that the women's movement in  the rest of Canada could go to the  Bloc and ask for their support to,  say, fight the federal social policy  review?  Parent: Yes. And I think that  when a group puts out a communique protesting something, it  should make sure that the Bloc get it.  Woodsworth: Could you suggest ways the women's  movement in British Columbia can work with the Quebec  women's movement to strengthen both our social movements?  Parent: It would be good if women in BC held some kind  of a conference or discussion and invited four or five women  from the women's movement in Quebec to discuss our  common interests with respect to social programs, fair taxation, child care, education, global restructuring and human  rights. At least you would get the point of view of women in  our movement from different aspects of life here.  The other thing is that, not only for women in BC but for  feminists across the country, we need to develop a thorough  and efficient united fightback against [Human Resources  minister Lloyd] Axworthy's cuts to social programs. Women  who have precarious jobs in greater numbers than men will  be hit more often and punished more if Axworthy goes  ahead with his plans to change unemployment insurance.  If we can work together on these priorities, we will  develop a kind of solidarity and understanding which will  mean that, whichever way Quebec votes in the referendum,  the solidarity between women in BC or in the rest of Canada  and women in Quebec will be preserved.

Feature  Fourth UN World Conference on Women:  Beijing '95  — getting in  compiled by Fatima Jaffer   Women in countries across the world  have been preparing for the upcoming fourth  United Nations World Conference on  Women, to be held in Beijing, People's Republic of China from September 4-15,1995.  Previous World conferences were held  in Mexico City, Copenhagen, and Nairobi  [see "Background."] The World Conferences  have tended to be dominated by men and  their agendas—for example, at the 1975  Mexico conference, only 20 percent of the  delegates were women, and most were wives  or family members of male ministers of  state, and therefore were not allowed to vote  on the World Plan of Action developed the  conference. In addition, information gathered and produced within these World conferences is  relayed   to  many of  whom do  not seem to  understand  theaimsand  accomplishments of the  conferences.  As is the  case with  most United  Nations con-  ces,  i e n  fer  The emblem for the 1975 World Conference on  Women consisted of "a stylized dove; the  biological symbol for women; and the mathematical sign for equality.  have found the non-governmental conferences held at the same time as the world  conferences much more useful. The Mexico  conference for example was the first time  that so many women of the world got together to discuss their problems from a global perspective.  The NGO Forums are a venue for  women to learn more about the issues women  from other countries are organizing around,  share stategies, discuss or argue differences,  network and lobby collectively on an international stage to exert pressure on individual nation states for social and political  change.  These are some of the better things that  have come out of the world conferences. As  September 1995 comes up, women in both  the Southand the North arealready pointing  out that, despite promises made at the 1985  Nairobi Conference, in many cases conditions have actually worsened for women  over the last ten years. Still, it is expected  that, at Beijing, there will be greater participation of grassroots women and radical activists than ever before.  The following is a preliminary summary of information on the 1995 Beijing  conference, mostly to enable women in  Canada (and elsewhere) who are not already plugged in to larger organizations  access to information on the conference  preparations to date: what it is; how to participate in the World Conference without  leaving home; how to register for the NGO  Forum; where to get more information; why  you should care/not care; et cetera.  Background  1972: 1975 was proclaimed International Women's Year (IWY) by the United  Nations to focus attention worldwide on the  situation of women.  1975: The U N World Conference of IWY  was held in Mexico City June 19-July 2. The  conference's main theme was to promote  equality between men and women, but was  largely attended by government leaders and  representatives (men) from about 140 countries (1,500 delegates).  A Tribunal was held in Mexico City  simultaneous to the conference for non-governmental organizations, including women's groups and unions (women).  At the  Mexico conference a  World Plan of  Action was  adoptedtp  provide gov-  e r n m en t s  with guidelines for national action  over a ten-  year period.  Goals included increased literacy; civic  education for  women; increased employment opportunities;  equal eligibility to vote and seek elected  office; increased health services; recognition  of the economic value of women's work in  and outside the home; and the promotion of  women's organizations.  1975-85: In December 1975, the United  Nations declared this ten-year period from  1975 to 1985 the Decade for Women, Equality, Development and Peace.  1979: The UN General Assembly adopts  the Convention on the Elimination of All  Forms of Discrimination Against Women  (Convention on EAFDAW.)  1980: A mid-decade Second UN World  Conference on Women was held in Copenhagen July 15-30.  The Copenhagen Program of Action  accepts the subthemes of the Copenhagen  conference—education, employment and  health—as the priority areas of action for  governments. Other priority areas set were:  food, rural women, child care, migrant  women, unemployed women, single mothers, and young women.  Fifty-one countries ratify the Convention on EAFDAW—the US refuses to sign.  1985: The Third UN World Conference  was held in Nairobi, Kenya, July 16-30 The  Conference was entitled "Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the  UN Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace."  Conference subthemes were: equality,  health; education, peace; development, employment, aging, women and the Media,  refugee and migrant women, women in  emergency situations, and girls and young  women.  About 8,000 women and men attended  the conference and the corresponding NGO  Forum.  Beijing 1995: Why?  Out of the 1985 Nairobi conference came  Fonvard Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, intended as a blueprint for  action to improve the status of women  through to the year 2000. However, UN  reports note that in many countries, women  are worse off than they were 10 or 15 years  ago-  Some of the questions the Beijing Conference will be expected to answer are: What  has happened since Nairobi? What needs to  be done?  Numerous pre-conferences towards the  Beijing conference have already been held in  the various regions (Africa; Asia; Europe  and North America; Latin America and the  Caribbean;), as well as within each country,  with a view to deciding the agenda of the 4th  World Conference.  As well, the conference will be called on  to ratify a Platform of Action put forward by  the UN Commission on the Status of  Women—the key issues in this document  were apparently identified at a first review  of the implementation of the Forward Looking  Strategies at a 1990 conference. Key issues  include: health, violence, poverty, education, effects of conflict, access to economic  structures, power and decision making, national machinery, human rights, media and  the environment.  Canada participated in last month's Vienna conference, at which women from  North America and European countries were  to develop their input to the Platform for  Action. Kinesis will have a report from a  young feminist  participant  from Vancouver in our next  issue.  Who gets to  go to the  World Conference?  The 1995  Beijing World  Conference on  Women is an  official United  Nations meeting. It will be  attended by  delegates from  UN member  states—national governments—and  Symbol of the 1995 Wold Conference on  ernmentaf or       Women, developed in China.  ganizations.In  order to be admitted as [non-voting]  observors to the Conference, members of  NGOs should request applications for accreditation before January 13, 1995 from:  NGO Accreditation/Fourth World Conference on Women, 2 UN Plaza, Room 1204,  New York, NY 10017, USA, or fax (213) 963-  3463.

The nurturing of the imaginations of young women  and children had become important in relation to the development of the status of  women in particular and of the nation as a  whole, especially in the context of the struggles of the post-colonial imperialism most  countries and people in the South face.  With this in mind, four women and I  came together to star.t a task-based trust  called Zimbabwean Women in Contemporary Culture Trust (ZWICCT) in Harare,  Zimbabwe.  '.WNAfl  Task-based mean that we were primarily to bring to the forefront the works of  women and to facilitate networking between  women working within the spheres of cultural production. It also meant each trustee  had a specific task — such as editing, photography, researching, desktop design, distribution— without hierarchy.  This trust was conceived to focus solely  on the work women were doing in contemporary cultural/artistic production. The reason for this was we realised how young  women and children had very few visible  role models for alternative careers or occu  pations other than the traditional or stereotypical—as secretaries,nannies, clerks, bank  tellers, wives, childbearers etc.  The tasks that ZWICCT prioritized were:  • locate women in Zimbabwe who work in  traditional and contemporary cultural forms  —from basketweavers to radio DJs to  bottletop painters to club singers — and to  collate a database by which to link these  artists. This database can be accessed at the  Zimbabwean Women's Resource Centre and  Network in Harare (ZWRCN, Box 2192,  Harare, Zimbabwe).  •To produce user-friendly publications that  highlight the lives and realities of these artists. Since 1992, ZWICCT has produced a  Diary-Notebook that profiles individuals  and groups of women and  their work through photographs and excerpts of interviews. The first diary was  sponsored financially by Sida  (a Swedish non-governmental organization) and  WomanKind (a feminist organization in the UK), and  CODE (Canadian Organisation for Development  through Education) supplied  the paper. Because paper is  scarce in Southern Africa,  books are expensive. This has  meant that many women  were unable to purchase our  publications. ZWICCT thus  published 4,000 Diaries in  1992 and gave half of these to  women's organizations,  women artists and schools for  free. This practice still continues. The newest Diary is hot  off the press.  • To research and network with women cultural  workers in the Southern Africa region. This was done  through the 1994 Diary, which  includes women from Angola, Botswana,  Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,  South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The 1995 Diary also features women  from Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and  South Africa. This is a remarkable achievement because of the difficulties of telecommunications within the Southern African  region, as well as because of the economic  and civil destabilization caused by foreign  agendas in a few of these countries.

Where everybody thought Japan wa s the place they saw when they wa tched  Shogun on TV. Obachan laughed when she  saw it. I thought it was a good story."  Hiromi Goto's novel, Chorus ,of Mushrooms opens with a couple lying langourously  in their purple Shogun-size futon, as one asks  the other, "Will you tell me a story about your  Oba~chan?" We revisit the place of comfort  and storytelling some dozen times through  the course of this novel, and it is from here  that stories within stories intertwine through  a variety of voices and temporal spaces. The  publicity write-up for a novel by what might  be considered the second Japanese-Canadian  woman novelist (after Joy Kogawa), uses a  metaphor of a peony's unfolding petals to  describe these stories inside stories. Choral  rather than floral, would be a more accurate  descriptive, as 28-year-old Goto's first novel  is a resonant chorus of women's voices which  situate a post-World War 2 immigrant family  within two colliding cultures, Japanese and  Canadian.  Set in the small Alberta town of Nanton,  Goto's novel elaborates on the relationship  and conflicts between three generations of  Japanese Canadian women: Ooachan Naoe,  her daughterKeiko and granddaughter Muriel,  who Obachan calls Murasaki. In some ways,  this is Naoe's story which Murasaki is witness, a story Murasaki speaks to her lover,  and through this very act of telling, affirms  familial complicity with her grandmother.  It is through Naoe that Murasaki reclaims and reconfigures a buried Japanese  heritage which her mother, Keiko, has tried  so hard to efface. In negotiation with a Canadian prairie reality, the family's Japanese culture is restored as grandmother and granddaughter lie intimately together in bed drinking sake, eating dried squid and osembe rice  cakes.  While Naoe and Murasaki alternately  speak in first person, we learn of Keiko only  new and  gently used books  Feminist  Philosophy 'Ģ Poetry  Native - General  Open daily 11am-7pm  Coffee Bar  1020 Commercial Drive  Vancouver BC V5L 3W9  (604) 253-1099  Bonnie Murray  Cynthia Brooke  through their depictions. Keiko, suggests  Murasaki, thinks she'saswhi teas herneigh-  bours and she thus "became an other;"  more unforgiveable, she also has a culinary  blind spot. Naoe characterizes her as a  "Nutrasweet woman [who] doesn't take  any cream", and who "converted from rice  and daikon to weiners and beans." Keiko is  the mother who agrees with Murisaki's  elementary school teacher, much to  Murisaki's own horror, to dye her daughter's hair blonde to be a more convincing  Alice in Wonderland for an upcoming school  play. But as Murasaki will concede, "Mom  isn't the wicked figure in the Walt Disney  cast of good guys and bad guys. It was  another thing of parent/child conflict. Add  a layer of cultural displacement and the  tragedy is complete."  Most powerfully, Goto's often hilarious novel effectively breaks against enduring stereotypes of East Asian-Canadians, in  particular of women. (The patrilineage of  the family's surname, Tonkatsu, literally a  deep-fried pork cutlet, is itself irreverantly  assigned humourous and precarious origins). Being Naoe's story, Chorus of Mushrooms portrays her in an emotionally complex, sensual and rich way, full of raunchy  humour, aching sexual desire ("Eighty-five  years old and horny as a musk-drenched  cat," she describes herself) and a voracious  appetite for Japanese food which Keiko  denies her. Naoe's voice is a stream of  consciousness with sprinkles of Japanese  throughout, animated by the many stories  she tells Murasaki, by her ensuing adventures in which her fantasies are fulfilled,  and some startling moments of magic that  erupt unexpectedly (including the hilarious ending which will remain unspoken  here!).  Thereare specific elaborations between  East Asian cultures and their inter-relations  in white-dominated society: the Vietnamese mushroom farm workers, and the Chinese Shane Wu, who Murasaki describes  from her childhood: "I never talked about  him in my entire life. He never talked with  me. Instinct born of fear... ThatOriental people in single doses were well enough, but  any hint of a group and it was over."  OCTOPUS BOOKS  1146 Commercial Dr.  Vancouver, B.C.  253-0913  An alternative bookstore in the  east end for new and used  books by local and international women authors as well as a  large selection of cards and  feminist magazines.  Naoe's decision to flee the family home  unannounced (not without her daughter's  Mastercard and a bit of cash, nonetheless)  precipitates a series of unexpected events in  which Keiko is most deeply affected, and  through which Murasaki will unearth family secrets which positively destabilize her  sense of knowing and her modes of perception within the economy of her family. In  many ways, however, the narrative events  are secondary to the overall momentum of  entwining voices and stories, the complex  inter-cultural spaces which are imagined by  Goto in such attentive detail, the kooky exchanges and the sensuality that is a consistent undercurrent: a care and pleasure of the  body, an enjoyment of foods, floods of  wordsounds, a profusion of scents, such as  the mysterious fushigi odour of mushrooms  which the Tonkatsu family farms.  Chorus ofMushrooms is interspersed with  Murasaki's reminiscences which are highly  resonant of the insidiousness and pervasiveness of racism: a teenage boyfriend who  wants the mystery of "oriental sex" revealed,  much to her perplexity; inquisitive assaults  on her by fellow shoppers about unfamiliar  vegetables in the "ethnic Chinese noodle  Tofu-patties exotic vegetable section of  Safeway"; and her distaste for Valentine's  Day because of the "press-out oriental-type  girl in some sort of pseudo kimono with  wooden sandals on backwards and...eyes all  slanty slits" cards that she repeatedly receives.  This is also a story about storytelling  and there is a constant sense of slippage and  fluidity in the language and structure of  stories within stories, that is a recurring  evocation or orality. "God! Did I just make  that up or is it true? 1 don't even know  anymore. Saying it out loud can make it  so..." Murasaki exclaims in response to her  own storytelling. Eventually, the implicit  love story in the storyteller's purple bed  seeps into the stories she is telling and their  conflicts begin overlapping both contexts.  And within is the love story between  Obachan and granddaughter, as their head  chatters collide despite their separation, and  their "conversations" eventually give  Murasaki the confidence and power to speak  her own stories. "Trust me," Naoe assures  Murasaki "I'll be there. And if you falter, I  will fill in the words for you until you are  ready again...Murasaki-chan we can do almost anything."

The film is the third of a three-  part series by the same filmmaker on the communal violence in India. All films in the triliogy  record the rise offundamentalist violence in India,  using live footage from roents in the 80s and the  90s, and interviews, mostly done with people in  the streets. In the fiorstfilm In Memory of Friends,  looking at Sikh scperatist movement and Punjab  as the "breadbasket" of India. The second film, In  The Name of Cod,explores the economic reasons  for the rise in communal violence. Father, Son is  further divided into two parts—Trial by Fire and  Hero Pharmacy. In both.Anand Patioardhan,  the male producer and direct or of the film, focusses  on making connections between religion, violence  and the patriarchy, as well as on how communal  violence has impacted on women in India.  Yasmin jiwani: The filmmaker's argument  seems to be that when in ancient days India  was ruled by goddess worship, woman culture did not engage in violence, and that, since  the advent of partriarchy or male worship,  men in the name of religion and-although he  neverclearly mentions this-of nationalism are  initiating the violence.  The argument then goes, the violence is  related to the impotence men are feeling which  begs the question, "Why do they feel impotent?" You have to look around at the social  conditions to find out what is it that makes the  man feel that way.  He seems to locate it back into the conquest of India by the Muslims-even though  this is not overtly stated, this is what I got as a  viewer.  Feroza Ahmed: I agree. At first, I was struck  by the film's attempt to focus on the positioning of women in Indian society and around  this communal violence. But it focuses on male  impotence as the impetus for this violence--  and only Hindu male impotence, not Muslim  male impotence.  In one part, the narrator talks about colonization and how the British colonizers tended  to place Hindu men as effeminate and weak.  He traces the current violent feelings of Hindu  men as being based in their fears of being  impotent, effeminate, or like a woman. The  violence is their way of getting their "manhood" back. He doesn't explain why Muslim  men don't feel impotent as well, since they too  fought the British side by side with Hindu  men.  Jiwani: That's because his idea depends  on seeing Muslim men as warriors, based on  the fact that Muslims were the colonizers of  India at one point in time.  Ahmed: That is the same argument that  Hindu fundamentalists use to justify the violence against Muslims—that the Muslims are  invaders and colonizers.  Jiwani: That's right. This kind of perspective is too superficial. It doesn't really take into  account all of the factors that go into creating  a sense of nationalism.  Ahmed: One of the things that stands out  in the film is the look at mainstream media  literacy—cinema and television-as tools for  inciting the communal violence. Men talk about  how they maturbate when they watch rape  scenes in the movies, how masturbation at the  movies reduces their sperm count, makes them  sexually impotent. In another scene, we see the  statue of the Indian actress Mandakini, half-  naked, being used at a Hindu fundamentalist  gathering. A man explains they are using the  statue as a symbol of how Muslim men see  Hindu women basically as objects of rape.  //M>flw:Thefilmdoeslookatdifferentforms  of comunication, such as street communication—we see men talk about whether they are  sexually potent,and you see street "hero" pharmacy at work, with men selling medicines to  increase potency in men and so on. Those parts  were fascinating and completely new for me.  Ahmed: It was pretty unique. I was stunned  when one of the men being interviewed said,  "When I see a rape happening, if I know the  woman I'll save her; if I don't, I want to join in."  I guess being a male filmmaker, he had more  access to that kind of information, horrific as it  is.  jiwani: But again, the problem is that the  narrator does not bring the connections out.  Things are left hanging and you feel like saying,  "Alright, all of this isgoing on, there is a revival,  Jiwani: The second thing about Western  colonization was it leads to a breakdown of the  traditional morals, values and customs of the  colonized peoples. You see that clearly when  you look at the relationship between the First  Nations and Western colonial powers in  Canada. But that again did not happen with  Muslim colonization of India.  Ahmed: Coming back to the film, you are  saying the film plays into this dominant, or  fundamentalist view of Muslim colonization.  I think what makes it worse is the film  doesn't do anything to flush out an understanding of Muslims in this communal situation. Briefly, we get Muslim as victim or Muslim as fundamentalist—there is no progressive  Muslim voice to shed light on anything we  don't already know. The director is a progressive Hindu, so we do get the progressive Hindu  point of view. When we get footage of anti-  fundamentalism demonstrations or women's  demonstrations, he does not distinguish between Hindu and Muslim women—one gets  Ahmed: The problem with the film is that we  don't ultimately get what his message is.  Jiwani: Well, one message that stands out is that  patriarchy is stupid.  the revival seems to be traced through the  popular dissemination of Hindu mythology,  men are feeling impotent, so what?"  One link he suggests is that the Hindus  were viewed as effeminate in colonial times  and now want to prove their manhood. Yet, if  you look at studies on the relationship between  the colonized and the colonizers, you notice  that the attribution of the feminine persona to  the colonized was common throughout.  Ahmed: And in the film, we see that language now being used by the Hindus against  the Muslims. The narrator points out that in  speeches by the Hindu revivalist parties, the  language is full of references to the seed of man,  things like, "H indu men should start acting like  real men." Meanwhile, the politician refers to  Muslims and anyone who opposes fundamentalism as "They should wear a sari."  The biggest problem I had was that, other  than a couple of interviews with Muslims mostly  as victims of the violence, the only real scenes  with Muslims were of a Muslim fundamentalist stalking onto a podium, and of Muslims  celebrating Mo'arram, the sacrifice or martyrdom of Hasan where the men flagellate themselves, which is only observedby one small sect  of Shia Muslims.  Jiwani: It is also a Shiite sect which I would  argue has in its mythology characters similar to  those in Hindu mythology. Where is the line  being drawn here? And by whom? This is  where I would ask the director, "Okay, if you're  making these linkages, why suddenly is there  an "othering" of the Muslims and what are the  factors involved in this othering?"  We must remember, we are not talking  aboutaclear,historicallybased "us" and "them"  situation. If you look at the Muslim conquest of  India, there was in fact a lot of integration and  assimilation on the part of the Muslim.  Ahmed: But the film doesn't begin to make  the distinction between Muslim colonization  and Western colonization.  jiwani: The hallmark of Western colonialism has been the total breakdown of the indigenous economy...  A hmed:... whereas Muslim colonization has  always been an integrating force, where Muslim invasions tended to add to the indigeous  economies, also for example in Africa, where it  took the form of an exchange between equals.  the impression that these are Hindi  they are not dressed in Muslim dress and are  obviously Hindu-led. Again, there is no progressive Muslim.  This would not be a problem had he then  not showed only the fundamentalist Muslims  without showing the progressive aspects. It  unforgivably plays into the kind of unchallenged Muslim bashing we see everywhere,  especially in the West  Jiwani: At one point, the director does talk  toa Muslim Imam [leader] of oneof the mosques  who says some interesting things...  Ahmed: ...but within minutes, the filmmaker turns around and discredits the speaker  when he brings up the question of the low  status of Muslim women. So, on the one hand,  he lets the Imam speak, and on the other,  devalues what he had to say by introducing a  non-progressive, in fact, reactionary element.  Once again, the Muslim he just talked to becomes yet another fundamentalist, definitely  insofar as women are concerned.  Jiwani: He does try overall to fit together  two sides of the story, yet his only notion of  balance in the film is to show a theatrical group  performing plays thatpromote integration and  communal harmony, yet ignores the question:  are those two sides as clearly demarcated as  they are presented? Or is it this particular condition that is causing them to be clearly demarcated.  For example, he talks about a street where  most of the stores were Muslim-owned. What  is the demarcating feature there and how is it  being used as a targetting of that particular  minority? One of the men mentions he knows  the Muslim storesby the names. So it is through  names that you can tell who is a Muslim.  A hmed: The man on the street also says, we  know who is Muslim because we've all lived in  this neighbourhood for a long time.  Jiivani: How has that kind of difference  between Hindu and Muslim been kept alive in  the first place? Of course the filmmaker has the  prerogative to focus his vision where he wants  but, in this case, it is a question of how much of  one fundamentalism isbeing used as a counterfoil for the other fundamentalism. Clearly in  the film, Muslim fundamentalism doesn't really effectively counterfoil Hindu fundamentalism because you're left with the questions,  "Which came first?" and "Did the Muslim fundamentalist really spring up as a reaction to the  Hindu fundamentalist?"  Ahmed: The problem with the film is that  we don't ultimately get what his message is. It  isalso dangerously irresponsible with the Muslim side of .things-raising issues, then not dealing with them. But the film is important in that  it shows how communalism has attacked  women first and foremost.  jiwani: Well, one message that stands out  is that patriarchy is stupid.  Ahmed: Though he uses amusing Western  Feminism 101 language to get thatpoint across.  I can't help thinking the director's discovery  that patriarchy plays a key part in communal  violence is probably amusing for the women  who have been saying this all along.  jiivani: When I saw the film, I was first  struck by parts that reminded me of the National Film Board's Goddess trilogy: Goddess  Remembered, The Burning Times, and Full Circle. The filmmaker mentioned he was aware of  this work. Parts of Father, Son... so closely resemble The Burning Times, it seemed like the  film had imported Western stuff to explain the  situation in India.  But in fact it is actually quite a contrary  history to that in Burning Times because, yes,  you did have goddess worship and yes, the  religion has shifted to a male emphasis around  the phallus, but the critical question is, "What  are the factors that promoted this shift?"  When you look at some writing by Indian  feminists, you find out that the notion of sati,  for instance, was a practice that actually came  in after the British colonized India. The British,  by pushing the Brahmin-caste to the top in  terms of economic cultural power, meant that  this practice, just like the practice of foot-binding in China, was elevated to a court practice  which then spread, making its way to the other  classes in their attempt to raise themselves up  the class system.  Historically, when that practice was elevated, the British used it as a platform to enter  India, saying, "Well, look at these people.  They're barbaric. Look at the way they treat  their women."  Again, the whole rescue image comes in.  There's a lot of that kind of contrary stuff about  Islam too. So to pinpoint one culture as this film  does, saying, "Well, it's sexual impotency causing the fundamentalism," and another culture  saying, "Well, there's a natural warrior element  there," is essentializing.  Ahmed: Actually, the film begins with his  attempt to contextualise the point he is making  about the shift to patriarchy and subjugation of  women. It has footage of the witch burning  genocide of women in Europe, and it tries to  make parallels with other religious cultures,  pointing out how religion has always been  used to persecute women, how what's happening in India is not peculiar to India, the rise of  fundamentalism is everywhere.  Jiwani: But why use historical material to  make that point which makes it easy for the  West to say, "You see, the whole notion of  progress is really true; we already bypassed  that whole period and you guys are still involved in it." If he had wanted to make that link,  why not go into Bosnia or get footage from  there? Ultimatelv, it feeds into the notion that  India is still embroiled in its struggles toward  progress and equality.  Ahmed: I remember the first thing you  said when I asked you what the movie was  about was, "Oh yeah, it's basically about how  fundamentalisminlndiahasarisenbecausethe  Hindu male is feeling impotent." I hadn't seen  the movie yet but I thought, "Oh no, is that like  saying violence against women happens because men are feeling impotent?"  Jiwani: Yeah. But I have to say, it certainly  wasn't a boring film.  18  NOVEMBER 1994 Arts  VIFFreview: Of Women by Women:  A token sampling  by Laiwan   OF WOMEN BY WOMEN: NEW WOMEN'S FILMS FROM JAPAN  International premieres at the  Vancouver International Film Festival,  October  Three short films were shown under the  title "Of Women By Women, New Women's  Films From Japan" at the recent Vancouver  International Film Festival. I attended because I  was curious to discover the promises such a title  offered. '  Yes, each film is made by a woman, each  subject is a woman, the works were experimental, I guess they are new since each was made  within the last two years, and they are longish  shorts (from 15 to 36 minutes in length). So far  so good.  But then again, I get stuck on the "New  Women's Films" part. Does that make it a film  by a new woman or is it a new filmby a woman?  Now, you may think I'm being a smart-aleck  and rhetorical because we all do assume it's the  latter. But the films seen in the context of this  categorization made me question how we are  set up to enter the films with an expectation of  some kind of universal representation of  "women", and to come away with comprehension of a situation.  Before I can elaborate, perhaps I should  describe the films.  Water In the Ear/Mimi No Naka No Mizu by  Keiko Utagawa explores the anxieties a young  woman has — thather breasts are too small, and  that someone is in her ear whenever she submerges her head in her bath water. She consults  experts to no avail. Set in an urban city, most of  the scenes are shot indoors.  Although this description of the film alludes to some sort of linear narrative, the film is  neither linear nor with narrative. Repetitive  imagery of the young woman deliberately falling backwards into her stainless steel bath (more  like a large sink), remaining motionless submerged in the water, and repeating this back  and forth between two baths that are next to  each other confounded me about what was  being expressed. Are these complex personal  rituals, compulsive pathological experiences,  experiments in surrealism or all of the above?  The write-upof thefilmnotes"her desire to  solve these problems eventually leads her from  the private space of her bathroom to the public  space of a communal bath in a health centre."  This description makes the film appear to have  a linear, even a socio-political narrative. The  scenes in the public bath felt removed from the  women whose bodies the camera captured. To a  degree, the scenes felt surreptitious; 1 thought  the camera may have been hidden. The voiceover,  noting the "long drooping breasts" of the older  women, emphasized the voyeuristic positioning of the filmmaker and, inevitably, the viewer.  This illustrates to me again how the assumptions in the programmer's write-up project  and impose another narrative onto a work.  Formally,  the film uses  walking  handheld camera  and stationary  camera techniques, diary-  type visual and  audio vignettes  (that were simultaneously translated; however,  much could not  be heard because  the film's sound-  track was louder Silhouetted Light  than the translator's mike), and a lot of water  sounds. As an experimental film not much was  challenging to the medium of film, surrealism,  or the developing of its metaphors beyond expressing its internalized subjectivities. However,  it did win the Special Jury Prize of the Image  Forum Festival in Tokyo this year — I explore  the meaning of this later.  Silhouetted Light/Kage No Akari by Yukie  Saito is described as a "psychodrama of shattering vehemence and intensity — about a young  woman who has no place of her own when the  wind dies down and shadows disappear". Beginning with a young woman crouching in her  kitchen with a soundtrack of a woman having  sex—it hints at the formation of a conventional  narrative. This later proves to be untrue. The  young woman goes out into the street, again the  setting is in an urban city. She sees a young  man—who seems stoned, attempting to light a  bag of garbage on fire and then throw it unlit  over the next building—and she follows him  through the streets. This cuts to intense images  set in her kitchen that can be read as the unfolding of her complex internal life expressed through  surreal symbols. The key scene is her act of  separating her black goldfish, who live in an  aquarium, by putting them into tiny little  glass jars where they can hardly survive,  then killing themall, collecting their eyes and  later letting these float out of her hand in a  sewer-like stream at the outskirts of the city.  Then follows disturbing images of anguish  that show this young woman ripping off her  clothing. She is left sitting naked on her  kitchen floor—lost, abject and abandoned.  This film filled me with despair at its  depiction of such intense isolation. I cannot  (won't) say any more about it.  The last  film Cordyceps  Sobolifera/  Tochu Kaso by  F u m i e  Kamioka is  Bj more visually  B experimental  ■ than the others.  Using digital effects to layer  images of trees,  indoor spaces,  floating petals  and water,  Kamioka adds  more layers with sparse, haunting soundtracks, especially one of wooden clogs walking on gravel with a full moon on screen. The  title refers to a parasitic fungus that enters  fruiting plants through their roots. There is a  glimpse of a portrait of an elderly woman,  but there is no evidence of who or what she  is in connection to. The write-up for the film  describes it as "a haunting reverie only just  this side of delirium...It's up to you (if you  feel so inclined) to disentangle the metaphors from the dreams; many viewers willbe  happy simply to surrender to Kamioka's  construction of a state of mind in which past,  present and future intertwine."  I found this film to be long and tedious.  The film is a personal delirium in itself that  needed editing. I had no choice except to  move along with it— in hopes that it would  move me, in passions or in dreaming states.  In the festival program write-up, we read  that this film is in part about visiting her  grandparents in the country though I had no  clue of this from the film. The film also won  the Special Jury Prize of the Image Forum  Festival in Tokyo.  My wish is not to unravel the films themselves, but to unravel their constructed framework by the Vancouver International Film Festival. It is not that these films are without merit,  nor do I question the realities of their expressions and experiments. I just don't think they  can be called "Of Women By Women"—us—  the great mass of women, yet represented in  these films mostly in anguished, pathological,  isolated realities. "New Women's Films"—is  that like post-feminism?  In the curatorial notes we learn that the  programmer, a white man, was a member of the  jury of this year's Image Forum Festival in  Tokyo. I asked what this Image Forum Festival  was and was told by a film festival receptionist  that it is a company that distributes short films  in Japan. This made me wonder what it means  to win the Special Jury Prize from the company  that distributes the films; whether these young  filmmakersare thechosen few to be distributed  internationally; and what are the limits of the  agenda of a white man in Asia who is a jury  member in the company that distributes these  films? Can we really get unbiased, qualitative  programming within such a set up?  These three films felt like student films to  me. This program made me realize how  tokenized we are that our works may still be  developing, and, yet they are snatched up and  categorized to be representative, without the  benefit of the contexts of what they are representing being shared with the audience.  How many women filmmakers—lesbian  filmmakers included—don't get shown at international film festivals because they don'tget  picked up by a distribution company as did  these films? Having seen experimental and radical videos shown at alternative art/video venues, Ialso know thatnotalljapanese women are  limited to these internal subjective states as  represented by this program.  While watching these shorts, I remembered that 1995 is the 50th year after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that the  anti-war organi zing by Japanese women is to be  remembered and honoured.  The women's movement exists in Japan  and their struggles are as tough as ours. Contrary to the conclusions that this program of  shorts conveyed—we are notalone. Tokenized,  yes; Alone, no.

VIFF film:  Bandit Queen  BANDIT QUEEN  Directed by Shekhar Kapoor, India  Vancouver International Film Festival,  October  The Bandit Queen has been the subject of  much discussion at a number of international film  festivals. The subject ofthefilmis a woman, Phoolan  Devi, ivho was recently released from prison after  saving an 11-year term for banditry and the murders of 30 men she says she did not commit. The film,  which bills itself as a "truelife story,"claims Phoolan  Devi was sold as a man's bride at the age of 11,  repeatedly raped and abused by male villagers and,  later, bandits, became a bandit's lover, terrorized  men of upper castes and led the massacre of 30 men.  In an open letter to the director of the Toronto  FilmFestival in September, Phoolan Devireauested  that he withdraw the film from the festival. The film  ivas not withdrawn. In October, Bandit Queen  played at the Vancouver InternationalFilmFestival.  Many in the audience had heard of the letter, but  there were various versions of its content. The description of the film in the Festival program only  mentioned that the film is "controversial" and that  it has been "ban ned " in India. In fact, the film had not  been "banned," but its release in India would be  subject to the director agreeing to cuts proposed by  the Indian censor board because of the film's graphic  violent and sexual dramatizations.  Kinesis has decided not to review the film and,  to explain why, we are reprinting Phoolan Devi's  letter:  Dear Director Sahib,  My name is Phoolan Devi. I cannot read or  write. So I am asking a friend to write this to you.  Ihavebeen told that atyour festival, you are  showing a film called Bandit Queen that is supposed to be the story of my life.  I have never met the people who made  the film, and Ihavenotbeen shown this film.  I have asked them to show it to me, they have  refused. They have given everybody the impression that I am being contradictory and  that I did not want to see it. This is totally  untrue.  I have been told that the main theme of  this film is about how I was raped. And how  many times. I have never once spoken about  my rape. To anyone.  I would like to ask you, sir, you and  your audience, what you would feel if you  knew that the most private and humiliating  moments of your life were being screened  for other people's entertainment. Without  your permission, without you having been  shown the film  If this film had been about the rape and  humiliation of your daughter, of your wife,  your mother or your sister, however well-  made the film was, would you have shown  it at your festival? Would you sell tickets for  the show? I think you must be a man, just as  the makers of this film are men. I cannot  imagine that a woman would do this to  another woman. Anything else, but not this.  My humiliation and my shame is not for  sale. Not for any price.  While you watch this film about me, while  you enjoy my misery, I want you to know that  I will fight for as long as I have breath in my  body. Tomorrow, an Indian Judge at the Delhi  High Court will hear my plea. [Ed Note: Her  lawyers won an injunction preventing the film  from being screened in India, cuts or no cuts, until  her case against thefimmakers has been heard.]  As soon as I can find the money to hire a  lawyer abroad, I will sue you and your festival  and everyone else that is party to this shameful  exploitation.  I request the public of Toronto not to  participate in my humiliation. / would not go  and watch you being raped, if I knew you didn't  want me to. Please don't go and watch this film.  At least not until I have seen it.  Please try and understand that whatever I  may have done, I am a human being. Not an  animal. I have feelings. I have a family. I have  spent eleven years in prison.  I am 32 years old, and have a life ahead of  me.  Phoolan Devi  New Delhi, India Letters  Kinesis loves receiving mail. Please  get your letter to us by the 18th of  the "month.  If you can, keep the length to about  500 words. (If you go way over, we  might edit for space.)  Hope to hear from you very soon.  Love,  Kinesis  Thanks Gloria,  I'm a subscriber  Kinesis:  I am em harassed to say that 1 needed  Gloria Steinem at the University of British  Columbia to remind me that I have a women's newspaper in my home town tha 11 was  not supporting. I regret not having done this  sooner.  Looking forward to receiving my first  issue...and sending gift subscriptions for  Christmas!  Sincerely,  Sue Watson  Vancouver, BC  Julie Linkletter,  identify yourself!  Kinesis:  I'd like to comment on the letters from  Sunera Thobani and Julie Linkletter on the  99 Federal Steps in your last issue. The first  thought I had was why didn't Vancouver  Rape Relief and Transition House itself write  to Kinesis to defend its own document and  process? Is there something that happened  that you aren't telling your readers? What  makes me wonder is also the fact that Julie  Linkletter wrote under the auspices of  DAWN Vancouver and not Rape Relief, and  yet, someone mentioned to me that she also  works for Rape Relief. I didn't know that  when I first read the letter and I'm sure  many other of your readers didn't either. It's  unfair to readers who only know that Julie is  speaking for women with disabilities in her  defence of 99 Federal Steps and don't know  that she could also be writing in defence of a  document written by members of her organization. You would read the letter quite  differently if you knew that.  I'm not actively involved in the controversy around 99 Steps except through my  friends who work in transition houses here  in Vancouver,butI have been reading Kinesis.  I would like to know more about the issues  that women have with 99 Steps. I expect we  shall read about it if NAC is going to work on  buildinga policy on violenceaga inst women,  which I believe is important and I support  NAC for doing so. Fortunately NAC, unlike  Julie Linkletter, believe rural women, for  example, should be involved in the process,  I base this on the fact that Julie writes "I  doubt that they [rural women] would be as  articulate in their recommendations to the  federal government as the author of 99 Federal Steps."  I do not intend my letter to attack Rape  Relief. In fact, I support the work of that  organization. I merely think it is important  to inform the reader as much as possible  about what you publish.  Thank yor. for all your hard work. I  enjoy reading the magazine.  Sincerely,  Juliette Reynolds  Vancouver, BC  An Editorial Board note:  It is Kinesis policy to notify writers of  letters concerning their articles or letters and to  allow them to reply in the same issue in which the  letter appears.  Julie Linkletter  responds  I am writing in response to a letter sent  to you regarding my letter in Kinesis last  month. It was not my intent to discount the  experiences and knowledge of rural women  or anyone else. I realize that is the message I  conveyed though and I am regretful.  I wrote in support of 99 Steps because I  am convinced that it contains recommendations that if carried out would improve the  status and lives of disabled women in  Canada. I wrote knowing that my group  was in support of 99 Steps. If DAWN Vancouver had not been, 1 would not have writ- -  ten the letter. My response, then was from  DAWN Vancouver, not Vancouver Rape  Relief.  I was sent to the NAC AGM by DAWN  Vancouverand was their representative there.  After the NAC regional meeting, I reported  to DAWN Vancouver the discussions and  debates that took place as well as the decisions made. At that time we began to discuss  99 Steps. Before the NAC AGM, I asked  members of DAWN Vancouver for their  judgements about resolutions on which I  would be voting, including the resolution to  adopt 99 Steps as policy. I also contacted a  member of DAWN Canada to check out  where the national group stood on some of  the issues. When I returned from the AGM,  1 again reported to DAWN Vancouver.  I did not misrepresent myself when I  wrote to Kinesis on behalf of DAWN Vancouver. I am a disabled woman. I organize  with other disabled women a group for the  support of and political activism of women  with disabilities. I am also a member of  Vancouver Rape Relief. My involvement with  DAWN Vancouver as well as Rape Relief  means I a m learning so much about violence  against all women, as well as about the lives  of disabled women in general. What I learn  in each group I can pass on to the other. This  integration is useful and necessary for me  and other women as the lives of disabled  women are very much interrelated to those  of all women. Women with disabilities, in  addition to suffering from conditions directly related to their disability, also experience racism, classism and sexism. It is because of this interrela tedness tha 11 a m in two  different women's groups.  I hope this makes my intentions clearer  and helps to address some of the concerns of  Reynolds and other i  Julie Linkletter  DAWN Vancouver  Survivors excluded  from conference  Kinesis:  Radical Survivors is a newly formed  group of lesbian survivors of girlhood physical and sexual violence. We have serious  concerns about a "Dissociation, Mind Control and Ritual Abuse" Conference that was  held at a posh Vancouver hotel September  24 and 25. Registration fees were $225 to  $290 and hotel rooms were offered at the  reduced rate of $115/night. Although we  sent two letters to the organizers (Aug 8 &  Sep 20) asking about the planning, purpose  and costs of the conference, they have yet to  respond to our questions in writing.  We want to know, for instance, if there  were many feministson the organizing com  mittee. We assume there were, given that  Cowichan WAV AW and Battered Women's  Support Services were on the Abstract Review Committee listed on the promotional  brochure.  We also wanted to know if there were  any survivors of ritualized abuse involved  in the planning of the conference or giving  presentations at the event. Whether or not  there were a few survivors involved, it's  clear this was not a conference for survivors  because survivors were not invited to the  conference. Only so-called professional helpers (counsellors, psychotherapists, psychiatrists and front line workers, medical practitioners, social workers and nurses) were  listed under "Who Should Attend".  Yes, this is 1994. It is still possible for  feminists to organize a conference that deals  with a particular group of people and not  invite them. It's the brand of "feminism"  that says "you poor victims need our professional help and we're going to give it to you  in 50-minute sessions." It's the sort of "feminism" that takes over many battered women's shelters and sexual assault centres.  It wasn't so long ago that survivors  were the experts on male violence. We were  the ones who knew what was going on in  families, fraternities and cults. Now feminist therapists and counsellors are the experts. They get all their information from us,  then they write papers and then they organize conferences to demonstrate their expertise, advance their careers and get invited to  the next fancy ritual abuse conference.  As survivors, we are sick of being studied and psychologized by professionals. The  mental health industry has always looked at  women to fill their off ices, hospitals and outpatient programs. It used to be male psychiatrists and psychologists who found us  interesting and good subject matter for academic research. Nowwehavefeministthera-  pists and counsellors jumping onto theband-  wagon to get a piece of the pie. Our pie, that  In the process, the feminist community  gets divided up into the helpers and the  helpees; sexual, ritual and cult-related abuse  becomes depoliticized; and survivors lose  ownership of what rightfully belongs to us:  naming our experience. I have no doubt  there are therapists and counsellors with  good intentions, but good intentions are a  poor substitute for accountability.  The fact that survivors were not invited  to this conference or visibly involved in the  planning and presentation sends out a message-that the mental health industry would  like everyone to believe: ritual and cult-  abused survivors are too damaged to take  care of ourselves, let alone contribute anything worthwhile to academic discussions  of our abuse. That "feminist" therapists are  behind the patronizing message is appalling. That they are willing to meet psychiatrists as peers but survivors only as clients  shows how far we have to go before the  simple ABC's of feminism are really understood in our movement.

Souvienne suggests that survivors were  not involved and were not visibly present at  the conference. Survivors did take part, both  as organizers, participants and as presenters. However, Souvienne is right when she  says that survivors were not visible. One of  the key factors in healing of abuse of all  kinds is safety. The safety issues for survivors of ritual abuse are different than for  survivors of childhood sexual abuse. While  I can't speak for the organizers, I assume  they anticipated that active cult members  would be attending this conference and did  not want to present them with opportunities  to harass or contact survivors. To the best of  my knowledge, no survivor was prevented  from identifying herself as such at the conference. However, all the survivors I know  are extremely cautious about [to whom] and  where they disclose in order to create safety  for themselves. Asa member of the Abstract  Review Committee, 1 received three hangup phone calls starting at 1:30 am and ending at 5am the morning after the conference.  While I don't know for sure that this was cult  harassment, I believe it was. While this kind  of harassment may not be life threatening  (unless some self-destructive programming  is activated), itisannoyingand could be very  threatening to a survivor.  I don't agree with Souvienne that the  message was th it survivors cannot take care  of themselves. 1 think the message was that  survivors do know how to take care of their  own safety needs and were doing so at the  conference.  I also agree with Souvienne that there  needs to be ways for survivors to meet, share  experiences and support one another in the  healing process. However, this has to be  done in a way that creates safety for survivors and respects the right to privacy. I  would like to remind Souvienne that being a  cult survivor still has a stigma attached to it.  For cult survivors who are also in the helping field, this disclosure could jeopardize  their livelihood. If Souvienne has any ideas  on how survivors can meet and support one  another while staying safe and maintaining  privacy, I would like to see the ideas in this  newspaper.
