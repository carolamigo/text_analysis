Telephone: (604) 255-5499  Afrekete  FEBRUARY 1996 \8    °  As Kinesis was going to press, the BC Supreme Court was busy handing down  rulings in cases involving women's access to abortion services and what lesbians and  gays can read.  The day before we went to press, Judge E.J. Crorrin struck down significant portions  of the Access to Abortion Services Act—also known as the "bubble zone" law. Cronin  said the legislation went too far, and acquitted the first anti-choice protester ever  charged with violating the law.  The Act was brought in last year with support of pro-choice activists [see Kinesis  July/August 1995], and was supposed to stop the harassment of abortion service  providers and women who use those services by setting up a bubble zone around  abortion clinics and service providers' homes.  But now it's open season again...the Court ruled that anti-choicers have the constitutionally protected right to continue their business—that of intimidating women in  order to stop them from choosing to have abortions.  The judge said the bubble zone law violated the anti-choice protester's freedom of  expression because it "eliminated all peaceful protests and any form of communication  or attempted communication" within the bubble zone.  Since when are intimidation and harassment peaceful communication?!  Obviously, the judge was more concerned with the rights of anti-choicers to do their  protesting, than with the rights of abortion services providers to not be harassed,  followed or stalked, or with the rights of women who want to use abortion clinic services  to access a legal medial service. (Could you imagine if there were protests outside  hospitals to stop heart surgeries?!)  More on the topic of protesting...an Ontario Divisional Court just ruled that a  boycott campaign by the Toronto-based group. Friends of the Lubicon, violated Daishowa  Inc.'s right and ability to do their business in Canada—logging.  There seems to be a trend here (all in the favour of big business and  multinationals)...Last year, BC forestry corporation MacMillan Bloedel successfully  obtained an injunction against "John and Jane Doe and persons unknown..."—essentially the general public—to prevent them from interfering with MacBlo's business—  also, logging—in the Clayoquot Sound area on Vancouver Island. That private injunction resulted in hundreds of criminal prosecutions and jail terms for peaceful protestors.  So the moral of these stories (and there is one) is...If you're interfering with the profit  margin—the making of money, lots of money—of large multinational corporate entities  operating in Canada, then you can forget about protesting and picketing. But, if you're  just interfering with a woman's right to choose to have an abortion or with people who  provide abortion services, then go ahead and protest.  We will be bringing you more of an analysis of the bubble zone decision and  women's reactions to it in our next issue.  Meanwhile, back at the provincial courthouse, the BC Supreme Court also came  down with its ruling.. .finally! (it only took them 13 months). ..in the Little Sisters case [see  story page 3]. Janine Fuller of Little Sisters says she considers the decision to be a 75  percent victory for the lesbian and gay bookstore.  Judge Kenneth Smith ruled that Canada Customs was homophobic, and that it was  discriminately targeting Little Sisters and other lesbian and gay bookstores when it  searched and seized their shipments of books and magazines. But Smith wouldn't take  it a step further and strike down Canada Customs' right to be the "judge" of what  materials we are allowed to read in Canada.  In our March issue, we'll be running a more extensive report on the case and the  implications of the decision for Little Sisters.  Hey, it's that time of the year again. It's February, and you know what that means...  It's budget time again. How exciting. Now we get to see whatnew cuts the federal Liberal  government will be making to our social programs (on top of all the ones they've been  making over the past year).  We hope to be able to provide an analysis of this year's budget, but who  knows...governments have a history of announcing their budget on the day Kinesis goes  to press. If we do get to report on the budget, we'll also bring you an excerpts from the  "alternative budget" to the budget, prepared by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.  Oh, don't forget that the Canada Health and Social Transfer—which will slash  transfer payments to provinces and eliminate national standards—will soon be in effect:  April 1st. And remember the guy who introduced us to the CHST: Lloyd Axworthy.  Well, it looks like he won't be the one to bring it in for us. The word is...the ax-man is  going to be moved out of his Human Resources Development portfolio and into foreign  affairs, as part of Jean Chretian's cabinet shuffle.  Back to the subject of multinational corporations and their profits...did you know  that January 25th is Corporate Tax Freedom Day. That's the day marking the point in the  year when corporate Canada frees itself from any responsibility to pay income taxes  (that's it, for the rest of the year). Of course, some corporations don't have to pay any  income tax, so for them, freedom day is New Year's day.  In "celebration" of that day, in Vancouver, the BC Federation of Labour will be  holding a (battery operated) "corporate" pig race at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. Kinesis  hopes to be able to bring you some photos of the winners (and losers) next month.  Besides being the month when the budget comes down, February is a also Black  History Month. In this issue, we bring you two stories in recognition of Black History  Month: a profile of Sister Vision Press: Black Women and Women of Colour Press [on  page 10,] and a review of an anthology of Black lesbian writings, Afrekete [see page 13.]  We hope you enjoy reading these articles.  Well, that's all for now...we've got to go to press... Until next month, happy Lunar  new year (February 19th) and happy reading.  v a mv.mi v •• *»s r at v * * or * w out- n  Thanks  Our appreciation to the following supporters who became members, renewed  their memberships or donated to Vancouver Status of Women in December and  January.

FEBRUARY 1996 Homophobia and Canada Customs:  News  Little Sisters wins (mostly)  by Fatima Jaffer  As Kinesis goes to press, the BC Supreme Court ruled on the Little Sisters case.  Below, Kinesis reports on the decision in  brief. In our March 1996 issue, Kinesis will  be running an in-depth feature on the case.  The long, long, long wait for a BC  Supreme Court decision on Little Sisters' case against Canada Customs finally ended last month in semi-sweet  victory.  Itismorethanadecadesince Canada  Customs began seizing shipments of  books and magazines headed for Little  Sisters, Vancouver's gay and lesbian  bookstore (the year Brian Mulroney's  Conservatives took office;. And it is more  than five years since Little Sisters and  the BC Civil Liberties Association  (BCLA) jointly filed a constitutional challenge against Canada Customs for its  homophobic harassment of the bookstore.  But on February 19th, there were no  more delays or stays. The BC Supreme  Court finally found that Canada Customs has indeed been "systemically"  discriminating against gay and lesbians  in Canada.  In its ruling, the court agreed with  Little Sisters and the BCLA that Canada  Custom's application of the law, which  allows customs officers to censor material entering the country using an arbitrary method of determining what is  "obscene" or promotes "hate," violates  sections of the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms that guarantee equality and  freedom of expression.  "We see this as a landmark case,"  says Little Sisters' Janine Fuller. "It has  validated the concerns of gay and les  bian booksellers in the community who  have been saying for the last decade that  Canada Customs is discriminatory."  But BCLA and Little Sisters lost on  their second contention that the Customs Act be struck down because it is  unconstitutional. The decision stops  short of striking the law down, which  means Canada Customs still has the  right to seize material at the border even  if it may have to rethink the way it does  that.  Fuller however is confident it is only  a matter of time before the law is struck  down. The bookstore and BCLA are  planning to ensure just that, in their  appeal to the BC Court of Appeal.  Says Fuller: "We think it is winnable  based on what is written in the course of  this judgment."  Little Sisters has also applied for an  injunction against Canada Customs to  stop all seizures until the appeal has  been heard. "There is a sort of hidden  message within the judgment that is  giving us the sense that this is a worthy  course to pursue," Fuller points out.  Meanwhile, Little Sisters' will continue its fundraising efforts to raise the  monies needed to pay legal costs of the  ongoing battle. The bill currently stands  at $250,000, though Fuller says community efforts and support—locally, nationally and internationally—have already  raised $190,000.

Sexual assault and the courts:  Records open to disclosure  by Robyn Hall  Women reacted with disappointment to two recent Supreme Court of  Canada decisions which continue to  make women's mental health and medical records available to the lawyers of  men accused of sexual assault.  The Court's rulings involved two  cases—O'Connor v. the Queen and  L.L.A. v. Beharriell.  In a 5-4 split decision, the Supreme  Court ruled on December 14 that women's personal records may have relevance in determining the outcome of  sexual assault trials, and therefore can  be turned over to defense lawyers and  introduced as evidence. These records  can be medical, therapeutic, employment or counselling records, compiled  at any time of a woman's life. The Supreme Court laid out a process for determining relevance of records.  The O'Connor case dealt with the  sexual assault trial of Bishop Hubert  O'Connor who had been charged with  sexually assaulting four First Nations  women at a Williams Lake, BC residential school in the 1960s. In 1992, his trial  was stopped, partly because the judge  did not have confidence that Crown  lawyers had handed over to the defense  all the information about the complainants to which they were entitled.  While the Supreme Court's decision  addressed the broader issue of disclosure, it also ruled that Hubert O'Connor  must stand trial on the charges.  The second case, LLA v. Beharriell,  concerned an appeal by the complainant  and two counselling centres of a court  order requiring them to disclose the  cused's lawyers. The counselling centres had refused.  December's Supreme Court ruling  means that counselling centres and other  record holders may still be required to  turn over their records. In the Beharriell  case, the records in question must now  be evaluated for relevance based on the  new criteria set out by the Court.  In ruling that women's personal  records could be disclosed if they proved  relevant to the outcome of the trial, the  majority of the Supreme Court judges  gave three reasons for supporting that  position.  They said that the records may hold  information about the events leading up  to the pressing of charges against the  accused; may reveal the use of a therapy  which influenced the woman's memory  of the assault; and may speak to the  woman's credibility, including the quality of her perception of the assaultaround  the time it occurred, and her memory of  it since.  These reasons appear to be informed  by the myth that women lie about being  sexually assaulted, and are prone to  fantasy and "false memory."  They also create a very broad concept of what records will be relevant in  trials, says Christine Boyle, a professor  law at the University of British Columbia.  "[The Supreme Court] set up a process of disclosure that should be relatively easy for the defense to meet," says  Boyle. "These are very broad conceptions of relevance, and I think very likely  there will be disclosure in a lot of cases."  In their decision, the majority justices  often be necessary in order to provide  the accused with a fair trial.  Boyle is also a board member of  West Coast Women's Legal Education  and Action Fund (West Coast LEAF).  LEAF and three other women's organizations—the Aboriginal Women's Council, the Canadian Association of Sexual  Assault Centres, and the Dis Abled Women's Network Canada—intervened as a  coalition in the cases before the Supreme  Court to make equality rights arguments.  The Coalition argued that disclosure must be interpreted as a women's  equality issue because sexual assault is a  crime perpetrated overwhelmingly by  men against women. They further argued that women's personal records  should not be disclosed in sexual offence cases since the records are never  relevant because they were not made for  the purpose of providing evidence at a  trial, but for therapeutic or medical reasons.  The Supreme Court decision lays  out a two-part test to be administered by  individual judges in determining  whether or not personal records should  be handed over to the accused. The judge  must be convinced of the "likely relevance" of particular records to the case  by the defense.  The Court says the test is intended  to ensure judges keep in mind the right  of the complainant to privacy and the  right of the accused to a fair trial. The  court laid out seven criteria records must  meet in order to be disclosed. The first  two involve the rights of the accused  person—the records must be necessary  for the defense of the accused, and the  records must have value in proving guilt  or innocence.  Other criteria listed concerned with  the rights of complainants. Judges are  supposed to take into account: the expectation of privacy vested in the  records; whether the disclosure of the  record would be based on any discriminatory belief or bias; whether disclosure  will harm the complainants' dignity,  privacy or security; and the extent to  which production of the record would  deter the reporting of sexual offenses or  make victims reluctant to seek treatment.  The Court also said that judges  should consider generally how producing or not producing the record would  affect the integrity of the trial, and when  deciding that the production of records  is warranted, it should only happen in  the manner and to the extent necessary  to maintain this integrity.  Women are now urging the federal  government to create a legislative solution on the disclosure issue. Sharon  Mclvor, who acted as co-counsel for the  Coalition says, "The courts are obviously not going to do it, so the only other  alternative is to have the Parliament  enact legislation that gives women some  protection."  The federal Minister of Justice has  been working on drafting legislation,  and several members of the Coalition  have been a part of the consultation  process.

FEBRUARY 1996 __ News  Bashing poor people and welfare:  Media carries  conservative agenda  by Andrea Imada   The recent BC Auditor General's  report has provided another opportunity for poor-bashers to forward their  agenda of maligning low income people  and fueling public sentiment against  social programs—this time by pointing  the finger at welfare fraud.  The release of the annual provincial  government audit in January prompted  national headlines such as, "Welfare  scams in BC costing millions of dollars,"  adding to a media fervour bent on stigmatizing people receiving welfare as  criminals, while ignoring the real cause  of rising welfare costs: the lack of living  wage jobs.  "People on welfare are made out to  be either lazy or fraud artists," says  Linda Moreau of End Legislated Poverty (ELP), a BC-based anti-poverty  group. She adds that this prevailing  portrayal of welfare recipients promotes  hatred against a certain group of people  and certain individuals, and further  erodes the public's support for social  programs.  The focus on fraud is also assisting  the BC government in forwarding its  agenda of cutting back spending on social programs by providing it with a  perfect scapegoat: hype over trumped-  up welfare fraud.  The provincial government's own  targeting of poor people and welfare  recipients include its introduction of a  three-month residency requirement in  order to qualify for welfare, and its regressive "BC Benefits" social assistance  'reform' package, which will hurt low  income women and single mothers who  receive social assistance [see Kinesis,  December/January 1996.]  Mainstream media news articles cite  BC's welfare costs as having doubled  over the past five years, and juxtapose  the figure of $1.8 billion (the total cost of  the program) with words such as "fraud"  and "abuse." The combination results in  the implication that fraud is the culprit  responsible for rising welfare costs.  Moreau says instances of low income individuals defrauding the welfare program are extremely rare. ELP  places the actual rate of fraud at two to  three percent, but says that the media's  portrayal can make it seem as though  fraud is out of control at levels of 40 or 50  percent. One Vancouver news report  about BC welfare used the example,  cited by an American official speaking  at the Right-wing Fraser Institute, that  fraud rates in California are at 50 percent.  More frequent what occurs is what  ELP calls "survival fraud;" that is, when  people just trying to make ends meet do  not report items they receive, such as a  bag of groceries or other small gifts.  Despite these facts, the media is trying its best to paint another picture. A  letter to the editor in the anti-poverty  newspaper, The Long Haul, reports that  BCTV sent a person to a Vancouver  social services office in an attempt to file  a false welfare claim (so they could prove  their point that it is easy to defraud the  welfare system). The claim was refused.

And meanwhile, barely a  whisper has been heard in the mainstream press about the federal Canadian Health and Social Transfer (CHST)  which comes into force on April 1st,  replacing the Canada Assistance Program (CAP) and essentially eliminating  most national standards for health and  social programs.  So what are the issues around rising  welfare costs the media is missing out  on? The main point is simple, says  Moreau. "People come here to look for  work and there are no jobs." Other barriers include low wages and a lack of  adequate childcare.  Moreau points out that increasing  difficulty in getting assistance can prevent women and children from leaving  abusive relationships. For many women  and children, social assistance can be "a  key step to get out of the house and not  be driven back by crummy conditions or  low wages."  "It's very hard to get on welfare,"  says Moreau, describing a rigorous and  often humiliating experience, in which  women applying for welfare must  present identification, hydro, telephone  and other bills, and bank account numbers, answer lots of questions, and sign  a release permitting social services to  carry out inquiries to these institutions  and their landlord.  DR. PAULETTE ROSCOE  NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN  HOMEOPATHY  COUNSELLING  DETOXIFICATION  HYCROFT MEDICAL CENTER  108-3195 GRANVILLE ST.  VANCOUVER, B.C. V6H 3K2  To get hardship welfare—which  must be paid back—social services can  require people to get an eviction notice  from their landlord.  The mainstream media and Right-  wing's focus on fraud is also illustrated  by the denigrating language being used  to describe welfare and its recipients.  "Saying 'Welfare creates dependency' is the conservative mantra right  now," says Moreau. "It creates the image that welfare in itself is a bad thing."  Repeated references to people receiving social assistance as welfare "users," liken welfare to drug use. Both  "dependency" and "users" carry the  negative association with substance  abuse or addiction.  The question that needs to be asked  is: "Who benefits when people on welfare are made out to be criminals?," says  Moreau. "It benefits corporate lobby  groups who are trying to destroy the  social programs so they can have cheap  labour—desperate cheap labour."  End Legislated Poverty is striving to inform  the public about this and other farms of "poor-  bashing" with a province-wide campaign. "Stop  Poor Bashing" posters are available from their  offices. The group is also collecting pledges from  politicianswho are running in upcoming municipal and provincial elections to stop poor bashing.  Call (604) 879-1209.

A message from the Public Service Alliance of Canada   •   (604) 430-5631  FEBRUARY 1996 News  Sandy Merriman emergency shelter in Victoria:  Built by women  for women  by Julia Caslin  Sandy Merriman House, Victoria's  new emergency shelter, had been working to improve the lives of the city's  homeless women long before its doors  were officially opened at the end of December. The process of making the project  a reality itself involved the women the  shelter was intended to help.  The house is unique for Victoria in  several ways: it is the first shelter exclusively for women; street women played  an active role in its development, providing input for the finished product; and  the women targeted as its users were  trained in construction and helped build  the centre.  Sandy Merriman House offers 15  emergency beds, counselling, referrals  and peer support for women in Victoria's downtown core, many of whom  spend or have spent time living and  working on the city's streets. It is estimated that up to 250 women are homeless or at risk in Victoria.  Chris Downing, the shelter's coordinator, says a series of public meetings  concluded there was a need for women  to have a safe place to go. She says that  other shelters were used predominantly  by men, and most women felt uncomfortable or unsafe using these shelters,  and in many cases they preferred to stay  on the street.  Jannit Rabinovitch says she recognized this void and proposed a project  targeting the city's homeless and at-risk  women. In the summer of 1993, she submitted a proposal to the Ministry of  Health's Healthy Community Initiative  Fund. Rabinovitch has acted as the  project's coordinator.  She says the first challenge was locating homeless and at-risk women willing to talk about their needs. "The visible  homeless—those who use the shelters  and soup kitchens—are the men," says  Rabinovitch. "It took months to find individuals in this 'invisible community'."  With funding from all three levels of  government—the City of Victoria, the  Ministry of the Attorney General, Victim  Services and the Secretary of State—  Rabinovitch assembled a six-person consulting team: herself, three homeless  women, an outreach worker, and a writer  to document the process.  The team organized public meetings  in which 35 to 60 women attended. The  women made it clear that at the forefront  of their needs was an emergency shelter  and long-term housing for single adults.  Rabinovitch says there are facilities  for seniors and families, but very few for  single adult women. "Rents are quite  high and that left some women in dangerous situations without choice," she  says.  The women also conveyed the message that they lacked access to training  Women on site at the Sandi Merriman House in Victoria.

They wanted  a program where they could be themselves.  After consultations, various government ministries agreed that building an emergency shelter would be the  first phase of a larger plan to create  integrated services for street women, a  plan which would include long-term  housing.  More than $636,000 of funding for  the construction of Sandy Merriman  House was provided by BC21 [infrastructure investment program] and the  ministries of Social Services, Women's  Equality, and Skills, Training and Labour. BC Housing purchased a $450,000  bed and breakfast located just outside  Victoria'sdowntowncore, which would  be converted into the emergency shelter . The existing house, built in the 1900s,  had to be gutted because it was structurally unsound.  Organizers of the project felt  strongly that homeless and at-risk  women—the women who would use  the facility,—should be trained to help  build the home. But the general practice  in the construction industry was to put  jobs out to tender, which meant more  often than not that jobs went to construction companies which hired men,  and rarely women.  Rabinovitch says they found a loophole, in that there were no programs in  place for the construction of shelters.  Because there were no established programs, there were no rules. This opened  the door for convincing the government to agree to fund a program to  train homeless and at-risk women to  build Sandy Merriman House.  By the fall of 1994, trainees were  being recruited for the construction  project. Project coordinators put the  word out to agencies and on the street  that the project was accepting applications from long-term social assistance  recipients who had a history of addictions, but had been clean and sober and  were genuinely interested in learning  construction.  After a month they had 50 applicants. Twenty women were chosen for  the training program. "For a lot of these  women, it was the first time they ever  filled out an application form," says  Rabinovitch.  Three women were hired to teach  construction, math, and lifeskills, and  another to serve as a counsellor.  By April 1995, when it was time to  go to the construction site, 12 women  were left in the program. With a female  construction manager, electrician,  plumber, carpenters and the 12 trainees,  there was a five to one ratio of women to  men.  Some women left voluntarily; others were asked to leave because they  were still actively using drugs and /or  alcohol.  While the project gave hope to many  of the participants, there was also some  despair. The shelter is named in memory  of Sandy Merriman, a trainee who died  of a heroin overdose during construction.  For many women, the project helped  improve their self-esteem, but it also  stirred up a lot of old feelings.  "Being in the project, the women  were safer than before, but historical  abuse issues surfaced and many had to  deal with them," says Rabinovitch. "One  grew very depressed and dealt with it  through counselling and grew stronger  because of it. Others couldn't consistently stay with that process. Things  changed for a lot of them at different  points."  Karen Tuey, a single mother who  participated in the program, says she  struggled with alcohol and drug problems, which finally led her to quit her job  of eight years so she could fully concentrate on recovery.  Tuey says the construction work  was physically hard and dirty, but that  she continued with the project because  of the lifeskills training. "It had an incredible impact on my life," says Tuey.  "It explained why I did the things that I  did, why I felt the things that I did. I had  always been a quitter. And I wanted to  finish this thing I started."  There were many times Tuey says  that she felt like giving up on the program. "It wasn't because of the hard  work, but because I had to deal with  issues during the lifeskills which were  very painful memories," she says. "I  had buried things for several years and  it was painful and scary. I wanted to  run."  With the help of a private counsellor, paid for by the project, Tuey resolved many issues.  "I feel like this is what I was meant  to do and why a lot of things happened  to me. 1 was given a gift of recovery," she  says. "I was ashamed of my past. I  thought I was insane and from the bottom of my heart I thought I was a flawed  human being. I'm excited about life today. If I can help one woman cross over  and feel even a little of what I'm feeling  today, then I'll be happy."  The experience of working on the  shelter differed for each woman, but  Chris Downing says there is a common  link. "The key thing for me is the development of their self esteem. Many had  very low self esteem. All their lives they  were told, 'you can't do anything,' and  now they can look at this house and say,  1 did that'."  Karen Tuey is now working as a  support worker for the shelter, helping  other women in similar situations. Another project participant works as the  maintenance manager of the shelter.  Some of the other v/omen have found or  are seeking employment, and some have  continued onto other apprenticeship  programs and school. Others have decided they are not ready for a full time  job.  Sandy Merriman house still faces  tough challenges. Since it opened in  December, the house has been operating  at capacity. Unlike other transition  houses and emergency shelters, the  house has yet to put a limit on the length  of stay. It is open to homeless and at-risk  women between the hours of 7pm and  Ham. The shelter's objective is to operate 24 hours, but its current funding  dictates only a 16-hour day.   Julia Caslin is a Vancouver freelance  writer. This is her first article for Kinesis.

Kinesis burglarized  Thieves took some of the spirit out  of the holiday season for the Vancouver  Status of Women, Kinesis and Aquelarre,  a Latin-American women's publication.  Not one, but two December burglaries,  at our Vancouver offices left us without  computers, printers, fax machine, TV/  VCR, and other electronic equipment.  The theft has already claimed an  inordinate amount of time and energy,  as staff and volunteers work towards  replacing the equipment. It has also put  a wrench in the production of upcoming  issues, as staff work on replacing lost  databases, templates, and other precious  computer files that are sitting on a hard  drive somewhere out there.  Fortunately, much of our loss is covered by insurance, though we still have  to deal with deductibles and the fact that  our insurance premiums will go up.  Aquelarre, which lost its database of  subscribers and supporters in the theft,  is currently attempting to rebuild its  database by gathering names, addresses  and phone numbers of subscribers.

The training kit, produced in BC,  consists of a video with a follow-up  modular training guide that shows how  popular education can be used for organizing. Both the video and the guide  give examples of concrete methods and  tools to work with, in the present context of local and global restructuring.  The video focuses on two different  groups of women activists who use a  variety of different popular education  methods to raise questions and discuss  their work. The guide is written by  Denise Nadeau; the video is directed by  Dorothy Kidd working with Rani Gill,  Nora Randall and Bonnie  McCorquondale.  Topics include: doing social analysis; culture; history and resistance; popular communication; spirituality, religion  and organizing; design and facilitation;  applying skills; alternatives and planning for action; evaluating and systematizing our work.  The kit is available to individuals at  a cost of $39.95 or to unions, institutions  and organizations at $80. The video and  training guide are also sold separately.

The VLC is inviting proposals from  groups of lesbians who would commit  to carrying out the much-needed task of  reorganizing, restructuring and operating the VLC.  In the past, VLC's decision-making  body has been the VLC collective. Members of the collective took on long-term  responsibility for the entire organization. The board delegated its power to  the collective.  The past two years at the VLC have  been particularly stressful and many  collective members moved on to new  pursuits. In the fall, the remaining members asked old collective members to  come back and help out. Several agreed  to become board members, specifying  they would only take on organizational  restructuring and finances.  Eventually, most of the remaining  Collective resigned, leaving the board  with full responsibility for the organization, which it is not in any position to  carry out.  After considering many options, the  VLC board have decided the best solution is to find a new group with a relatively clean slate to take over operation  of the well-established lesbian centre.  Information packages may be picked  up at the VLC or at Harry's on Charles  Street (off Commercial) or by phoning  Bet or Storm at 254-8458; by writing the  VLC at 1490 East 20th, Vancouver, V5N  2K6; or by faxing 875-9592. Address all  communication "Attention VLC Proposals." The deadline for preliminary proposals is February 28. Final decisions  will be made by the VLC board in April.  The VLC is expected to be in new hands  by April 30, otherwise it will close.

The deaths are officially  recorded as "suicide," and so the perpetrators are not held accountable and the  government has taken no action to ensure the violence and isolation ends.  The campaign was launched in Toronto in January by the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women,  Parkdale Community Legal Services,  Tamil Resource Centre, Kursikai and  the Shakti Kee Chatree.  The main focus of the campaign is to  ensure that both the men involved and  the federal government are held responsible for these deaths and for ensuring  future prevention of and protection from  the abuse and violence.  The campaign is primarily aimed at  pressuring the government, as service  providers, to be accountable for providing services which will lessen the isolation for these women. In particular, the  campaign will lobby for provision of  culturally specific services, language  training, childcare and affordable housing, to ensure women will have options  other than suicise to get out of abusive  situations.  Preliminary stages of the campaign  are to help the dead women's families  gain custody of the children, who currently continue to reside in the abusive  household. As well, the campaign will  focus on seeking justice for the women  by bringing criminal charges against the  men involved.

Making the economy  work for women  International and local speakers will  present discussions on money, women,  poverty and action in Vancouver and  other locations in the Lower Mainland  starting February 6th.  Four presentations have been scheduled, covering themes such as: Who is  Paying the Debt? The Impact of Deficit  Reduction Hysteria; Economic Violence  Against Women: An Inevitable Fate?;  Community Economic Planning:  Through the Eyes of Women; and Working Together for Food Security: Locally  and Globally.  The series is open to all women's  groups, collectives and the general public. Childcare funds will be available.  Among groups involved in the organizing are Oxfam Canada, NAC-BC,  Centre for Research in Women's Studies  and Gender Relations, and the Trade  Union Group.  It is hoped that these series will be a  starting point from which women will  be able to share what actions they are  currently undertaking, as well as to  strategize on future actions that can and  should be taken in response to global  economic restructuring.  For more information, call Oxfam at  736-7678 or NAC-BC at 876-4119.  HUGS AND KISSES  FROM KINESIS!"

D<f  FEBRUARY 1996 Feature  Conservatism in the north:  The rising of the Right  by Mab Segrest  Mob Segrest participated at a plenary titled, "The rise of conservatism: identifying the issues," at the  NGO Women's Forum in Huairou,  China last September. Below is an  excerpt from her speech in which she  addresses the history and rise of the  Right-wing conservative agenda in  the north (US, Canada, and Europe).  Segrest currently coordinates the  US Urban Rural Mission of the World  Council of Churches, and sits on the  board of the Center for Democratic  Renewal which works to counter  antidemocratic movements within the  US. She organized for seven years  against grassroots fascist movements  in her home state of North Carolina.  She is a lesbian writer, activist and  mother. Her most recent book is  Memoir of a Race Traitor.  My country in 1995 is a country both propelled forward and  rushing backward. Like the many  countries represented at this conference, we are propelled forward  by a new era of capitalism. Computers are restructuring the global assembly line, and now the  comparative advantage of countries of the south is not only raw  materials, as it was in the earliest  stages of colonialism, but also  cheap labour. With a tremendous  capital mobility that comes when  money is an electronic impulse,  jobs flee south and people flood  the north. Within the US over the  past 20 years, this conservatism  has worked its backlash to various people's movements, which  I'm sure has been brought to you  by CNN and by fundamentalist  Christian broadcasting. Its roots  are in the not-so-ancient regime of  colonizers, who fought genocidal  wars against Indigenous people  to claim ownership of land that  they would then steal Africans to  work. These practices required a  range of justifications that shape  and manifest destiny—class inflected by race, inflected by gender.  The greatest early victory  against these forces in US history  was the abolition of slavery. The  13th, 14th, and 15th amendments  to the US Constitution erected a  legal wall abolishing slavery, prohibiting the denial of the vote on  the basis of race, creed or previous condition of servitude, and  ensuring due process of law, equal  Women exposing the enclosing curtains of the Right.

The early 20th century brought  a labour movement that improved  working conditions. The 30s  brought a "new deal" in response  to uprisings, [to help] people hurt  by the depression and to put in  place parts of the welfare state.

It was at this moment of burgeoning liberation that what we in  the US call the "new Right" was  born. After a devastating electoral  defeat in 1964, the old Right elite  saw they needed a populous base  and a new facade—there are only  so many people who will vote for  rich people getting much richer.  They saw that resentments to liberation movements of the 60s  could provide them this.  Conservative business nationalists like Joseph Coors and Nelson Hunt donated millions to fund  conservative infrastructures to  define ideologies and strategies  for mobilizing this mass base.  Hunt, for example, donated $10  million to Pat Robertson's Christian broadcast network in 1970,  politicizing Robertson and other  evangelical TV ministers around  issues of abortion, homosexuality, and prayer in the schools. Today, Christian broadcast networks  are the single most-listened-to  broadcast media in the world.  When the old Right moved to  defend itself against new challenges, corporate officials also  made their decision to de-industrialize the US. Faced with growing foreign competition, they knew  we could either increase productivity and improve our products,  or cut labour costs. They went after labour, moving plants overseas or to Mexico where they could  save $20,000 per worker a year,  resulting in the loss of 1.8 million  manufacturing jobs in the US between 1981 and 1991.  Automation is perhaps an even  greater threat to the status of the  American worker. More than 75  percent of the labour force in most  industrialized countries engages  in work that's little more than simple repetitive tasks. This means  that more than 90 million of the  125 million-person labour force in  the US could potentially be replaced by machines. Given both  plant relocation and automation,  corporate re-engineering could result in the loss of 1 to 2.5 million  jobs a year in my country in the  foreseeable future. Two-thirds of  the new jobs created are at the  bottom of the wage pyramid.  Now this is a mess. And the US  electorate remains dangerously  uninformed of what is happening.  Its main tool to grasp these rapidly changing conditions are the  scapegoated ideologies hatched  and promoted by conservative  strategists     and     propagated  Continued next page  FEBRUARY 1996 Feature  The rising of the Right continued from page 7  through corporate-controlled media and massively funded electoral campaigns.  In the US, policies are often the  same as those under structural adjustment programs (SAPs) in the  south—slashing social programs,  reducing wages, privatizing previously government functions,  deregulating capital, and increasing the police state.  Historically, racism and sexism, and more recently  homophobia, had kept most people profoundly confused about the  class system and vulnerable to  ideological narratives that blame  the victim and point away from  corporate decision makers. The  core of these scapegoating narratives is racist: the concept of reverse discrimination. The story  persuades people of European descent who are still a significant,  though falling, majority in the US  that two civil rights laws of the  1960s achieved an even playing  field in a society that is now 'colour blind.' Attempts to address  centuries of inequity by affirmative action programs are 'reverse  discrimination,' and the most oppressed group in the US now, they  would say, is white men.  When white people lose their  jobs, they often believe it is the  fault of poorly qualified people of  colour who they think are hired by  affirmative action, and not the  fault of multinationals who are  eliminating two million jobs a year  [applause]. If working people have  lower real wages, propaganda tells  them the problem is not the laws  or the wage structure, but that  they're paying too many taxes to  this welfare state, so what they  should do is cut taxes. But they  manage to cut taxes to the rich  people instead of the middle class  and poor people.  We are facing a society in which  75 percent of the jobs will be lost to  automation, yet many Americans  have been persuaded to believe  poverty is created by failure of  personal responsibility, and the  main drain on the economy is payments to welfare mothers, who  are imagined as exclusively  women of colour although 38 percent are white.

As a lesbian, it is clear to me  that what's happening within the  US and internationally is not only  the masculinization of the state,  not only its racialization, but also  its heterosexualization—its attempt to reassert itself as  normatively, supremely heterosexual.  One example was a codification of sexuality laws in Trinidad  and Tobago in 1986 and in the  In the US, policies are often the same  as those under structural adjustment programs  (SAPs) in the south—slashing social programs,  reducing wages, privatizing previously  government functions, deregulating capital, and  increasing the police state.  Bahamas in 1989. My friend Jackie  Alexander, a Trinidadian lesbian,  has brilliantly analyzed these laws.  In 1989 the Bahamas imposed a  sentence of up to 20 years in prison  for lesbian sexuality. At the same  time, they criminalized rape  within marriage.  Jackie has written, "the state  had eroticized the disillusion of  the nation producing apocalyptic  visions of dread and destruction  brought on by the prostitution and  the practices of lesbians and gay  sex. Yet simultaneously, it enacts  the disillusion of the nation  through the introduction of multinational capital and tourism,  which appears integral to the natural order as heterosexuality. This  involves, among other things, the  symbolic triumph of the nuclear  family over extended and other  family forms and a masculinity  wounded by racism and colonialism seeks to reconstitute the nation to redeem itself."  These policies echo developments in the US where the personal responsibility laws require  that mothers up to 20-years-old  must marry to receive aid [given]  to families with dependent children, with the money [the government 'saves' by not giving it to  unmarried mothers'] directed into,  among other things, orphanages  into which [the government puts]  the confiscated, illegitimate children of poor women. How many  of the world's children are born  outside of heterosexual legal marriage, and are they all being abandoned as well in the  heterosexualization of the state?  The lesbian and gay movement  in the US, deeply divided by race,  class and gender, would have  much to learn in a global movement that does not replicate our  own narrowly nationalistic version of ourselves as queer. We  should rather all be, in a South  African term, ubuntu: born to belonging.  At stake in this global struggle  between capitalism and community is our ability to create communities not based on exclusion,  but in which no one is expendable  either to profits or to rigid community norms. Either we are all  ubuntu, or some of us are born to  privilege: we can't have it both  ways. Feature  Ontario women's declaration against the Harris cuts:  "We are not going back!"  An unprecedented assembly of  women representing more than 140 organizations from all regions of Ontario  launched the Ontario Women's Declaration in Toronto on December 6th.  The Declaration, titled "We are not  going back," declares opposition to the  discriminatory policies of the Mike Harris  Conservative government in Ontario and  demands changes to the way it governs  the province. The Ontario women are  calling on the Harris government to respond to the demands by International  Women's Day (March 8).  Kinesis presents excerpts from the  Declaration below. Also note the speech  on economic conservatism on pages 7-8.  WHEREAS the Conservative government of Mike Harris has announced a staggering 8 billion dollar  spending cut, including cuts of $800  million in education, $1.3 billion in  hospital spending, and $1.4 billion in  transfers to municipalities, representing 47 percent of their transfers in the  next two years; and whereas it has  taken the following steps since coming to power last June:  • a 21.6 percent reduction in social assistance recipients' allowances;  • the elimination of grants for  new non-profit child care centres;  • cutbacks in transportation services for disabled people;  • the elimination of funding for  the prevention of spousal abuse [including second-stage shelter housing  for battered women];  • cutbacks in immigrant settlement programs;  • deep cuts in funding for the arts  and culture;  • elimination of funding for new  abortion clinics;  • a reduction in funding for social  services adapted to the specific needs  of cultural and racial minorities;  • cutbacks in the French-language  services provided by municipalities  and a number of government departments;  • elimination of funding for the  gay and lesbian youth counselling  telephone line;  • the abolition of the Employment Equity Act;  • the abolition of the Jobs Ontario  job creation program;  • deep cutbacks in funding for  low-income, cooperative and not-for-  profit housing, and the privatization  of public housing;  • cutbacks in funding for health  services in hospitals and home care;  • the abolition of Bill 40, which  prohibited the use of strikebreakers;  • allowing user fees on all drugs  received by seniors and people receiving social assistance;  • allowing community colleges  and universities to raise tuition fees  by 15 and 20 percent, respectively;  WHEREAS the Harris government has announced its intention to  take the following measures within  the near future:  • the cUsmantling of rent control  legislation;  • the introduction of workfare;  • cutbacks in the legal aid budget;  • the elimination of legal clinics  such as the Pay Equity Advocacy and  Legal Services;  • a watering down of the environmental protection regulations;  • cutbacks in the procedures for  monitoring the health and safety of  working women, such as inspection  of hazardous working conditions;  • abolition of the subsidies for  68,000 daycare spaces;  • a redefinition of the concept of  disability, and possible elimination  of the financial support given to thousands of disabled persons;  WHEREAS the government is  threatening to cut back funding to  women's groups who criticize its policies, thereby demonstrating lack of  understanding of the role of these  groups in the democratic process and  an attitude similar to that of abusive  men who try to control their partners  through threats and violence;  WHEREAS the Harris government has aligned itself with international finance and business interests  in limiting the role of state intervention to action that will benefit only  the affluent class, and has already  committed itself to the following policies:  • the abolition of annual filing  fees for corporations, at a cost of $15  million to the public treasury;  • a 30 percent reduction in in^  come taxes in the next three years for  a total loss in government revenue of  $5 billion;  WHEREAS the immediate and future effects of these measures will be:  • increased poverty for the most  vulnerable women;  • increased poverty of children;  • a deterioration in housing conditions and increased homelessness;  • a loss of autonomy for disabled  people;  • continued barriers to employment tor women, and in particular  women of colour, Aboriginal women  and disabled women;  • increased family violence;  • increased unemployment, with  a predicted direct job loss of 4300 and  an indirect loss of up to 120,000 jobs;  • increased vulnerability of working women to sexual and racial harassment;  We can only conclude that the  Harris government is waging a veritable war against women.  We believe that the policies being  implemented by the government violate the fundamental rights of women  that are guaranteed by the Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms and  international human rights law. For  example:  •The cutbacks in social assistance violate the right to "an adequate  standard of living... including adequate food, clothing and housing,  and to the continuous improvement  of living conditions" as guaranteed in  the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (article 11).  • The introduction of workfare  will violate the right to a "freely chosen or accepted" job, and the right to  "just and favorable conditions,"  "equal remuneration for work of  equal value" without discrimination,  as guaranteed in the International  Covenant on Economic, Social and  Cultural Rights (articles 6 and 7).  • The cutbacks in support programs for battered women and in  domestic violence prevention programs endanger the life, liberty and  physical and psychological security  of women, protected in the Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms (section 7).  We hereby put the Harris government on notice that it must forthwith  cease its policies of cutbacks; they are  discriminatory and they are destroying the services and support networks  that have been developed over the  last thirty years.  We demand that this government  radically reorient its approach to the  administration of public affairs, and  we call on it to govern fairly and  equitably, and to refrain from exer  cising its power solely in the interests  of big business and businessmen.  • Its administration must be egalitarian; that is, it must tend to decrease, and not increase, the social  and economic disadvantages of  women, and of men in historically  disadvantaged groups;  • Its administration must be equitable; that is, it must accord equal  protection and benefit to women and  men of all colours, ethnic or cultural  origins, sexual orientation and social  status, in terms of both its policy and  program objectives and the methods  by which they are administered;  • Its administration must be legal, and it must be consistent with the  universal principles of fundamental  justice. In particular, it must respect  human dignity and freedom and the  equality and independence of women;  • Its actions must be guided by  the principle of universality, and its  programs must be delivered effectively and efficiently to everyone living within the province's borders.  We demand that the government  order an immediate moratorium on  all cutbacks or reductions in services  that might increase the disadvantage  suffered by women.  We the women of Ontario consider that this is a state of emergency.  We formally notify the government  of Ontario that if it continues to attack the rights of women, we will  take all steps necessary to secure, and  defend our legitimate rights. Women's groups will not bow down to  threats and attacks by the government.  We will resist all forms of subordination.  For more information, call Andree Cote  or Katryn Penwill at (416) 923-9292.

Co-founded in 1985 by Stephanie Martin  and Makeda Silvera, Sister Vision has always had as its focus publishing innovative,  challenging and provocative works by Black  women, First Nations women, Asian women  and women of mixed racial heritage.  Last month, Kinesis had the opportunity to speak with Martin and Silvera while  they were in Vancouver about their commitment to publishing and their reflections on  Sister Vision's 10 years.  Agnes Huang: The name is Sister  Vision: Black Women and Women of  Colour Press. Why did you choose this  name?  Makeda Silvera: Ten years ago when  we started the press, we were in search  of a name. And as you can imagine, we  went through dozens of possible names  and none seemed just right.  So there we were: two women, two  feminists in a sister movement, with an  incurable vision (laughs).  In 1984, you could count on one  hand the number of Black women in this  country who had single-authored published books; you could also count quite  easily ones who had published creative  pieces in anthologies. It's sad when you  think about it, because we did not just  arrive in this country yesterday...as illiterates.  Stephanie Martin: When we founded  the press, there was also the beginnings  of a women's community which defined  themselves as a group—as women of  colour from different racial and cultural  backgrounds. We use the term women  of colour to be inclusive of those women  who, like ourselves, did not have a place  in contemporary Canadian literature.  Our alliances over the years have been  with Aboriginal women, Black women,  Asian women and mixed race women,  and those voices are reflected in the  books we publish.  Huang: Can you talk more about  why Sister Vision Press was started?  Martin: We started Sister Vision to  address the issue of non-representation  and lack of voice. There were few women  of colour who had their individual work  iti ftf iliiif  As one of the earlier Black writers in  the small but active Black literary community in Toronto, I can speak confidently about the silent resistance of publishers to take chances and publish our  works. So in a way, this naming is my  taking personal responsibility in a movement and making identity the focus.  in print at the time, and they were not  being published by mainstream presses.  The few feminist and small presses during this period were also not interested  in the voices of women of colour...  Silvera: They were not interested in  what we had to say or how we wanted to  say it. For the most part, the issues—  class and colour—were not a part of  their feminist analysis.  I think also that as a young Caribbean woman of African descent involved  in political activism in the Black community in the 1970s and 80s—and I know  I speak here not alone—I began to question my value in Black community organizations, my identity as Black and  feminist, and the lack of understanding  or willingness to address issues of sexism within those organizations.  And for many of us who were lesbians and/or coming out or questioning  our sexuality, we found that we could  not carry all our selves or multiple identities, if you may, to the dinner table. In  fact, we felt very isolated in those groups,  and with that said, our voices were stifled...and if that was not enough, we  also found that as writers. At that time,  the very few Black publishers who were  around were extremely selective...to a  fault.  Lesbians were unheard of in many  of the women of colour communities, so  no one was going to take a chance to  publish something that didn't exist. It  was important for us to take that journey.  There were other writers who were  experimenting with "dialect" or dub  poetry, who found little support for their  work from earlier Black publishers. We  wanted to read books that talked about  us; books that brought back reminders  of a grandmother, a friend, a particular  phrase, down home, people we grew up  with, food...and images that were family. Books that talked the talk we talked.  Huang: Are your reasons for continuing with Sister Vision today the same  as those that lead you to start the press  10 years ago?  Martin: Yes. Ten years later our  mandate remains the same: a commitment—strong as ever—to putting in  print the voices of women of colour and  to publishing the work of first time writers.  Silvera: I guess I could just say ditto,  but I want to add that we continue because we are ground-breakers, and we  can, however slowly, see the rewards of  our work. We have managed to actively  maintain a network of writers, artists,  booksellers, readers right across this  country and internationally too. We continue because we have created a vibrant  literary political identity in North  America. We are one of only two presses  owned and managed by women of colour in a white male dominated industry.  Huang: Sister Vision is not strictly a  publishing company; in many ways you  are also like a community group. Would  you agree? And how do you see the role  of Sister Vision Press in relation to the  Black political scene in Toronto, the  women's movement, or the lesbian and  gay community?  Martin: No, I would not call us a  community group; we are a publishing  house. Our political mandate encompasses a whole set of groups of women,  who are in themselves different communities of artists. We publish women  who are feminists, lesbians, other front  line warriors who don't define themselves as feminists, but who are activists. We are a press working with artists  and women who write.  Silvera: I agree with Stephanie,  though I know what you're saying. There  is a danger in a press taking on that role  or even being viewed like that. We are in  the cultural business of publishing books.  We are in an industry where success and  visibility is synonymous with white, with  mainstream, with money, with having  access to the right club—we have none  of those things. So of course, our job as  publishers becomes even more difficult.  We have to be focused.  True, some days the phone rings  constantly, people with questions that  have nothing to do with publishing and  would be better suited for a community  group to answer...  Makeda  Martin: They call asking us to recommend a counsellor, asking about food  banks, wanting names of shelters for  battered women...  Silvera: ...or where a demonstration  is taking place. We help when we can,  but most times, we direct callers to the  phone books, or simply say we are a  publishing house. It's difficult, but it is a  necessary step for us.  What was the second part of that  question or did we answer it already?  daughter)  Huang: How do you see the role of  Sister Vision in relation to the Black  political scene, women's movement, or  to lesbian and gay politics?  regardless of the difficulties, the pressures, the years fraught with uncertainty,  limited funds, the lack of awareness to  some extent in society about the legitimate place for publishers of books by  women of colour, we have managed to  sustain the energy, the commitment, the  love and the fervour to keep that vision  alive.  Huang: How many women of colour writers has Sister Vision published?  For many of them, are you their first  publisher? Their only publisher?  Silvera: We are proud to say that to  date we have published 35 authors—35  women who have never published books  before, possibly only imagined a book of  We are a movement press.  We represent a new and forceful voice  in publishing. Many of our books are  about change, about a new way  of reading and thinking.  — Makeda Silvera —  Silvera: Let me say again that our  role is to work with and publish work by  women of colour. Obviously because of  who we are, we do play a significant role  in the shaping and accessibility of literature as it relates to these various communities. We are a movement press. We  represent a new and forceful voice in  publishing. Many of our books are about  change, about a new way of reading and  thinking. Simply put, we open space  and provide resources for women writers to challenge, to experiment with  words in print, to continue where our  militant aunts, grannies, mothers left  off.  Huang: Has your vision of what Sister Vision Press is evolved over the years?  Martin: Visions have a way of staying pure, shining through if you will. So  Photo of Makeda Silvera by Danny Ogilvie;  their own. Of course, this number does  not include the hundreds of women featured in our anthologies.  Martin: For many women, yes, we  are their first time publisher; for most,  their only. Many have subsequently been  published in collections by other publishers, including large mainstream publishers.  Huang: Speaking of anthologies-  Many of the books Sister Vision publishes are collections of writings, both  fiction and non-fiction. Why anthologies?  Silvera: Well, as the Editorial Director at the Press, I play a large role in the  development of manuscripts, in acquisitions, and working with first time writers. It can be very exciting, a real high  (laughs). It's all in the discovery, the  Stephanie Martin by Alvaro Goviea  working together, the intensity at times,  and often a fine writer develops. For  these reasons, I have a particular weakness for anthologies.  Martin: I would say we have published a number of anthologies because  they give a large cross-section of women  a voice—those who might never be published again but who have important  things to say. Anthologies provide space  to women who might never have dreamt  of being in print.  Silvera: Yeah, anthologies are like  literary journals, and can play a crucial  role in the development of new writers.  It is often a place to find your voice, a  place to meet writers and compare work.  Anthologies can also provide a political  forum, speaking to issues that might not  otherwise prove to be commercially viable to mainstream presses.  For example in 1991, we published  Piece of My Heart, which was a first—a  ground breaking anthology charting the  lives of lesbians of colour through essays, poetry, prose and testimonies. We  have also produced Creation Fire, an  extensive collection of poetry by Caribbean-born women, both English speaking and non-English speaking; Lionheart  Gal, life stories of Jamaican women; The  Very Inside, writings by lesbian and bisexual Asian women; and Plural Desires,  a collection of writings by bisexual  women.  Martin: Recently we published Black  Girl Talk, a collection of writings by  young Black women.  Silvera: The response to that book  has been great.  Huang: Has the focus of who and  what you publish changed along the  way?  Martin: Our commitment and our  focus remains the same. We have over  the years broadened that vision, but not  in terms of diluting the vision.  Silvera: It's like nurturing the vision,  giving it lots of sunlight and watching it  grow. Right Stephanie?  Martin: Yes. It's giving that vision  renewed energy.  Silvera: It is also moving with the  political climate—what is needed at this  time is to forge ahead, to build coalitions  and to work together with other like-  minded thinkers.  We are and have always been politically committed to making links with  other women of colour internationally.  We have and continue to work with  feminist women's organizations in the  Caribbean, Britain, Southern Africa, India and other countries.  We are also committed to working  with other feminist presses in Canada  and the US.  We recently worked with a group of  women on Plural Desires. The collective  included Jewish women, white women,  Asian and Black women. Up to that  point, we had only published women of  colour, so clearly this was broadening  our focus.  We met with the collective and spoke  to them about our mandate and agreed  to adopt the anthology, with the understanding that it would feature 50 percent works by women of colour. We  wanted to provide a forum for bisexual  women of colour, but we felt it important that, if they found some solidarity  with other bisexual women including  white and Jewish women who were actively anti-racist in their writings, we  would provide that forum.  Martin: One of our forthcoming anthologies is edited by a South Asian  writer. What makes this book different  from others we have done is that a significant number of the essays are written by white women. It is a collection of  works dealing with issues of race and  gender.  For a while it created a dilemma.  The editor really wanted to publish with  us. Finally, based on the quality of the  work, and after having had several discussions with the editor and some of the  contributors, we decided to adopt this  collection.  Silvera: The question becomes one  of, do you penalize a woman of colour  because she has edited a collection which  includes works by white women? This  also brought up the question: why can't  a woman of colour edit works by a  number of white women? How many  times has this ever been done in our  white dominated society? How many  times have we seen works by women of  colour edited by white women?  We are currently at work on another  anthology of lesbians, bisexuals and gay  men of African descent. This will also be  a first for Sister Vision, publishing an  anthology which includes men.  Huang: A lot of people might think  publishing is a very glamorous business. Is that an accurate characterization? What are the realities of your work?  Martin: Glamorous? Hah. Realities?  What does that mean? Long hours, a  very unstable fiscal base, juggling debt,  little time for personal leisure. Certainly  not glamorous, far from it.  Silvera: Oh Stephanie, please, you're  scaring all those eager young women  who want a career in publishing, and we  need them because we're getting tired  (laughs).  Martin: OK, it's true, there are moments—the excitement of opening the  got to the sea  first box from the printer, smelling the  book as you turn the pages, and there is  the challenge and the sense of being an  important part of history.  Huang: Makeda?  Silvera: Ah, it depends on the day,  the hour, the month you talk to me. Let's  just say in publishing there is never a  dull moment. Unpredictability  reigns...days with not too many hours  and then some with too many. The phone  never stops. You are at the centre of  things. Working with writers, at times  speaking with them only through correspondence and long distance calls, never  meeting them until perhaps years  later...you know...so it becomes like a  long distance affair (laughs).  But seriously, I do agree with  Stephanie, there are other days when I  wonder, 'what the hell are you doing in  this crazy industry.' Days when I feel 'in  service,' constantly at the bidding of a  herd of people with not a creative bone  in my body, when I wish for that invisible place where I am taken care of,  where there is no fax, no computers, no  TV...maybe a portable phone (laughs).  Martin: Publishing is a roller coaster.  It's not unusual for us to put in 12-hour  days or work weekends and holidays.  You learn to roll and dodge the blows,  ride the highs. I think it has to be in your  blood in order to love it.  Huang: Would you say there are  more opportunities for women of colour writers in Canada to have their work  published by mainstream presses or al-  temative and feminist presses today than  Continued on next page Feature  Ten years of Sister Vision Press  Continued from previous page  there were when you started Sister Vision?  Martin: Yes. Sister Vision Press  paved the way for the presses who now  publish many women of colour. Ten  years ago, other publishers were not  interested in moving in such an uncharted direction, were not interested in  publishing voices, books, issues that  were to them, unfamiliar, were not interested in much other than the familiar  voice, be it French, Anglo or other European writers. This has changed dramatically—women of colour are being published by many other alternative and  feminist presses, and also by other publishers who are concerned primarily with  the bottom line and not issues.  Silvera: But we broke the ground  and planted the seed. Ironically, it is the  mainstream presses that benefit from  our radical, revolutionary, grassroots  work. Still, I am happy for any person of  colour who makes it to the big boys, if  that guarantees a larger readership, more  sales.  I wouldn't necessarily say that there  are a lot more opportunities for women  of colour writers in mainstream presses;  in small presses, particularly feminist  presses, yes. Mainstream presses' mandate is not to develop a body of work by  women of colour writers.  I think in some ways they continue  to perpetuate myths about who we  should read, and that only two or three  of us at any particular point in history  can succeed as writers,  Huang: There are a lot of things going on that probably adversely affect  your work—the backlash against  women, lesbians and gay people, people  of colour, against affirmative action; the  neo-conservative agenda pushing for  funding cuts to arts and cultural programs, and so on. What has all this  meant to you? How do you survive—  financially, emotionally, physically?  Martin: There is a backlash in some  ways, particularly with the recent cuts  made by our provincial government—  they take your breath away. These folks  are brutal, with apparently little understanding or caring for any type of  marginalized person—poor folk,  women, children, people with disabilities. Certainly, anything to do with  women of colour would not be a priority. It's grim.  Silvera: The fact is we find and continue to find other ways of surviving.  If s not just funding cuts that affect us  directly. Indirectly, it affects us because  people buy less. Our bookstore sales  have dropped, independent bookstores  are struggling, the rising cost of paper.  Martin: Also, a substantial number  of books get returned to us after being  bought within the industry, and this has  been up to almost 40 percent in some  cases.  Silvera: Many course books to universities are returned. Not that our books  are not relevant—because in fact they  are—but for some reason professors prefer to xerox pages for students rather  than buy the books. Obviously, cuts affect students too, and most times the  cost of books seems too high. Our struggle in this industry is continuous, as it is  for other feminist publishers and publications. It is not a good time.  Martin: So we have to figure out  strategies for survival that are not dependent on funding. This is hard in a  business that does not make profit. So  emotionally and physically, you roll with  it. We're pretty tough and quite resilient, and I guess even in these times, one  has to keep a sense of optimism and  humour.  Huang: Is there still a relevance or  need for a Black women and women of  colour press? Do you see Sister Vision  Press around for another 10 years?  Silvera: We started Sister Vision Press  with a vision, and that vision came out  of a politic—literary, grassroots, and  political. Books about us were not in  people's houses, on kitchen tables, in the  bookstores, in the classrooms, in the  review section of newspapers, at  bookfairs. We, with our vision, with  hard work and determination are part  of the continuum of publishers in our  communities keeping the voices alive.  There is absolutely no question that there  is a greater need today for us as a woman  nothing for me. Up until this year, I  designed most of the books and covers  for the press, which on one hand allowed me to bring images of women of  colour to print, which in itself was a  political act as that was not a concern of  many established presses. On the other  hand, production deadlines and my total focus on doing these books inhibited  my creative expression in my own painting.  I guess it is the price one pays when  one has such demanding passions in  life. Throw balance to the dogs! Our pets  often feel cross andneglected, and sometimes we live like bandits in our own  house. But it is fertile ground for great  stories, humour and love. And as I get  older, I am achieving the balance I long  for.  Silvera: The rewards have been plentiful. The books Sister Vision publishes  continue to be a steadfast commitment  to the literature and art of Black women  and women of colour. And yes to your  question, I have often felt guilty about  not spending enough time with my children; guilty about forgetting to do this  or that because of the long hours at  work.  ...there are moments—the excitement  of opening the first box from the printer,  smelling the book as you turn the pages,  and there is the challenge and the sense  of being an important part of history.  — Stephanie Martin —  of colour press to stay alive, as difficult  as it sometimes is.  Martin: Ten years is a long time for  a woman of colour press to be around  holding her own in this climate, but still  it is not enough time to see all the implications of the political and literary  changes that have occurred because a  press like this exists. We will continue to  do critical books.  Huang: Sister Vision has been a huge  part of both of your lives—personal,  political, and professional. Were there  ever times you wanted to quit, leave it  all behind and move on to other things?  Martin: Yes. There have been times  when I've been so exhausted mentally  and physically that I doubted my ability  to continue in a creative, committed  way. Some call it burn out, I suppose. At  times, I have felt a great sense of loss at  not pursuing my own personal creative  dreams.  I have always had difficulty in  achieving 'balance'—it's kind of all or  There have been days too when I  actually wanted to walk out and never  come back, when I wanted to leave all  the lives behind. But not for long. I love  what I do and that is why I do it.  In saying all of this, it has extracted  quite a fair cost from my personal life  and to some extent, my creative endeavours. After all, we did not begin the  press as two business people, but as two  artists, with our own personal and individual dreams. Many people who choose  to do something with their lives, do  something as individuals—they try to  be the best writer, the best singer, the  best accountant, the best whatever, and  that remains their primary focus.  When you choose to do something  with your life that is politically motivated and has the potential to affect a  generation, it obviously will be at a personal cost. But I love publishing, it is in  my blood.

Centime Zeleke  AFREKETE:  An Anthology of Black Lesbian Writing  Edited by Catherine E. McKinley and  L. Joyce DeLaney  Doubleday, New York, 1995  In the multiple declared and undeclared wars that have been waged globally in the past 500 years or so, very few  have seen Black people much less Black  lesbians as victors. Any effort toreinscribe  Black peoples experience back into the  history texts—be they oral or written—  must be viewed as remarkable. It is with  this sentiment that I came to the book,  Afrekete: An Anthology of Black Lesbian  Writing.  Afrekete is a slick book. The title, taken  from Audre Lorde's writings, is catchy  and recognizable since Lorde does sit at  the top of the lesbian pantheon. The name,  I feel, is also supposed to appeal to an  Afro-American nationalist sentiment.  However no kente cloths adorn this book;  rather, the cover is plastered with snapshots of Sears shoe boxes, shoes and the  suited back of a butchy looking woman—  that is, moments in the history of style.  Despite my cynicism, I like this book  cover because it destabilizes the notion  that Af ricanness or Blackness must translate into mango fruits, afros and kentes.  Blackness can be many things at many  times.  The slickness of the book's cover is  maintained by having big names like  Audre Lorde, Pat Parker, Michelle Cliff,  Linda Villarosa and Sapphire interspersed within its pages. But Afrekete is  decidedly not a survey look at Black  lesbian writings (we have not gotten that  far). The book, which consists of about 15  other writings by less known or first time  published writers, insists that these new  voices must co-exist with the more established, bigger names.  It is significant then that while most  anthologies try to emphasize commonness and sameness, the writing in Afrekete  insists that, 'yes we have commonalities  as Black lesbians, but other than that we  are extremely varied.' They write in many  different genres, from magic realism to  sci-fi. They also write academic essays,  poetry and personal narratives.  As a collection, Afrekete does not try  to make allusions to a happy Black lesbian family, but more simply states we  are bearing witness to our lives, to our  history—this is what it says.  As a result a reader will find the  story, essay or poem that will articulate a  multitude of experiences. If you were  looking for that piece to send to your  homophobic parents, your religous aunt,  or your best friend who could have been  your girlfriend if only you knew... you  will find it in Afrekete.  From the cover of Afrekete: An Anthology of Black Lesbian Writing.  However, I also approached the  book with trepidation. Why, I asked  myself, was Doubleday, a division of  Bantam Doubleday Publishing Group,  Inc. producing a book of Black lesbian  writings? Why were the editors  Catherine E. McKinley and L. Joyce  DeLaney approached with the idea of  producing the book, as opposed to them  proposing to do the book? And why, as  the promotion on the back cover on the  book suggests, was the book "destined  (which I read as "designed") to become  a classic in the tradition of the best  selling Black-eyed Susans/Midnight Birds  and Erotique Noire/Black Erotica."  Of course, the most burning question that one must ask themselves when  they read anthologies such as this one  is, 'how many of the writers have stacks  of novels or other works at home that  will never be published because  Doubleday has filled its quota of Black  lesbian writings or because it is not  commercially profitable to support an  individual single Black lesbian's writing on its own?'  This is the danger of anthologies  that mainstream the marginalized. On  the one hand, they allow for the recognition of writers, but on the other, they  do not develop the work of any one  particular writer. Perhaps then, these  anthologies can be reconceptualized as  a ghettoization process, giving some  women access to publishing with one  hand, but taking it away with the other.  While I have reservations about  how Afrekete may have come to exist  and even how it is packaged, the individual essays, stories and poems in the  book do not lend themselves easily to  the process of commodification. These  are passionate narratives that speak  from a place that has long been silenced  and continues to be silenced by all the  crazy making, neo-patriarchal, neo-rac-  ist, neo-isms that the late 20th century  affords us.  While it is possible to get your panties   wet   while   reading   through  Afrekete—particularly if one starts with  the Audre Lorde selection that describes  Black women in no short measure—  erotica is significantly lacking from the  books content. Conversely, I found myself either shaken, disturbed or crying  by the time I came to the end of each  piece.  The lack of explicitly sexual material is not surprising. Erotica or pornography is never considered good writing.  Writing full of pain and suffering usually is. Upholding the puritanical traditions of our fore-masters, the editors  used the anthology "to collect good writing- naratives that [they] would like to  read." (I could be simplifying the issue.)  Jackie Goldsby, who wrote probably the most brilliant essay of the book,  "Queen for 307 Days", problematizes  the issue of representing Black sexuality. Her essay takes the sex radicals and  the sex wars (Pat Calif ia versus Catharine  McKinnon) to task for all they said or  failed to say about Vanessa Williams'  downfall as Miss America because she '  posed as a lesbian.  Goldsby suggests that "the historical construction of Black sexuality is  always pornographic, if by pornographic  I mean the writing or technological representation and mass marketing of the  body as explicitly sexual." Later on,  Goldsby explains that "as long as Black  sexuality was a market commodity,  white voyeurism was an always present  threat...silence then affords a measure  of control; a strictly held confidentiality  amplifies the pleasure of self determination."  Afrekete is an American book.  "Dare," by Melanie Hope is a piece that  particularly captures the Americanism  that runs through the book. This piece  describes one woman's stuggle to reconcile herself to love her white girlfriend, without her family's approval.  While Hope rightly locates family as a  site where oppression is carried out, she  focuses too much on her own right to do  as she pleases and blames her family,  not for being homophobic, but for being  too backward to understand that white  people and Black people can now have  loving and equal relationships.  The author therefore casts herself as  being courageous and daring for battling her Guyanese parents' oppressive  xenophobia. What is really irritating  about the piece is that its analysis is  limited to looking at individual behaviour, as opposed to placing it within the  larger systemic and institutional context that informs individual behaviour.  Another typically American theme  that runs throughout the book is the  place of Africa. Too many of the pieces  cast Africa as a static place of earthiness  and authenticity. While there may be  obvious reasons that I can empathize  with for the constructing of Africa by  Afro-Americans in such a light, it still  remains disturbing. Africa and Africans  are after all a real place and real people.  So while I would encourage all my  Black lesbian sisters and even some  straight ones to check out Afrekete, I  would caution that the rules of the game  have changed. These days, we are allowed to have our own books, our own  magazines, our own heroes; heck these  days, we are even allowed to kill our  own.  If the 1995 Newt Gingrich/Lloyd  Axworthy Right-wing b(l)acklash is any  indication of the future, then the inclusion of Pat Parker's poem, "Where Will  You Be" seems nearly a self-reflexive  gesture on the part of the editors.  The poem sums up the importance  of Afrekete. Parker's poem comdemns  people for not speaking out against  homophobia, but also warns:  "they will not come  clothed in brown  and swastikas, or  bearing chest heavy with  gleaming crosses.  The time for ruses are over.  They will come in business suits to buy  your homes  and bring bodies to fill your jobs...  where will you be when they come  where will we all be when they come  and they will come."   E.

Effectively condensing three  lifetimes into the space of one book, Yan  Li's straightforward, compelling story  makes the leap between China and  Canada with refreshing candour and  grace.  While the clarity of Li's language  enables the reader to slip into the lives of  people from a different culture, Li's  strength is in her ability to put a human  face to the longtime struggle of Chinese  women for equality and justice, placing  personal histories into a wider societal  context.  Born to a mother who is labelled as  a Rightist in the 1957 Anti-Rightist Campaign, Peace knows firsthand what it is  like to be bullied and despised for matters which are beyond her personal control. Though she is continually hurt and  mistreated by people around her during  her childhood and youth, she has a steadfastness and quiet endurance which enables her to stand strong in the face of  shifting political campaigns and a system which attempts to dehumanize her.  Moreover, her tone is one which  strives for honesty and evenhanded-  ness. In one childhood incident, she is  attacked by her aunt who has read  Peace's diary detailing the ups and  downs of her life—the hunger, the beatings and the small joys of her time in a  northeastern rural area. Peace's reply to  the aunt's charge of ingratitude is that  she has only written the truth and that  she will write down everything—words  which only infuriate the aunt. This incident characterizes Peace's awareness of  her right to her own thoughts, an independence which must often be hidden in  dangerous political climates.  Peace comes from a line of strong  women. Her mother Qin, who is said to  be born with a man's fate but a woman's  body, has enough determination for ten  people. As a child, Qin stands up to the  men who try to bully her widowed  mother—using her ingenuity and courage, she is delightfully spirited in the  way she outsmarts both greedy male  relatives and the mayor of her city.  Although the young Qin embraces  socialism, with its "blueprint of a new  classless society, where the people were  to be the masters and no exploitation  and oppression would exist," she is ironically and unfairly labelled an enemy of  the people during a political campaign.  Tragically, Qin's intelligence and  strength are not enough to save her from  being scapegoated, and her life becomes  a series of frustrated attempts to regain  her reputation and face.  Though Qin has more opportunities  than her mother, she is nonetheless  trapped in a system which thwarts any  chances she has of realizing what she  considers to be her full potential. Still,  her determination in the face of harassment which drives countless others to  suicide is testimony to her achievements.  Under the old feudal system, Qin's  mother or Peace's grandmother, Laolao,  was expected only to be silent and submissive to her wealthy husband; contrary to this, she firmly made sure that  her daughters received the education  that she herself had so badly wanted.  Granted the class status of "enlightened  landlord," Laolao complements her  daughter Qin well; in times when one is  weak, the other is strong, and as a team  the two can be formidable indeed.  Left: detail from the cover of Daughters of the Red Land; and author Yan  Li at right. Photos courtesy of Sister Vision Press.  Although Peace hopes to find a better future in Canada after her painful  life in China, her current situation as a  housekeeper for a wealthy old woman  in Canada suggests that the new land is  not necessarily so wonderful either.  Other narratives by victims of the  Cultural Revolution, such as Jung  Chang's Wild Swans and Nien Cheng's  Life and Death in Shanghai, have also  posited the West as the place for a new  start after the terrors of the Cultural  Revolution. Yan Li's novel deepens this  theme by showing that the West carries  its own set of challenges and struggles  in economic and social arenas. By interspersing her Chinese stories with snippets of her Canadian life, Peace allows  readers to draw their own conclusions  about opportunities in the West.  On a broader level, Peace's stories  testify to the dream of a society without  oppression, telling us how difficult a  goal this is to actually achieve on a  personal level. What is amazing about  the narrator is that despite all the abuse  she encounters, some part of her still  knows the value of this journey, continuing to grow and to live each moment as fully as possible. The big issues  may not be so easily solved, but the  small day-to-day triumphs are to be  celebrated.  Yan Li will be launching Daughters of  the Red Land in a Canada-wide tour in  March. In Vancouver, she will be reading on  Friday, March 1 at 7:30pm at Women in  Print, 3556 W. 4th Avenue, and on Saturday, March 2 at 8:00pm at the Japanese  Canadian Citizens' Association building,  511 E.

HOURS:  V<SB 2N4 MONDAY - SATURDAY  TEL: (604) 684.0523 10 AM - 6 PM  KINESIS  FEBRUARY 1996 Arts  Review of the film Who's Counting?;  ABCs of  global economics  Shannon e. Ash  WHO'S COUNTING?:  MARILYN WARING ON SEX, LIES  AND GLOBAL ECONOMICS  Directed by Terre Nash  National Film Board of Canada, 1995  I'm glad that I'm reviewing this some  months after its Vancouver premiere (at  the Vancouver International Film Festival) because this is one of the few films  I've seen which I've liked better the second time around.  Who's Counting? is a simple introduction to the inequities and absurdities  of the global economic system, as  analyzed and critiqued by Marilyn  Waring, a New Zealand feminist economist and author of if Women Counted: A  New Feminist Economics.  Perhaps as an activist familiar with  many of the ideas brought forward in the  film, I was impatient, wanting more details, more complexities (not to say that  the film is simplistic), and more time  spent presenting alternatives to the current economic system. "We already know  this" and "preaclung to the converted"  are two comments that came to my mind,  and which I overheard someone saying  after the Film Fest screening.  Watching the film again, with someone who is not an activist, I was able to  appreciate fully both the teaching potential and visual beauty of the film.  Images of the natural world, particularly in the area of New Zealand I Aotearoa  where Waring lives, are central to the  film: the ocean waves and beach, dense  forests, the green farmland, grazing  sheep, and a shot of a tree with spiderwebs  shining with dewdrops in the morning  light.  The images are carefully matched to  Waring's analysis, which is largely presented through excerpts of a speech she  gave in Montreal.  Who's Counting? is divided into chapters to illustrate the various aspects of  Waring's work. It is a useful way of  presenting what could be very complex  topics.  The film begins with an introduction  of Waring's main concerns: making economics understandable to average people, and pointing out the flaws of national economic accounting. To illustrate  the flaws of the current system of measuring economic value, Waring explains  how it counts environmental disasters  like the Exxon Valdez (an oil tanker that  had a major spill off the coast of Alaska)  as increasing wealth generating income  by creating clean-up and legal activities,  et cetera, while ignoring the adverse impact of the spill on the environment.  Regarding globalization and "free  trade" agreements, Waring says that GDP  (Gross Domestic Product) may increase  but in reality this is unrelated to well-  Mucking up  the system  So what about those alternatives  Waring brings up at the end of her  Montreal lecture? Among hej  suggestions of ways to challenge the  current global economic system are:  ♦establishing quantitative  environmental indicators;  •time-use studies;  ♦pushing for parity in political parties  (half their candidates should be  women); and  •"mucking up the census"—making  your unpaid work count by using  creative answers.  (In Canada's next census—ttis  year—some of women's unpaid work  is to be counted.)  Marilyn Waring from Who's Counting? directed by Terre Nash.  Photo courtesy National Film Board of Canada.  being; but in fact, for many people, they  see things in their communities getting  worse.  The importance of having a community, a "place to stand" or  Turangawaewae in the Maori language,  is presented throughout the film. We  learn of Waring becoming the member  of parliament for her rural, conservative riding at the age of 22; her discovery of the economic accounting system,  which she terms "pathological" (there  is some wonderful, and at times amusing, early footage shown here); and her  research into women's uncounted work  using time studies.  "If you're not visible as a producer,  you're going to be invisible in the distribution of benefits," says Waring. For  example, she says, a woman who does  unpaid work all her life, with no pension plan, does not have her work  counted and is considered a burden  when she is old.  In the film, we leam of the United  Nations System of National Accounts  (UNSNA), based on a British, colonial,  wartime system, and which is now imposed on all UN-member nations. This  system recognizes "no value but money,  regardless of how that money is made."  The arms trade and the sex trade of  young girls and women in the Philippines and Thailand are two "productive" endeavours included in the  UNSNA. Women's worldwide production of food for household use is not  counted as having economic value.  The production and sustaining force  of ecosystems and natural processes,  are also unrecognized by the dominant  economic system. In the film, a local  New Zealand farmer, who opposed development of a gold mine, comments  on the importance of preserving the  means of human sustenance: "This goes  on forever...if we look after it."  Alternatives to the present system  of economic accounting, including traditional Maori economic values, are  briefly considered in the film [see box].  Biographical information about  Waring is presented only as it relates to  the development of her analysis and  demonstration of her thesis. At the Vancouver screening, one woman asked director Terre Nash why Waring's being  an out lesbian was not mentioned in the  film. Nash replied that both she and  Waring considered it irrelevant to the  film's topic. I would agree, since the  focus is on Waring's ideas about economics, but there is an argument for  increasing the visibility of lesbians.  I found the weakest part of Who's  Counting? to be the chapter on Waring's  decision to break from her governing  party to support a ban on US nuclear  warships coming into New Zealand's  harbour. Her decision led to the government to call an election.  This does illustrate Waring's commitment to principle in politics, something noted earlier by her constituents-  one Maori woman says, "We didn't have  to go to Marilyn. She came to us." But  although she had left politics at this  time, I was left wanting more information on what came of the election, especially considering the Right-wing economic regime that was imposed on New  Zealand shortly after, of which this film  makes no mention. (An interview with  Waring in the Montreal Gazette in June  1995, did raise this issue).  I noted with appreciation the music  of Penny Lang, who has appeared at the  Vancouver Folk Music Festival.  Who's Counting? is an excellent resource for those wanting an introduction to issues of global economics-for  classes, study groups, workshops, et cetera.  This is director Terre Nash's first  feature length documentary (at 90 minutes, the time goes amazingly fast). She  is best known for her 1982 documentary  If You Love This Planet [a documentary  on the work of anti-nuclear activist Helen  Caldicott], which won an Academy  Award.   Shannon e.

Thanks for the Beijing  conference coverage—great to have  the feel of being there.  Val Embree  The potential of the  Internet  Kinesis:  Thanks for your feature "Surfing or  Serfdom" which we found thought-  provoking [Kinesis, December/January  1996]. We are feminist activists and  publish Women'space, a Canadian  Internet Newsletter for Women. Our  enthusiasm for the Internet as a tool  for social change grows steadily with  our experience of networking with  women online.  Far from feeling isolated on the  'Net, we have found a supportive  network of women who are full of  energy and ideas for new ways to  develop this organizing tool. There are  technical challenges, which can be  frustrating, as well as attempts to  work out group processes. The  'sisterhood' mood online reminds us  of early days in the Women's  Liberation Movement—  encouragement, support networks,  sharing resources and volunteer  efforts to mentor women to learn new  skills. We are profoundly grateful to  our online sisters. We feel connected  to a feminist community which is yes,  overworked and underpaid, but  generates excitement, fun and hope.  Accessibility is a key issue. This  involves sharing resources, for  example, as women's groups and  women's centres take responsibility  for providing access points for  women, and encourage more women  to participate. The Internet is a  grassroots medium which gives equal  voice to a diversity of women. We  need to understand how this tool can  reach individual women and women's  groups who have not been, or felt,  included in many other women's  activities. Rural women, disabled  women, women tied to the care of  others, women of diverse cultures and  life situations can often find  appropriate resources and connections  for the first time~because of the  breadth, depth and diversity of the  global facilities on the Internet.  Have we really been working so  successfully that we don't need to  explore the political potential of this  new tool for greater inclusiveness and  effectiveness?

It is so good to see that 20  years later, Kinesis is still published  and now distributed across the  country and that VSW is still going  strong.  I remember well the camaraderie of  the Kinesis Editor Jo Lazenby, Gene  Errington (later NDP  Ombudswoman), Johanna den Hertog  (later national NDP president), Bobbi  (previously with CBC Radio and who  taught me everything about dealing  with the media) and Diana Bissell, et  al.

Our media action committee  persuaded Benson & Hedges to take  down all sexist ads on outdoor  billboards across Canada! We also had  a weekly Cable TV program "Woman  Alive". And there were men's  consciousness raising groups.  Yes, we have come a long way, but  there are always new issues coming  up and some old ones just never go  away.
