Poonam Randhawa, a high school  student in Vancouver, was celebrating her  18th birthday when she was shot in the  head and killed. Her body was then  dumped in an alleyway.  The man suspected of murdering her,  Ninderjit Singh (aka Soos), had been stalking Randhawa for almost two years. He has  not yet been picked up by police, as it appears he hopped on a plane to Los Angeles  shortly after Randhawa's murder.  Singh's stalking of Randhawa had  forced her to change schools to get away  from him. Her parents had even moved the  family and gotten an unlisted phone  number because they knew someone was  harassing their daughter.  Sadly though, most media accounts of  Randhawa's murder so far still focus on the  question: "How could such a smart, strong  young woman get into a car with a man  she had no interest in?" The classic, "Blame  the victim" scenario.  To counter the lack of understanding  of the realities of stalking and to raise  awareness about the difficulty many young  women face in reporting violence against  them, the Coalition of SouthAsian Women  Against Violence is taking it public. The  Coalition will be holding a rally on Sunday, February 21, from 2:00 to 4:00pm at  the Vancouver Art Gallery (Georgia St side.)  Kinesis encourages everyone to participate.  Also, as Kinesis goes to press... in the  ongoing funding saga of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women...  NAC executive members met with Status  of Women Canada officials on January 22  to discuss NAC's application for a multi-  year grant to examine the impact of the Liberal government's economic policies on the  lives of women. At the end of the meeting,  SWC agreed to fund the first phase of the  project, but said it would have to review  the other phases as they developed.  There's are several catches to the funding though... First: none of the funding is  retroactive, which means NAC will not  have received any federal funding support  for the work they've done over the past  year. This, of course, does not help NAC's  current financial situation which sees the  organization running a significant deficit.  That there leads to the second catch.  Since NAC has a deficit, SWC says it will  not give NAC the money as a grant, but  rather wants to set up a "contribution agreement," which will likely stipulate that NAC  cannot use any of the funds to pay down  the deficit.  And so, women's groups need to continue to lobbying federal politicians to support core funding for women's groups. Perhaps, it's a good time to do so since Finance  Minister Paul Martin is set to release the  Liberals' budget for the year.  We'll have more on that next month.  Until then, take care.

BORWf  Need a little intellechialN  stimulation?  Join the Kinesis  team as a proofreader;  CALL : 255-i  1999 started out as a rainy season outside and inside Kinesis. This month, we had  a difficult time getting Kinesis out in a timely  manner and in a content-full form. For that,  we apologize to our readers and advertisers. As you can tell, we've dropped down  to 16-pages this month, but that doesn't take  away from the excellent stories inside.  Our woes this month began when a  number of stories didn't gel, and culminated with burn-out, stress and ill health  setting in to almost everyone involved with  Kinesis. The Editorial Board had been planning a get together to talk about overwork  and burnout. Needless to say, that has been  put on hold until we work through our current malaise.  On a very happy note... this month, we  welcome a number of new volunteers on  the writing and production sides. Welcome  to Jennifer Johnstone who is making her debut as a writer. Jen, though, is not new to  Kinesis, having worked as the Administrator/Fundraiser for the Vancouver Status of  Women for five years between 1989 and  1995 (That makes her very familiar with  Kinesis.) Welcome and thanks also go to  Trena White who tested her hand at Movement Matters for the first time in this issue.  We acknowledge the contributions of  Sarah Amin from the World Alliance for  Breastfeeding Action, and Kay Hagan for  her comments on the dreaded Y2K. Kay's  piece was reprinted from our sister newspaper in the States off our backs, which we  are sad to report is having financial difficulties [see facing page.] We encourage  women to support oob any way you can to  keep the fires of feminist publishing alive.  In the production room, we welcome  new volunteer Tracey Palmer. Tracey tells  us she like to draw; we like that, too. We'll  definitely be encouraging her to come up  with her first visual contribution to Kinesis  for our next issue.  Also this production, we heap great  praises on Beatrice Fankhauser and Peggy  Lariviere. Both are doing their internships/  practicums with Kinesisâ€”Beatrice through  the International Language School (Beatrice  is from Zurich, Switzerland) and Peggy  through Burnaby College where she studied graphic designâ€”and both were critical  in the production and illustraion of this issue. (We also had the honour of enjoying  the vibrancy of Peggy's two young daughters, Fletchy and Trudy.)  Next month is another month, and we  plan to be back in full swing for our March  IWD issue. We're already working on a  grand centrespread idea, which we are sure  you'll like. Stay tuned.  Corrections  In Movement Matters [page 8] of our November 1998 issue, we incorrectly listed the  email address for Helen Dempster, who is contact person for the Fifth International Conference on Children Exposed to Family Violence which will be held in Vancouver in October.

The radical feminist monthly newspaper  published out of Washington, DC has put  out a desperate appeal for donations and  new subscriptions to save the paper.  Although the paper has always operated as a volunteer collective, recent problems, such as theft of their computer equipment and the bankruptcy of a company  which distributes the paper, have left oob  in serious financial difficulty The paper  was recently forced to lay off its one part-  time staff person.  off our backs has provided an important  arena for debating issues such as racism,  lesbianism, pornography and censorship,  women's studies, women's health, for more  than two decades. One of the core focal  points of the paper has always been working class and poor women's experience and  analysis.  oob's fundraising letter states: "If you  care about continuing the voice of independent feminist thinking, of radical feminist ideas, and of feminist debate and diversity; if you care about maintaining a  strong voice even in the face of worldwide  backlash, please do whatever you can to  help. Every contribution truly makes all the  difference."  The collective's most immediate concern is raising enough money to re-hire  their part-time staff person.  To help ensure oob stays alive and thrives,  supporters are asked to send donations or subscription requests to: off our backs, 2337B  18th St, NW, Washington, DC, 20009. (Subscriptions are US$28, or what you can afford.)  Towards Filipino  women's equality  Next month, a conference will be held  in Vancouver that will mark the first time  Filipino women have gathered together on  a national level in Canada to address a  broad range of issues from their perspective as grassroots Filipino women.  The first Filipino-Canadian Women's  National Consultative Forum is being  hosted by the Philippine Women Centre of  STITCHED  FABRIC BANNERS  MADE TO ORDER  Sima Elizabeth  Shefrin  [604] 734-9395  BC (PWC) and will take place from March  11 to 14 at the Heritage Hall and the St.  Andrews-Wesley United Church. The four-  day forum entitled, "Towards Filipino  Women's Equality" will showcase speakers, workshops, cultural presentations and  art exhibits. Also featured will be a special  engagement with keynote speaker  Ninotchka Rosea, an acclaimed writer and  advocate for Filipino women's issues.  The objectives of the forum are to develop an action plan towards achieving  equality for grassroots Filipino women in  Canada and to explore different strategies  for educating and organizing at the local,  national and international levels.  The main themes of the weekend will  be: labour and migration; human rights;  systemic racism and immigration; violence  against women; challenges for migrant  workers; and young women and their issues.  All forum participants, panel speakers,  facilitators and resource people will be Filipino women. Two additional events which  coincide with the forum will be open to the  public.  Filipina women interested in registering  or looking for more information are invited to  contact fane Ordinario at the Philippine  Women Centre, 451 Powell St, Vancouver, BC,  V6A 1G7; tel/fax: (604) 215-1103; email:  pwc@netcom.ca. The cost of attending the forum is $100, and the deadline for registration  is February 15.  GLBT Muslim group  started up  It was indeed a historic occasion as  more than 30 gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgender (GLBT) Muslims and non-  Muslims came together in Boston, Massachusetts last October.  The participants at the First International Retreat for GLBT Muslims represented the cultural and religious diversity  of the entire Islamic world, coming from  all over the United States and abroad.  Countries that were represented included  Belgium, Canada, Egypt, India, Germany,  Holland, Lebanon, Maldives, Saudi Arabia,  Syria, South Africa and Pakistan.  The retreat served as a forum for the  discussion of issues important to GLBT  Muslims. Workshops and sessions addressed such topics as faith and sexuality,  the oppression of GLBT persons in the Islamic world, GLBT identity in Islam, and  the historical perspectives of GLBT  behavior in Islamic societies. Additionally,  participants examined the opinions of the  Prophet Muhammad on sexual minorities  in his time, as well as the different interpretations of Quranic verses which appear  to address homosexual acts.  The highlight of the retreat was the  decision to establish an international organization to address the concerns of GLBT  Muslims around the world. Named after  the first chapter of the Quran,"Al-Fatiha"  (The Opening), the group will work together with other organizations, gay and  straight, Muslim and non-Muslim, to address the social and political issues facing  GLBT Muslims around the world.  Based in the US, Al-Fatiha will establish chapters to support GLBT and questioning Muslims on a local level. It will also  work with human rights organizations to  advocate against abuses of GLBT persons  in Islamic countries.  Organizers of the retreat say the event  was something that has been needed in  their community for decades. "The retreat  has given us the opportunity to come together as a community in a way that was  never possible before," said Faisal Alam,  coordinator of the retreat. "Much of the  prejudice and discrimination against gay,  lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in  Islamic societies is culture-based and does  not stem from Islam as a religion. We want  to celebrate our identity as GLBT people  who are also believing Muslims."  The Second International Retreat for  GLBT Muslims is tentatively scheduled to  take place in June 2000 in Capetown, South  Africa. Meanwhile, plans are already  underway to organize another meeting in  the US, tenatively planned for New York  City this coming April.  The First International Retreat was sponsored by the Gay-Muslims Listserv, an  internet-based, email discussion group whose  purpose is to bring together GLBT and questioning Muslims in a forum to communicate  issues of common concern.

Valentine's Day  memorial march  The 8th annual February 14th memorial march against violence against women  in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is coming up again soon, and the organizers are  calling for support. The Valentine's Day  march is held to commemorate the women  from the Downtown Eastside who die each  year due to violence.  While the event is organized by  women in the community, everyone is invited to make a clear and public statement  against violence against women.  Supporters are asked to help in the following ways: 1) Place purple ribbons in  your windows, or in some other prominent  place, with a clear statement of you or your  organization's commitment to fighting violence against women wherever, whenever,  however it occurs. 2) Discuss the issue of  violence against women with your staff,  clients, friends, and anyone else. 3) Bring  as many supporters as possible to the  march. 4) Make a donation, either financial  or through providing gifts like blankets,  arts and crafts, beaded items or medicine  bags.  The Valentine's March starts at 12:00  pm at the Carnegie Community Centre at  Main and Hastings. Native Elders will lead  the walk, stopping at locations where  women have died. Prayers will be held at  Oppenheimer Park, and will be followed  by food, drumming and dancing at the  Japanese Language Hall [see Bulletin Board  page 15 for full details.]  For more info, call Mariene Trick at the  Doivntown Eastside Women's Centre at (604)  681-4786 or the Breaking the Silence Against  Violence Against Women Project at (604) 682-  3269, ext. 8319.  Custody and access  coalition lobbies on  by Sheryl Burns   The Ad Hoc Coalition on Custody and  Access based in Vancouver is continuing  its lobbying efforts following the release of  the Joint Senate/House Committee on Custody and Access' report, "For the Sake of  Children," last December.  The Coalition was instrumental in setting up a national online network of women  and women's groups active on custody and  access issues called the Women's Justice  Network. WJN launched a targetted fax  campaign in November criticizing the Joint  Committee's process and the inappropriate behaviour of several of its key members [see Kinesis December-/January 1999.]  The Committee's report reflects the  views of all the Liberal and Conservative  members of parliament and senators sitting  on the Committee. Three sets of dissenting  opinions were submitted by the Reform,  Bloc Quebecois and NDP members of the  Committee.  "For the Sake of Children" is philosophically situated within the family-focused belief that "shared parenting" and  maximum contact between children, their  parents and family members after divorce  is advantageous. Mandatory participation  in programs designed to educate parents  about the impact of divorce on their children is recommended.  Violence within families is largely ignored. One recommendation is that "the  unilateral removal of a child from the family home be recognized as contrary to the  best interests of the child, except in a emergency." The Committee also suggests that  a parent who has removed a child from the  family home should not be allowed to use  the "resulting period of sole care and control of the child, of whatever duration, as  the basis for a sole parenting order." Such  recommendations, if passed, may effectively prevent women and their children  from fleeing to transition houses when in  need of safety.  The Committee's report is based on the  premise that reality has shifted so that  women now wield inordinate amounts of  power under the Divorce Act and in the  court system, leaving men cowering under  the weight of such "inequality" In an attempt to addresss the "inequalities" experienced by men, the Committee requests  that the Minister of Justice undertake a  "comprehensive review of the [Child Support] Guidelines to reflect gender equality  and the child's entitlement to financial support from both parents..." Furthermore, the  Committee focuses considerable energy on  what it calls the "pervasive problem" of  child abduction and false allegations of  abuse.  As part of its current strategy, the Ad  Hoc Coalition is focusing attention on influencing members of federal and provincial committees charged with the reviewing the Joint Committee's recommendations. The Federal/Provincial/Territorial  (F/T/P) Family Law Committee has been  given that mandate, as has a provincial  Subcommittee on Family Law Issues in  British Columbia.  The Ad Hoc Coalition is also urging  those concerned with the recommendations  of the Committee to write to members of  the opposition parties to express their views  and ask them to raise those concerns in the  House of Commons.  BC is represented on the F/P/T Family  Law Committee by Robin Bassett, Senior Solicitor of the BC Legal Services Branch, Ministry of the Attorney General, Sussex Building, 1001 Douglas St, Victoria, BC, V8V1X4;  tel: (250) 356-8416; fax: (2500 356-8992;  email: robin.bassett@ag.gov.be.ca.

FEBRUARY 1999  KINESIS Write out  ^-u^^rrih^j^in^ir^tM^t^FJ-^  Since March 23, 1998, the women of UNITE Local 1764 have been on  strike in a labour dispute with JB Fields. The women have been treated in  an unfair and sexist manner by their employer. At the moment there are 38  members (scabs) inside working and only 22 receiving strike pay. Of these  22, 19 are working elsewhere, so the line is extremely thin. The company  has not made an attempt to get back to the bargaining table since August's  vote and workers inside are looking at making application to start a company union.  UNITE has been in discussion with Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) over  their sourceing policy and sale of JB Fields products. MEC has agreed to:  not sell JB Fields products in the Vancouver main store, not purchase  additional stock from other stores until the labour dispute is resolved and  to post a flyer in all stores stating that there is a labour dispute between  JB Fields and UNITE Local 1764. However, MEC is still carrying a current  stock of JB Fields socks on its shelves.  The following petition calls on Mountain Equipment Co-op to stop selling JB Fields socks and to recognize the struggle by the women of Unite  1764 for equality and justice. Please sign and forward to those who will  be interested, especially members of MEC. If you are the 25th, 50th,  100th, etc person to sign the petition please forward it to bmatheson@mec.ca  and copy it to Friends of UNITE 1764 at woodharry@hotmail.com For more  info about the progress of this strike check: www.angelfire.com/on/unitel 764.  The Honourable Elizabeth Witmer  Minister of Health  Hepburn Block, 10th Floor  Toronto, Ontario  M7A 2C4  Dear Ms.Witmer,  I am writing to protest your government's change in funding levels to  midwifery practices in this province. The change in funding for midwifery threatens the model of care and may result in decreased access to  midwifery care and in job losses in existing midwifery practices. This  occurs just when this new profession is trying to  increase access by expanding services across the province. I request that  midwifery funding be set at a level which ensures that women in this  province have access to the care that we choose.  Secondly, I protest the lack of action by your government to ensure  access to specialist back-up for midwifery clients across the province.  This situation is dangerous as women and babies are put at risk because  of the government's inability to create a way for specialists to be paid for  a midwifery consult. This discriminates against women who choose  midwifery care and shows a lack of respect for the midwifery profession.  Midwifery clients have a right to the same health care services as those  women who choose to give birth supported by other professions.  The Ontario midwifery model of care is important to me. Please take  action to rectify these problems.  Sincerely,  Name  Address (address or at least city/town is important)  2^~-TM,j.,:r:::;ii  ^Z Whereas Mountain F"  â€¢  'Priority ml   hl   . Â«PO,,C>'ra*ngasfoUovvs  Midwives in Ontario seek support  &b  Starting in early January, 1999 midwifery practices in Ontario began to  receive their funding differently than  they have in the past It has been  determined that some practices will no  longer be financially viable. Others will  run out of money in early 1999. This is  basically the same as going bankrupt  The government has a responsibility to  the women of Ontario to fund midwifery in the amounts necessary to  support the model of care. This same  government has neglected to take  actions to ensure that midwifery clients  receive specialist care under situations  when it is required. No mechanism  currently exists for these specialists to  be paid for consultations for midwifery  clients, and thus in some areas of the  province specialists have refused to see  women who are midwifery clients. This  is not only a dangerous situation, with  potential life threatening outcomes, but  it also discriminates against women  who choose midwifery and shows a  lack of respect for the midwifery  profession.  The government must take action to  ensure midwifery clients receive the  care they are entitled to. The Ontario  Midwifery Consumer Network is asking  you to fax a letter of protest to Elizabeth Witmer, Minister of Health (fax#  1 -41 6-326-1571) and to your local  MPP expressing your concern. A short  sample letter is provided.

That  is money that could be spent on health and education. The United Nations estimates  that debt relief could save the lives of 7 million children every year. Tell the world's  most powerful leaders to cancel the unpayable debt of the world's poorest countries  by the year 2000. Your signature will be handed in at the G8 Summit of the most  powerful nations in Cologne, Germany in June 1999.  Sign the petition now and make the millennium a celebration for everyone.  Jubilee 2000 needs to collect 22 million signatures for the world's largest petition. For  more information on the international movement Jubilee 2000, visit the website:  http://www.jubilee2000uk.org.  We, the undersigned, believe that the start of the new millennium should  be a time to give hope to the impoverished people of the world.  1 o make a fresh start, we believe it right to put behind us the mistakes  Imade by both lenders and borrowers, and to cancel the backlog of unpayable debts of the most impoverished nations.  We call upon the leaders of lending nations to write off these debts by the  year 2000. We ask them to take effective steps to prevent such high levels of  debt building up again.  We look for a new begirtning to celebrate the millennium.  City  Country  Signature  KINESIS  FEBRUARY 1999 Feature  Strengthening women's groups in Canada:  Feminist fundraising is  movement building  by Jennifer Johnstone  r  For the past two years, I have been  meeting with a group of feminist  fundraisers in Vancouver to develop a  shared understanding of the future of resource development for women's groups  and opportunities for collaborative  fundraising. In other words, we are trying  to redefine philanthropy.  All of us have  been feeling the  pressure from cutbacks in government funding, as  well as increased  competition  among non-profits  generally for com-  m u n i t y  fundraising dollars. We are all angered by the recent  changes to federal  Women's Program  funding criteria  that eliminated  any core support  for women's  groups in favour  of more project  funding [Kinesis I  June 1998.]  We have witnessed the alarming disappearance  of women's groups in Vancouver in the past  few years, including the last women's print  shop in North America, Press Gang Printers, and our Women's Bookstore. We are  also acutely aware of the fragile existence  of many groups that face the increasing  pressures of co-optation and  mains beaming.  'â– â– ': J  Women's groups are  well aware that our  goals and objectives  for a given project  may conflict with  corporate goals to  improve their  bottom line or image  We wanted to find ways to strengthen  women's organizations and help us move  away from our reliance on shoe-string  budgets and towards financial  sustainability and the institutionalization  of feminist structures and values.  As feminist fundraisers, we reject  many of the accepted explanations for the continued struggle  for survival of  women's groups.  Progressive women's organizations, particularly  those that employ  alternative models to the standard  corporate hierarchy of most  non-profits, have  faced an increasingly critical envi-  ronment. For  many years, we  have been told  that our way of  doing things is  not legitimate or  accountable, and  won't work.  In 1998, we  were faced with  the Panel on Accountability and Governance in the Voluntary Sector (PAGVS) which issued a discussion paper proposing, among other things,  the exclusion of alternative organizational  models to the acceptable standards for  non-profit and charitable organizations  [Kinesis July/August 1998.] After a series of  consultations last Fall, the Panel is set to  issue its final report in February. (For a copy,  visit its website at http://www.  pagvs.com.)  More often than not, we are accused  of being unprofessional or naive in our idealism and desire to incorporate our complex understanding of issues of equity into  the leadership and day-to-day management of our organizations. It is interesting  that, even when the innovations of women's organizing are becoming more acceptable in the corporate worldâ€”witness the  "flattening of hierarchies" team-building  approach of many corporations during the  1980sâ€”credit is not given to us.  Many women's groups have been told  that if we only changed our organizations  to better "fit" the models of mainstream  charitiesâ€”with their elected, arms-length  Boards of Directors, hierarchical staff structures and fundraising based on attracting  the wealthy and powerful to our organizationsâ€”then we would have no trouble surviving. However, we are well aware that  this mainstream notion of "survival" would  come at the expense of our feminist principles and practices.  These public misconceptions about the  roles and effectiveness of women's organizations pose ongoing challenges for women's groups. They ignore the underlying  fundamental purpose of feminist organizations: social change and social justice. For  many of us, the way that we do thingsâ€”  the meansâ€”are as important to achieving  the appropriate ends as the ends themselves.  Women's groups continue to meet the  needs of a wide range of women even  though we have fewer resources and are  facing a strong anti-feminist backlash that  shows no signs of weakening.

Unlike other large and established  non-profit and charitable organizations, we  have not had the resources to ensure sufficiently trained and supported staff, suitable  office locations, decent equipment, and  strong volunteer programsâ€”all needed to  run our organizations.  It is the goal of organizational strengthening that brought us together as feminist  fundraisers. Our experience as fundraisers  has taught us that many of the traditional  methods and means of raising money are  not particularly useful to women's groups  and require significant modification. The  emphasis on "who you know" that permeates much of mainstream fundraising does  not easily translate to social justice  fundraising.  Our success is dependent much more  on our ability to articulate our cause and  reach a sympathetic audience. We also must  ensure that our fundraising encompasses  our feminist values at that same time that  we meet our resource needs.  For example, corporate fundraising  poses a number of different questions for  women's groups. For many, raising funds  from corporate donors requires the development of a feminist definition of "ethical"  business which goes beyond just environmental friendliness to women friendliness.  Some of the issues considered by women's  groups have included questioning the nature of the product or service of a business,  as well as its employment practices to ensure neither exploit or harm women, per-  see FUNDRAISING page 10  Paula Clancy, b.a.

Amin is the  director of the World Alliance for Breastfeeding  Action (WABA), a global network with over  300 groups and individuals in over 80 countries, based in Penang, Malaysia.  Formed in 1991, WABA's goals are to reestablish and maintain a global breastfeeding  culture; to eliminate all obstacles to  breastfeeding; to promote more regional and national level cooperation; and to advocate for  breastfeeding in development, women, environmental and human rights programs.  Sunera Thobani had the opportunity to  talk to Amin about breastfeeding activism while  they were both in Kuala Lumpur. (In the December/January issue of Kinesis, Thobani wrote  about the Women's Conference and the accompanying People's Assembly.) She teaches in the  Women's Studies Department at Simon Fraser  University in Burnaby, British Columbia.  Sunera Thobani: The connections you  make between breastfeeding and globalization are very interesting because I've  never thought about them in quite those  terms. It made me aware of how much the  women's movement, particularly in  Canada, has side-lined the whole issue of  breastfeeding. Why do you feel  breastfeeding is so important for women  and what impact do you think globalization is having on women's breastfeeding?  Sarah Amin: For the longest time,  breastfeeding was talked about as a child's  health issue and largely from a nutritional  point of view. It wasn't until the 1990s that  breastfeeding began to be recognized as  woman's rights and reproductive rights issues. This was due to a large extent to the  increased participation of breastfeeding  groups in major United Nations conferences, such as the International Conference  on Population and Development (in Cairo,  Egypt in 1995) and the 4th World Conference on Women (in Beijing, China in 1995.)  Through participation at various conferences and through ongoing dialogue  with women's groups around the world,  we tried to see how relevant language could  be put into UN covenants and other international documents so that groups supportive of breastfeeding could use these instruments to further their advocacy. We  were quite pleased to see that, at least at  the ICPD and the Beijing conference, and  more recently at the World Food Summit,  there were clear statements made in support of breastfeeding as a women's right  and as a child's health rights issue.  We are re-shaping, refining the way we  think about the issue. When WABA  launched the Mother Friendly Workplace  Initiative in 1993, we began to realize that  it is not enough just to support women being able to breastfeed during work hours.  Other support mechanisms also needed to  be put into place.  We also began to recognize that unless  we link strongly with other groups, the  breastfeeding issue will stay mainly within  the domain of breastfeeding groups. The  breastfeeding movement on its own has  been quite strong and systematic since the  late 1970s, but we needed to venture beyond framing the issue as related only to  health and nutrition if we wanted to build  a global campaign.  The best way to do this is to enlarge  the discussions and to build in the discourse of women's rights issues. We are  interested in linkages with the environmental movement and the alternative economics and development movement, but for  now, we are focusing on the women's  movement.  Thobani: Can you talk about the link  between breastfeeding and globalization?  Amin: I would say the broadest and  most systematic attack on breastfeeding  culture has come from the aggressive marketing of baby foods and infant formula.  This has created a bottle-feeding culture  which sells women the notion of "convenience." When the marketing push first  started up it is quite powerful because, at  that time, the women's movement was also  looking at avenues to liberate women from  the home. The bottle was seen as a liberating tool, allowing women to leave their  homes and put the responsibility of child  care to someone else. The formula companies profit off this notion of convenience by  saying that fathers, grandmothers, anyone  ,can participate in child care if you give  them a bottle.  With the commercialization of infant  feeding came the medicalization of women's ability to nurture and feed their children. This has led to an erosion of traditional knowledgeâ€”the knowledge of our  grandmothers' and our great grandmothers' is not being recognized anymore. In  fact, women are being de-skilled and  disempowered from a natural art.  Breastfeeding is something so natural for  women to do, but now, more and more  women are reliant on industry to provide  the food products and on the medical profession to provide the feeding expertise.  Thobani: Does WABA do support work  with individual women along with advocacy and lobbying?  Amin: Yes, many of the national groups  associated with WABA are actually support  groups, and so they work directly with  mothers in the community. There has been  criticism that many breastfeeding groups,  particularly in the United States, focus on  middle-class women who have the time to  participate. However, through their involvement with WABA, this has been  changing. Many groups are starting to develop peer support programs for women.  They are acknowledging that other mothersâ€”working mothers, poor mothersâ€”also  need support.  At another level, we are trying to advocate for direct support in the workplace  itself. There are several cases, where WABA  has started a partnership between breastfeeding groups and employers. In the Philippines, for example, there are a few factories with mostly women employees where  we've convinced employers to provide  space and facilities for women to  breastfeed.  The breastfeeding organizations in the  region provider trained support worker.  Women first go to an information session  to help them decide if it is a program in  which they want to participate. That way,  they understand what they are getting involved in. It also strengthens their commitment to sustain the program. Eventually, it  becomes their program; it does not continue  as something the employers provide because they feel it will keep women working in their factories longer.  In the long run, WABA is trying to  show there are real economic benefits to  employers. At this point, we have some  concrete data showing that women who  feel their employers are concerned with  their needs are, in fact, more loyal workers  and have higher productivity levels. They  don't have to worry as much that their baby  is sick at home because, generally, breastfed  babies are much healthier.  Thobani: In your presentation, you  talked about breastfeeding as a kind of resistance to globalization. Could you talk  about how you came to that position and  how you would set about convincing  women that this is indeed a strategy to resist globalization?  FEBRUARY 1999 Feature  <sO>".s \V\B\  Amm: It is very clear because  breastfeeding is something directly within  the control of women. Globalization is  about the penetration of big transnational  companies into women's livesâ€”controlling  the kind of food they eat, controlling the  way they feed their children and families.  Breastfeeding is a simple form of resistanceâ€”it is within the reach of women to  say no to instant formula, no to commercial products. By saying no, we are saying  we can sustain ourselves and our families.  It's a very direct means of resisting globalization and participating in food security.  This year, we have also taken concrete  steps to measure to economic value of  breast milk, in terms of its contribution to  the GNP (Gross National Product,) a measure of a nation's wealth. In some countries,  like Norway, they have actually estimated  a value for breast milk which shows it increases the GNP by quite a substantial percentage. This gives a good reflection that  women directly contribute to the national  economy, to food production. And this is  real production versus the invisible money  economy.  Thobani: When I first started to think  about breastfeeding in political terms, it's  hard to believe that millions of women  across the world have been convinced to  give up breastfeeding. Breast milk is a form  of nutrition that could save millions of children's lives across the world, and is something women naturally produce. Infant formula is much inferior and can lead to health  complications, and then there's the whole  issue of whether you can get safe water to  mix the formula or not.  I just get outraged every time I think  about it. How could it be possible to convince so many women to do something that  is detrimental to their children. It is part of  the whole process of losing knowledge  about our own bodies and about  medicalizing childbirth and childrearing.  Given this, what do you think is the potential for breastfeeding to become much more  wide-spread?  Amin: I think we have to target the  sources of misinformation. One source of  misinformation is the formula industry.  They put a lot of money into advertising  and flashy brochures which penetrate every  level of a mother's conscious. Women are  constantly bombarded with formula ads,  whether they're at the doctor's, watching  TV, reading the newspaper, and so on.  Another source of misinformation are  hospitals. Increasingly more births are taking place in hospitals, so that's where  women are getting information on  breastfeeding and child care. I talked about  our baby friendly hospital initiative at the  [APEC Women's Conference] Health Workshop because until you change hospital  practices in a way that totally supports  breastfeeding, then you can't help women  make the right decisions from the start.  A lot of women these days do not even  think about their pregnancy or how they  are going to feed their children until they're  already pregnant or in the hospital about  to give birth. We find that many women  only decide about whether or not to breastfeed when they are in the hospital and after their mothers or mother-in-laws have  already prepared them bottles with formula. Education has to begin much earlier,  but breastfeeding organizations have such  limited funds that it's hard to provide alternative information, or correct, information to women.  Another area we are focusing on is support mechanisms instituted by governments. Are they implementing maternity  leave? Are they ensuring that public places  are friendly to women and children? We  have been strongly advocating for shopping malls and public institutions to have  breastfeeding rooms. We are starting to see  such facilities coming up, but it is still going to take a long time.  In Malaysia, for example, during the  World Breastfeeding Launch last August,  three baby rooms were announced by the  city council of Kuala Lumpur. They started  them as a model for other cities to follow  suit and to encourage major shopping centres to start up breastfeeding rooms for  mothers. If you are a bottle feeding mother,  you can do it anywhere. If you are a  breastfeeding mother then you're more restricted.  We hope that by staging public information and awareness campaigns and by  giving employers and governments concrete ideas for what they can do, it will kick  off quite a few new and creative initiatives.  WABA just gave its first mother-  friendly workplace award to a pediatric institute and general hospital in Kuala  Lumpur. There, they recognize it is not  enough to be baby-friendly only for the  mothers who come in, they also need to be  mother-friendly to their staff. We strongly  advocate that if hospitals want to encourage new mothers to breastfeed, then the  nursing staff themselves must see they are  supported tooâ€”that they themselves are  able to breast-feed their own children.  Thobani: In Canada, there has been a  strong force in the women's movement to  de-medicalize birthâ€”to have birth taken  out from hospitals and to legalize midwifery, to increase the number of midwives  and have more midwives be part of the  publicly funded medical system. What  kind of links does WABA have with the  midwifery movement, and what possibilities of working together do you see?  Amin: Some of the midwives groups  in Australia and the United Kingdom are  already part of the WABA network. I am  not aware of any organized midwifery  groups inAsia. In Malaysia, midwives have  to go through a government program so  they become part of the government health  care system and are not independent practitioners. They fall under a more  medicalized model.  There tends to be a stronger awareness  about going back to natural birthing. The  midwives of Sweden are definitely doing  thatâ€”they work hand in hand with the  breastfeeding groups and vice-versa. In fact  we are starting now to advocate for natu  ral birthing, as well, in support of the midwifery issues. So I see a lot of linking taking place that way  Thobani: There is just one thing that  makes me a bit uncomfortable, and that is  making an economic argument around  breastfeeding. On one level, I can understand that we need to convince governments that breastfeeding makes a contribution to the GNP, but I think that the danger  is we can play into the values of a capitalist system.  Amin: We are very aware of not placing the issue totally within an economic  framework. But because there are real benefits to be gained, let us not forget that it is  a dimension to consider, still of course, always remembering it is a human rights issue.  Whenever we talk about the economics, we also talk about the other benefits.  That is why I started talking about the nutritional benefits, the health benefits, before  getting to the economic part.  I think if I were to make some kind of  an overview statement, I would say that  supporting breastfeeding also means ensuring conditions that promote gender equality and that improves women's status in  society. Everything we are calling for in a  society that enables breastfeeding would  also recognize women's reproductive work,  and value that work. We call for more  equality in the way that food is distributed  in families, and assurances that women are  fed properly. Before women can feed their  own children, they need to be well-fed.

Weighing in on  Y2K  Â§Â°9iaJ ?!>aosso8ral trans.   ,  formation 7  by Kay Hagan  As a kid in the fifties, I spent a lot of  time contemplating potential catastropheâ€”  specifically, the consequences of radiation  from a nuclear bomb (if I survived, of  course). I was especially fascinated with  what was called "fall out," the radioactive  dust that drifts over the landscape, spreading poison that, though unable to be perceived by the senses, soon causes illness  and death that reportedly involves lots of  vomiting.  At eight years old, I designed a fallout shelter fashioned from our basement  family room. In case of nuclear attack, I  understood we should live in such a shelter for two weeks, until the fall-out fellâ€”or  something like that. My folks were never  quite as concerned as I, and didn't outfit  the family room with canned goods and  candles. After all my pre-adolescent brooding, in the end I was never too sure what  might really happen, but I wanted to be prepared.  The current lather over Y2K (also  known as the Millennium "Bug" or  "Bomb") has brought these memories  flooding back to me, and I feel a similar  radical ambivalence about the prospect of  catastrophe. Now that I've gotten the word,  I want to know as much as possible in order to prepare. On the other hand, I resent  like hell having to frame my future in fear.  Michael Hyatt, author of The Millennium  Bug, has observed that my generation, having never known invasion, economic depression, or world war, lives in a "myth of  continuity"â€”and that the Year 2000 aftermath will be our big challenge. Aging  boomers coping with an unreliable infrastructure? Not a pretty picture. Tell me it  ain't so.  Since starting to pay attention to this  scene in early July [1998,] my emotions  have lurched from panic to denial and back  again dozens of times. Finding a middle  ground of awareness and preparation,  while at the same time maintaining daily  sanity, seems elusive. Knowing I risk being  perceived as a complete wacko, I try to remain calm when dropping Y2K into every  conversation, fishing for allies-in-aware-  ness or opportunities to educate the uninitiated. All the while, I am searching desperately for evidence proving it's all a mis  take, a hype, your typical millennial loss of  faith - but this isn't about  an etheric belief system  gone south: it's just poor  judgement catching up  with humanity, big-time.  I want to be assured the  fragile yet impressive  computer network spanning the globe is not going to collapse in a matter of a few hundred  days, crashing electrical  power grids and throwing the world into chaos.  I'm waiting for the word  to whip through the Net  that the whole Y2K shebang is a naughty prank  played by a bored Bill  Gates. Having already  pushed the envelope beyond the pale on arrogance and greed, he's exploring manipulation through mind control. "Start Me Up"  was only foreplay: Could Y2K be a wicked  marketing strategy for "Windows 00"?  By the time you read this, maybe Y2K  will be as prominent on the airwaves as  Clinton's sex life but somehow I doubt it. Although I've found plenty of nerve-wracking  Y2K information available on the Internetâ€”  including a veritable horde of congressional  testimony from worried Suits of all persuasions- there seems to be no uptake from centralized media sources. That is, while  Newsweek ran a cover story last year and the  New York Times made its Y2K concerns the  lead editorial on a Sunday in August, the  concerted media efforts that can focus massive public concern on an issue in a matter  of days, if not hours, has not occurred. I'm  told this may have to do with fear of massive litigation, when citizen/consumers begin to hold certain parties accountable. This  makes sense, but gee,  are our priorities a little twisted here? Like  fall-out, perhaps Y2K  will call attention to itself only through its  aftermath.  Regardless of the  source or spinâ€”from  DC suits to Christian  survivalistsâ€”one of  the recurring observations about Y2K is  that "no one can predict what will actually  happen." Despite this,  I've found various  analysts and consultants using the popular technique of "scenario planning" to  formulate a range of  possible outcomes.  With this method, you evaluate known facts  and assumptions about a situation, then  project logical consequences on a continuum  of effects - best case, worst case, and others  tailored to the likelihood of various circumstances. To help construct an overview of  Y2K in all its weirdness, I'd like to summarize two of the most popular perspectives  K^ould Y2K  be a wicked  I   marketing  I strategy for"  1 Windows 00"?  'm waiting for  the word to whip  through the Net  that the whole  Y2K shebang is a  naughty prank  played by a bored  Bill Gates.  that I've found at this point (September  1998)â€”and then add my own possible  scenarios to the mix, just for balance.  Apparently, many  of the most pessimistic  analysts are computer  programmers. This  disturbs me. These  folks would understand the most about  how computers work  (or don't). Ed Yourdon,  a veteran software engineer and author of  dozens of computer  books, is a prominent  spokesperson on Y2K,  having written Time  Bomb 2000 in late 1997,  with his daughter Jennifer, an investment  consultant. Generally, they expect significant consequences in daily life, and construct their observations in terms of "minor, moderate, serious, and devastating  failures" in areas such as jobs, food, utilities, transportation, and finance. They provide "fall-back advice" in scenarios of disruptions that last two days, one month,  one year, and ten years.  For example, they project that if the  electricity goes out for a month, it could  be due to errors in the billing system (the  computer thinks you haven't paid since  1900), or to malfunctions in power generation or delivery in the regional system,  or a combination of both. In the first case,  you'll be able to correct the problem  through one-to-one contact with a human  being along with paper documentation of  your recent statements. In the second case,  you'd better be stocked up with candles,  kerosene, and a few good booksâ€”and  prepared to wait it out with the rest of  your neighbors.  Throughout, the Yourdons describe  impending and certain societal chaos  with a calm and  even tone, focusing  on what individuals can do to prepare their personal  affairs and to take  care of their family's safety and  health. Their scenarios illustrate  many details of the  invisible  interconnectedness  underpinning the  Y2K threat.  In the essay  "The Year 2000: Social Chaos or Social  Transformation?"  consultants John  Peterson, Margaret  Wheatly and Myron Kellner-Rogers paint  their Y2K picture with broad strokes and  foreboding, laced with a delightful naivete  that allows a glimmer of optimism to  emerge. Looking specifically at "possible  social behaviors," these folks examine  four scenarios (developed by David  Isenberg) based on two variables: the  range of technical failuresâ€”from isolated  to multipleâ€” and the potential social responses: from chaos to coherence. In the  "Official Future" scenario,  technical failures are isolated and society doesn't  respond, thus nothing of  significance will happen.  They call this the "Official  Future," because it reflects  the current behavior of  most leaders and organizations.  In the "Whiff of  Smoke" scenario, technical  failures are isolated but the  public responds to these  with panic, so the response  becomes more problematic than the problem, like the smell of  smoke causing a crowd to stampede. To  contain the potential damage, leadership  might resort to "Techno-fascism," a non-  democratic, brutal intervention.  If we have large-scale technical failure  coupled with social breakdown, the scenario shifts to "Millennial Apocalypse," as  the political, organizational, and economic  systems come apart.  Finally, the "Human Spirit" scenario  (wide-spread technical failures met with  social "coherence") imagines a society that  calls upon each individual to collaborate  in solving the problems of breakdown. The  authors observe: "This requires that we understand Y2K not as a technical problem,  but as a systemic, worldwide event that can  only be resolved by new social relationships." They conclude their overview with  heartening observations about how humans tend to react in extreme disaster situations such as hurricanes or the Oklahoma  City bombing: humanitarian efforts, amazing creativity and resourcefulness, a sense  of shared purpose, et cetera.  This last perspective pulled me out of  my apocalyptic bummer and started me  thinking. Could there be an upside to Y2K?  In my utopia, this would prompt the worldwide paradigm shift of values I've been  longing for: suddenly deprived of our  techno-cocoons, human beings are startled  into a completely different relationship  with spirit and earth. We pass through a  divine keyhole together and come out sparkling and wise, loving and creative, pleasure seeking and compassionate. We fix  what we have harmed and build a new  world together.  While I do not mean to minimize what â€¢  promises to be a deadly serious and potentially life-threatening state of affairs, I am  beginning to see that to survive in the post-  Y2K worldâ€”even in its most benign outcomeâ€”humans will have to adopt practices that feminists have been advocating  for centuries. In the spirit of this madcap  optimism, let me share a few alternative  spins on Y2K, from a radical-lesbian-feminist euphoric state:  The Perfect Hex Scenario  Actually, Y2K is the culmination of a  witchy hex cast a few years ago by an enterprising and forward-thinking coven concerned with technological delirium driven >  by unbridled greed. Wanting a bloodless  revolution, the coven imagined a simultaneous world-wide intervention causing  major inconvenience, allowing a global  pause without human suffering.  Patriarchus interruptus! Without cell  phones, microwaves or terminals, in this  extended moment of magik, humans will  rediscover the visceral and spiritual pleasures of intimacy, community, and nature.  We will refuse to restore technology to its  former prominence, choosing instead to  develop a slower-paced, more open-  hearted and generous society where technology is used as a tool rather than a lifestyle. Witches Rule!  Survivalist, Feminist-style  It's bad. For those readers able to remember     back     this     far,     think  "Wanderground." For more contemporary  readers, think "Hothead Paisan" or "Tank  Girl." In the last days, we have to seek  safety in the boondocks, and then remember how to live without technology. Suddenly Monique Wittig's admonition to "try  to remember...failing that, invent!" takes on  a whole new meaning. The pace slows way  down, we're living close to the elements,  and our focus draws in, to the immediate  and the visceral. Unity is the way we'll survive. Contingency plans include compounds of kindred spirits in rural areas, exercising major diplomatic skills with possible un-kindred but crucial neighbors.  Bring good books and tools. Remember: we  make Michigan [Women's Music Festival]  happen every year, so we already have  some track record in this regard.  Nature's Ironic Revenge View  (Anthropologists' Pick): Because technology is an expression of human creativity in some form, it could be considered an  extension or outgrowth of the natural  world. The Y2K problem was caused by excitement, greed, and pure ignorance outweighing good sense, and thus could be  viewed as an organic self-correctionâ€”entirely predictable but nonetheless unavoidable. So in some ways, it may be viewed as  natural disaster: there is no actual blame to  fix, except to rue a system that seems to perpetuate its worst aspects quickly. Take-  home message: Our tendency to rush is not  good for the planetâ€”and it is the planet we  must serve, not ourselves. Prediction: after  some long-term hard times, we decentralize societies, reassemble in tribal circles connected by common ground and compassion, all revering the planet, the earth, as  central to our being. Contingency plan includes: serious visioning of positive futures,  and ultra-practical strategies for creating  same. Post Modernism will be forgotten,  thank goddess.  Worst Case Scenario  The demise of "life as we  know it" is gradual and grim.  Corporatism continues unabated.  The poor and vulnerable suffer.  The owning classes and white  men find ways to consolidate  capital and power in the short-  term, and persist in their quest for  immediate gratification and delusions of security in isolated protection. Kind of a Big Brother  tone, with a dash of Handmaid's  Tale, Tank Girl, and Snow Crash.  It's very slow, and very ugly. As  resources, food, and cash get  more and more scarce, the pow-  ers-that-be turn mean and punitive. Strategy: Time to gather the  women together to protect and  pass on what we've learned to fu-  ture generations.  They're going to wonder what happened to  us so we need to leave  a trail. Encoding in  Tarot cards worked  once, and so have  quilts: let's get busy  and create our generations time capsule so  our daughters' daughters' daughters won't  think they're the first  to challenge patriarchy. Write those journals, but hide 'em  well.  Take Charge Attitude  Fuck Y2K! Live  out that dream of a  convent with double  beds, the coven in the  wilderness, the lesbian  compound, the organic farm run by women and  their children, the old dyke's rest  home, the women's festival that  lasts all year, the men's re-education camp, whatever. But this  ain't no disco: it's the real thing.  We'll need to remember all the  mistakes we never want to make  again because we won't have  nearly as much time for processing. Advice: Plan to devote the  year 2000 to doing your dream,  practicing sustainability in daily  living and voluntary simplicity,  building community, and redistributing wealth and resourcesâ€”  just for the heck of it. Come 2001,  you'll be happier, no matter what.  As for me? My current contingency plans incorporate aspects of all-of-the-above. Between  now and the turn, I'll be found  doing Y2K community education  and organizing in my town. But  come my 50th birthday on November 2,1999,1 may change my  name to Kay Hag, and spend the  next year as a crone-in-training,  holed up with a group of beloveds, catching up on all the books  I've been wanting to read, writing all the books I've wanted to  write, and figuring out how to  put into practice all my Utopian  visions.

With the growing emphasis on corporate social responsibility and the pressure  on non-profits to pursue "partnerships"  with for-profit enterprises, these questions  take on greater urgency By definition, the  nature of a partnership implies a sharing  of power and decision-making over a  project. This is different from the traditional  charitable relationship between a hinder/  donor and a non-profit, which is based on  the exchange of dollars for pre-determined  project outcomes. Women's groups are well  aware that our goals and objectives for a  given project may conflict with the essential corporate goal of improving the bottom  line.  Our continued reliance on government  funding is both an issue of financial survival as well as a political issue. We maintain that governments have a responsibility to fund equality seeking groups to ensure the full participation of women in our  society. It has also been the position of many  of us that governments have a responsibility to provide core or operational funding  for women's groups, particularly in light  of some of the challenges to our survival  mentioned above. Negative experiences  with the project-based nature of funding  from charitable foundations, for example,  also underline our need for core support  from government.  We recognize that there is a hierarchy  of funding decisions on the part of both  governments and charitable foundations.  Funding for advocacy, research, and social  change or social justice activities is scarce.  Funding for Aboriginal women, women of  colour, lesbians, and women with disabilities is miniscule. Essentially, foundations  perpetuate a hierarchy of needs within their  funding that reflects the inequalities of our  society. The less acceptable (or palatable)  issues or complex issues that require long  term solutions rather than quick fixes are  most often at the bottom  of the funding eligibility  hierarchy.  When it comes to  raising money from individuals, women's groups  are also often faced with  unique situations. Any  fundraising effort must  include an element of  education and recruitment, as well as a request  for financial support. This  can lead to some interesting contradictions for  women's groups that employ traditional  fundraising methods. For  example, a group that includes fighting poverty in  its mandate would hardly  succeed by organizing a  fundraising "gala" for  which tickets are expensive and inaccessible.  In addition, we are  faced with such long-held  notions among  fundraisers and donors  that women will give time  (volunteer  hours)   or  money, but not both. This idea and others  come from the very complex relationship  between women and money that needs to  HÂ£ maintain that  governments  have a  responsibility  to fund equality  seeking groups  to ensure the full  participation  of women  in our society  f_J  be considered in any of our fundraising efforts since the majority of our supporters  are women.  In our efforts to pursue community  fundraising, we are also faced with unique  challenges. A number of us have come to  understand that our survival as individual  organizations and our goal of institutional  strengthening can best be met through  movement building. The  success of developing  this social movement has  a number of key requirements.  We require adequate  core support, opportunities to work together to  share resources, access to  resources  capacity-building resources, and support for  infrastructure like media  and public outreach. As  women's groups, we  have reached a place  where we are looking for  unique and innovative  ways to collaborate in  strengthening our women's movement and  thereby strengthening  our own organizations.  In the Spring of 1997,  14 women's groups in  Vancouver came together  in a model of collaboration and collective benefit  called the Vancouver  Women's   Fund.   The  founding members of the  fund include: Aboriginal Women's Action  Network, Battered Women's Support Services, Bridge Housing Society, Downtown  Eastside Women's Centre, FREDA Centre  for Research on Violence Against Women,  Liberty Thrift (Women Embracing Life and  Liberty Society), Positive Women's Network, SouthAsian Women's Centre, Committee for Domestic Workers' and  Caregivers' Rights, Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter, Vancouver Status of  Women, Vancouver Women's Health Collective, Women Against Violence Against  Women Rape Crisis Centre, and the Women's Research Centre.  Our response to the growing need for  resources among women's groups is not  just to improve our ability to compete with  each other for scarce fundraising dollars.  Rather, our response is to build the community for women. Thus, the Vancouver  Women's Fund includes newer and  smallerâ€”though no less necessaryâ€”organizations with little or no funding as well  as larger groups that are relatively well-established.  Our goals include building long-term  financial stability for women's organizations, as well as creating fundraising expertise in the women's movement, sharing our  resources whenever possible and raising  the profile of participating groups at the  same time that we increase public awareness of the issues represented by the member groups.  At the Vancouver Women's Fund, we  are committed to doing philanthropy differently, modelling ourselves on women's  funding networks which are committed to  democratizing both the means of raising  money and the decision-making about fund  disbursements. We are not establishing a  new institution but are maintaining a collaborative and collective approach among  our organizations.  In an effort to test our ideas about  fundraising collaboratively rather than  competitively, we undertook two events in  1997/1998: a summer "Sunflower Days"  event in September 1997 and a women's  Dance-a-thon on February 13, 1998. We  raised sufficient funds to be able to take on  the added risks of larger events, and we  have begun to build a public profile for the  Women's Fund and our member groups.  We also undertook a research project,  funded by the Ministry of Women's Equality, to assess the potential for corporate and  institutional partnerships with community  women's groups to pursue violence prevention projects. We are in the final stages  of editing the report and will be making it  available to other women's groups in the  next few months. The report, "Community  Partnerships to Prevent Violence Against  Women," will be posted on FREDA's website at http: / /www.harbour.sfu.ca/freda/  Jennifer Johnstone has been happily working  as a feminist fundraiser in Vancouver for the  past nine years and she loves to talk about  fundraising!

KI^F=SIS  FEBRUARY 1999 Arts  Pool-Hopping with Anne Fleming:  Fiction about real people  by Kate Hall  POOL-HOPPING AND OTHER  STORIES  by Anne Fleming  Polestar Book Publishers, Victoria, BC,  1998  Pool-Hopping is local author Anne  Fleming's first book. It is an engaging and  thoughtful collection of short stories. Perhaps the most striking aspect of Fleming's  stories are her characters. They are diverse  and believable. Each has a distinct voice,  from the sixty-nine year old man waiting  outside the bank to rob it, to the pair of sisters, still just children, trying to make sense  of the contradictions of childhood. Fleming  manages to draw out the humanity in all  of her characters by painting them in a very  truthful fashion, rendering them naked and  fragile.  While each story has its own rhythm  and setting, they are strung together by  characters captured in moments where they  seem very vulnerable. People caught in  life's complex web of events and emotionsâ€”a woman who has cheated on her  female partner and now finds herself pregnant, a man who kills someone in a car accident and then goes to the funeral to learn  about his life.  Fleming captures  the motivations that  lead her characters  to make certain  choices. Choices  that are sometimes  very difficult to applaud are made understandable.  My favourite  story, "The Middle  of Infinity," is about  Adrianna, a woman  imprisoned for her  involvement in the  Clayquot Sound  [anti-clearcut logging] protests. Narrating the story from her  jail cell, her cynical voice explains that her  less than noble motivation for attending the  protest was to be with her boyfriend, Dean,  and to please her activist mother. As she  reminisces, taking the reader back to events  preceding her arrest, Adrianna is caught in  a moment of faith,  briefly trusting her  ability to take a political stand for her  own sake:  "The trucks  bright-beamed, eat  up the gravel ahead  of us, wheeze to a  sudden halt. Dean's  breath is gone. It's  me standing on this  road, this loved  body blocking it."  Fleming ends  the story here. She  takes   the   reader  through doubt and  disillusionment to a fragile and rare moment of personal power and then leaves the  reader in awe of it. It is a very effective  story-telling method. She lays bare the  bones, brings the reader to climax and then  steps back to let one examine the scenery.  The book begins and ends on a humorous note. In the first story, "The Defining  Moments in My Life," the narrator goes  through her life from two distinct perspectives, as imagined by her mother while  pregnant and then as she actually experienced it. The results are (not surprisingly)  two very different accounts. The last story,  "Bugged," is sweet, explaining how the  quirks of everyday intimacy drove the narrator crazy. A good choice for beginning  and ending.  Pool-Hopping is a solid first book. It is  both thought-provoking and fun. The characters are real people with many flaws but  are easy to care about. It is a book rooted in  the stuff that makes up human livesâ€”the  misfortunes, the hope, the choices. I encourage you to pick it up and support a new  voice in fiction. I do not think you will be  disappointed.  Kate Hall is the founder of Delirium Press. Her  first book of poetry, The September Poems,  was published December, 1998.
