Sandra Currie, reporting on the board's  activities for the year, commented, we  have. been in a holding pattern this year.  That seems to describe the women's movement in general as we cling to our meagre  gains.  After mentioning board participation in a host of movement activities  (the Women in Jeopardy series, the Working Women Unite conference, the Mother's  Day events at Britannia, for example)  and another host of outreach activities  (the CRTC Task Force on Sexism in the  Media), Currie concluded: relations with  board members and stafifi workers were  marked by a spirit oh cooperation and a  very productive miking relationship de-  vetoped throughout the yean..

Gillian Marie  Meet the new  l/SW executive:  Three of the board members — Jan Lancaster, Judy Bourne and Susan Hoeppner — are  former staff persons. Jan Lancaster is now  co-manager of Munro House, the second stage  housing project for battered women run by  the YWCA.  Jan was extremely active with  BCFW in its early days, and brings to the  board a familiarity with the local women's  mmovement and a commitment to the ongoing  friendly liaison between the YWCA and VSVi.  This will be Susan Hoeppner's second term  on the executive.'.'A  community worker at  South Vancouver Family Place, Hoeppner  comments: I fael: very Strongly that  l/SW  should be directinQ its energies towards  non-feminist women in the community.  Also serving a second term is Judy Bourne,  as treasurer. Her commitment is to working  towards finding the additional funds we're  going to need to survive this year.  Other familiar faces will be the two workers on Kinesis, Joan Woodward and Cole  Dudley. Joan has worked on numerous VSW  projects, and regularly contributes her  time and skills to the office. Facilitating self-help groups and continuing the  access work provided by VSW are two of her  priorities.  The staff report, presented by Gillian Marie, stressed that the staff priority is one  of outreach. Assertiveness training, consciousness raising groups continue in the  VSW tradition. In addition, staffers are  involved with facilitating the self-help  welfare information service in the Skeena  Terrace area, near Boundary Drive. Later  this year they hope to facilitate the setting up of a similar group in a central  Vancouver location.  Marie also mentioned the staff work on the  issue of women workers in the home. Women  Workers in the Home is a group of women  concerned about the status of women in  the home and the lack of resources and  support skills available to them. They  have been meeting to share experiences and  skills and have put together a speaking  package for use in family places, community centres and by church groups.  VSW staff also continues its information  and referral work out of the office, and  operates the VSW lawyer referral service.  Speaking engagements in the schools, at  meetings and conferences, plus liaison  with the media are also staff tasks.  The annual report gives an account of staff  activities in multitudinous detail. VSW  will send you out a copy on request.  Rose Scott Koyama  Margaret Cunningham  1 am a single parent on welfare,  explains  Cole Dudley. I am particularly interested  in the concerns o{, single parent women,  and see sexual harassment on the job, daycare and abortion as priority issues far  l/SW in the coming year.  Margaret Cunningham, who has worked as a  volunteer at VSW, reorganizing the research  files, will be another newcomer to the executive. An economist, Margaret came to  Vancouver in 1977 to make a new family with  her teenaged stepdaughter. Having myself  experienced sexual harassment on the job,  violence — both physical and psychological-- in marriage, and criminal abortion,  I have a special interest in working with  women to achieve more power over our own  persons and our working lives.  Rose Scott Koyama is a community worker  whose job brings her into daily contact  with single mothers on welfare, who are  battling to make a life below the poverty  line. Some of the issues which most concern her are wage equality, opportunities  for women to live above the poverty level,  the right of younger women to participate  in sports and to choose higher paying  career training, and the right to choose  whether or not to have a child.  VSW deeply appreciates the work of the women on last year's board. They poured time  into keeping VSW strong, vocal and alive. Kinesis July 1980   3  LABOUR  Nannies aren't going to take it any longer; they're organizing  By Joey Thompson  An estimated 10,000 nannies and housekeepers in B.C. are waiting to see if  Labour Minister Jack Heinrich will remember to include domestic workers in labour  standards legislation amendments due to be  announced this year.  They have reason to believe he won't.  A group of the newly-formed B.C. Domestics  Association met with Heinrich recently and  the response was noncommital at best.  The minister mumbled something about understanding their plight but when it came  time for a firm commitment on including domestic workers in basic rights legislation,  he backed down.  The amendments will extend laws regarding  workers' basic rights to annual and statutory holidays, minimum wage, maternity  protection and an eight hour day — to farm  workers.  For the first time in B.C.'s history, farmworkers will have these basic rights, but  apparently not domestic workers who are  earning $350. a month plus room and board  to care for several children, cook meals  (sometimes prepare Point Grey dinner parties) houseclean, wash clothes and perform  other housekeeping duties.  Granted, a few are invited along to Hawaiian or ski trips, perhaps they are permitted to use the family Rolls and they  may partake of roast and Bavarian Cream  Pie. A few women may also enjoy a swanky  room in a ritzy 15-room house.  They have to clean that mansion  The catch is they usually have to clean  that house. And they live with as well as  work for their employer.  One woman kindly said: "But they get to  bask in the sun and write letters while  the kids are sleeping. I can't do that at  my job." Great, imagine trying to relax  when the children could be laughing, or  crying or needing attention. It's still  not time off from a hectic schedule. Many  nannies work 10 to 12 hour days as well  as babysit two nights a week.  Weekends off, mind you but then there's  the periodic request, "to watch the kids  while I run down to the store."  It's this exploitation that association  organizer Susan Hill wants to eliminate  by means of including domestic workers in  labour standards legislation. Protection  under the law means overtime for work after  eight hours, it would mean medical and  sick leave provisions, it would mean  Christmas and Dominion Day and Labour Day  off — something many folks take for granted. It would mean Workers' Compensation  Board insurance if she is injured on the  job. And it would mean at least minimum  wages.  "All the employers take their holidays at  different times, so the worker can not take  a full holiday herself. She must find temporary work to compensate for her employer's holidays interrupting her earnings.  Like other household workers, the day worker has no sick leave, maternity protection and is subject to the health and  safety standards of the home," says a brief  to Heinrich, prepared by the association,  Labour Advocacy and Research Association  and the Service, Office and Retail Workers  Union of Canada.  The brief specifies coverage for three  groups: the homemaker, the live-in household worker and the day household worker.  The homemaker works for the government's  long term care program and provides home  and personal care so that invalids or  seniors don't have to be put out to pasture in an institution.  There are about 5,000 homemakers in B.C.,  99!? are women ranging between 18 and 65  years. They are employed either by a  community agency or a private enterprise  firm — which charges double the wage and  keeps the balance.  Most homemakers earn between $3 and $4.50  an hour. She is usually paid only for the  hours she works — there is no meal allowance, break times or travel time, states  the brief.  Exposure to safety hazards in the home,  back problems from lifting clients and  doing heavy housework and stress from over  work are frequent complaints.  The live-in household worker receives room  and board as part of her wage. Says the  brief, "Many of the women in these jobs are  in Canada on temporary employment visas  which allow them to enter the country to  work in a specific job for a limited amount  of time. Usually they have families and  children left at home, whom they are  Barbo Hennius  trying to feed, clothe, house and educate  with the money they earn in Canada.  "Because their legal status in the country  is linked to working in a specific job and  because there are no laws which regulate  their working situations, they are often  subject to extreme forms of abuse.  "Live-in household workers are paid anywhere from $100 to $400 a month, plus  room and board. Pay cheques are frequently  delayed and pay slips infrequently issued.  This wage is supposedly for a 40-hour week  with adequate provision of room and board,  neither of which is usually the case.  "In almost every ease the women work in  excess of a 40-hour week. Some work regular 15 to 16 hour days and they are on  call 24 hours a day. The women follow  orders from their employers and are often  assigned a multitude of extra tasks on  top of the regular household work. Many  people complain of a lack of privacy in  the homes they must both work and live in.  Some are denied phone privileges, others  have had their mail read.  "Many women report not being given enough  food to maintain themselves for the working day. In many cases days off are  irregularly granted, and in some cases not  granted at all. Some women, even on their  days off, must prepare meals and make  beds.  "Statutory holidays are often the time the  worker's services are most in demand and  many women work on these days but are not  compensated accordingly. Few workers get  an annual holiday or appropriate compensation in lieu of a holiday. They have no  sick leave and no maternity protection.  Like household workers in other situations,,  they are exposed daily to the health and  safety hazards of the home — heavy lifting, exposure to dangerous chemicals in  cleaning products, etc.  "It is not uncommon for male employers of  household workers to demand sexual activity from the worker. As well, these  women are frequently the victims of overt  racism from their employers and their  employers' children and friends."  The day house worker is known as the  "cleaning lady". These women currently  earn between $4 and $5 an hour. They too  face many of the problems of the household workers.  The associations and SORWUC have asked  Heinrich for the following:  * That household workers be covered by the  Minimum Wage Act, Hours of Work Act,  Payment of Wages Act, Annual and General  Holidays Act, Maternity Protection Act,  Workers' Compensation Act, Truck Act and  Control of Employment of Children Act.  * That employers of household workers be  required to supply all the equipment  necessary for the worker to do her job.  Equipment should be in safe and reasonable working condition.  * That the labour minister assign inspectors to familiarize themselves with the  conditions and situations of household  workers, and to enforce labour standards  legislation with respect to these workers.  * That a third party should be able to  lodge a complaint on behalf of a household worker against an employer who does  not respeet the rights of the worker,  and the complainer retains the right of  anonymity with respect to the employer.  * That the labour minister establish liaison with the federal department of employment and immigration to ensure that  abuse of employment visa workers in B.C.  does not occur and that labour standards  laws are enforced.  * That long term care regulations should  specify the allotment of a clothing and  shoe allowance and travel allowance for  homemakers.  * That labour standards legislation be extended to cover farmworkers, horticultural workers and other B.C. workers who  are suffering from extreme forms of exploitation due to their exclusion from  this legislation.  Homemakers not sitting idly by  Homemakers, nannies and supporters are not  sitting idly by while Heinrich rewrites  legislation. There is a move afoot to  organize the women under SORWUC and the  task is a difficult and formidable one.  Houseworkers and domestics are hard to  find, let alone organize.  But if you are an inside-the-home worker,  or if you know of someone who is, and you  are interested in finding out more about  the domestics association or union organizing call Susan Hill at 732-3589 or the  SORWUC union office (684-2834).  Over to you Mr. Heinrich. G; Kinesis July 1980  Sandra Lovelace is going to the UN to  plead for Indian Rights for Indian Women  Sandra Lovelace is a Maliseet Indian woman  from the Tobique Reserve in New Brunswick.  She married a non-Indian. Under the Indian Act of Canada, an Indian woman who  marries a non-Indian man is stripped of  her rights and forced to leave her reserve.  Sandra Lovelace attempted to regain her  status through the Canadian courts. She  failed. Now she has petitioned the Human  Rights Committee of the United Nations for  a redress of her grievances.  Canada, like any country that is alleged  to be in breach of the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights, must submit a  written explanation to the committee within six months. The Canadian goverment completed its document on April 9.

The new campus,  to be built between Glen and Keith Drives  on the north side of Broadway, will be a  great improvement over the old in every  respect but one. The -old campus at 12th  and Oak has a daycare. The new one will  not.  At a public meeting June 19 city council  approved a rezoning application for the  $22 million building but decided against  including a daycare. Nine of the 12 public presentations made at the meeting  demanded that the new campus have a daycare  "Nobody is against daycare," said Aid.  Helen Boyce, "but we can't let a daycare  stand in the way of getting this job  done!"  Community groups speaking in favour of a  new daycare were: the ad hoc campus committee for daycare from King Edward; East  Side Family Place, Eastside Single Parents, Grandview-Woodlands Area Council,  Grandview-Woodlands Neighbourhood Improve  ment Program, Mount Pleasant NIP and the A  Kenworth workers strike for equal pay  for work of equal value  JiU Wight  Since May 21, 350 workers at Canadian Ken-  vrorth and 17 workers at Paccar of Canada  warehouse (a joint certification in Burnaby) have been out on strike.  The major issue in the negotiations and  ensuing strike has been equal pay for work  of equal value.  The concept of equal pay for work of equal  value is an essential one if women are  to achieve comparable wages with those of  men, particularly given that the jobs  we have traditionally worked at are ghetto-  ized — characterized by low status and  miniscule wages.  There are four broad categories used to  determine the value of a job — skill,  effort, responsibility and working conditions. By assigning a certain number of  points to each of these categories in a  given job, it is possible to ascertain the  value of the work involved.  The use of this formula objectifies the  value assigned to jobs and ensures that  wages are determined accordingly, and  not upon the prevailing labour market conditions, sexual or racial discrimination,  the presence or strength of a union, the  nature of the work being performed or  the job content or the current legislation (as is presently done).  The Canadian Association of Industrial,  Mechanical and Allied Workers (CAIMAW) is  fighting to end the wage discrimination  currently being practised against the  women working in the data processing department at Kenworth. These seven women  were brought into the bargaining unit on  February 27, 1979.  Upon certification they became subject to  the terms and conditions of the then existing collective agreement, except as concerned their starting rate. At the time,  that rate was $7.07 an hour as compared to  the starting rate of unskilled student/  labourers of $8.17 per hour.  Because all seven data processors are women and all but two of the 350 plant  workers are men, the refusal by the company to close the gap between the starting rates is clearly discriminatory  against women. In fact, company spokesperson Ed Blouin has stated outright that  it "is not a major economic issue" for the  company. "I guess you could say it was a  matter of principle," he added.  Union demands women's starting  wage equal men's  The union's position since the women were  certified into the bargaining unit has  been that their starting wages must be  brought up to those of the rest of the  bargaining unit.  CAIMAW rejected the company offer of  12$ and 8%  (plus COLA) over two years  because it would only widen the gap  between the data processors and plant  workers. In response, the company has  withdrawn all its proposals to date. The  struggle continues. 0.  Vancouver Status of Women.  The daycare, as Aid. Harry Rankin pointed  out, was indeed a very small item in comparison with the total budget allocated  to build the new campus. If a separate  building were provided for it, it could  run to $150,000 : one half to two thirds  of a percentage point of the total projected expenditure.  College principal Tony Manera repeatedly  stated that only 15 of the 45 children in  the old daycare were those of students.  This is because the daycare on the old campus was not administered directly by the  college, and so, no preference was given  to students. As is the case with most  other daycares, those who were most able  to afford the service were most likely  to get their children in.  Darlyn Jewett of the Eastside Single Parents Association told the meeting that the  daycare facilities in the area were already  totally inadequate. There was no way they  could meet the increased demand of King  Edward campus parents needing care for  their children.  Dan O'Reilly of the Grandview-Woodlands  Area Council pointed out that a recent survey of King Edward campus had revealed that  44$ of teachers knew of students who had  missed classes or dropped out because of  daycare problems. His Worship the Mayor  ruled O'Reilly out of order on the pretext  that he was speaking from the floor. But  — surprise, surprise — Volrich allowed  another unscheduled speaker to express his  views. This was Al Stusiak, president of  both the Britannia Community Centre and  the Vocational Instructors Association.  He was vehemently opposed to the motion  calling for the provision of daycare.  Aid.Harry Rankin's amendment to make the  provision of a 45-unit daycare centre a  condition of rezoning was defeated by a  narrow 5-4 margin. Alderpersons Darlene  Marzari, Marguerite Ford and Bernice Gerard supported Rankin. But the Non-Partisan Association majority (Aid.Bon Bellamy,  Helen Boyce, Warnett Kennedy and George  Puil) joined with Mayor Volrich to defeat  the amendment.  The other concern of the meeting was the  amount of space allotted for parking.  Should it be 540 or 590 spaces? This  question was debated at length, with no  mention of cost. Dollars are not the issue  when it comes to parking the car. Only  when it comes to taking care of the kids. 0_  Welfare Information  Service alive and growing  A welfare information service has recently  been organized by the Skeena Welfare  Rights Committee. The service operates  on Thursday afternoons from 1-4 p.m. at  2416 Cassiar (phone 255-3183). The purpose is to provide information and support  on welfare issues. If further action is  needed, the person needing support is  encouraged to attend a meeting of the  committee to discuss how best to deal with  the situation and get support from other  members.  The service is prepared to deal with any  of the problems facing welfare recipients,  from child apprehension to.late cheques.  We work on a mutual help model, in recognition of the fact that we are stronger  together than as individuals.  VSW is currently working with the committee. Through our collective experience  at Skeena, we hope to be in a position in  the fall to set up a similar service in  the central part of the city. Any welfare  recipients who would be interested in  working on a VSW Welfare Rights Committee  and on the service should contact Debra,  Cat, or Nadine at VSW: 736-1313- If you  are having immediate problems with welfare, call the Welfare Information Service  255-3183. 0 Kinesis July 1980   5  Vic General will resume its therapeutic abortions  By Maxine Boag  We recommend that the performance  o£ therapeutic abortions in acute  general hospitals be a matter between the patient and her physician  rather than a matter between a  physician and a therapeutic abortion  committee.  (Dr. Don Shorting, ^president of  Victoria General Hospital medical  staff, in a letter to Jean Chretien,  federal minister of justice,  May, 1980)  Since the stoppage of abortions at Victoria Generar Hospital, illegal abortions  have been performed on Victoria women.  Dr. Shorting, writing on behalf of the  hospital's medical staff, wrote that problems such as increases in illegal and  delayed, high-risk abortions have occurred  in Victoria in the last few months.  Shorting later said that a few doctors on  the Vic General staff had informed him of  illegal abortions having been performed on  their patients recently. The women had  not required hospitalization but had told  their doctors afterwards.  The two anti-abortion doctors who succeeded  in stopping abortions at Vic General for  the last few months were recently dis-~~  missed by the hospital's medical staff, and  replaced by a pool of about 50 doctors.  At a lively meeting last month, 70 doctors  from the hospital's medical staff voted in  an overwhelming majority to survey their  ranks for volunteers to join a new therapeutic abortion committee. Dr. Jack  Cooper, the present committee's "liberal"  chairman, will serve until the end of the  year, but the other four members will be  chosen each month by a lottery draw.  In a heated discussion of the proper role  of doctors in the abortion committee system, the two doctors were accused of taking  the law into their own hands, and were advised to go the federal government, if they  wanted to outlaw abortion.  The pro-choice doctors — who turned out  in full force for the meetings — were  extremely concerned about the restoration  of abortion services at Vic General, and  about pressure on Jubilee's facilities,  now handling a 300$ increase in abortions.  It is -hoped that at least 50$ of the city's  abortions will be done at the Vic General,  with the Jubilee committee handling any  requests that the new Vic General committee  might turn down.  It will take time to regain doctors'  confidence in Vic General  Dr. Shorting thinks that most of the 42  doctors who have so far volunteered, are  pro-choice.  But he is aware that it will  take some time to regain the confidence of  the doctors in this city who haven't  bothered to submit abortion applications to  Vic General for several months.  The meeting also directed their executive  to write to the federal government, and  explain the mess created by Canada's abortion law.  In the subsequent letter, Dr.  Shorting outlined the situation in Victoria, where the "therapeutic abortion  committees of the city's two accredited  hospitals have diametrically opposed  approaches to the processing of applications for therapeutic abortions." Urging  the government to either remove abortion  from the Criminal Code, or to modify the  Code to enable its interpretation to be  more consistent, Shorting listed the following problems which he said has occurred  in Victoria in the last few months:  "Provincial, regional and local disparity  in the application of the abortion law;  "Confusion, uncertainty, and anxiety in  the minds of the public;  "Delays in the performance of necessary  therapeutic abortions." (As the Badgely  Report tells us, on the average eight weeks  transpires between the time a Canadian  woman first visits her physician suspecting pregnancy and the performing of the  abortion. For each week the abortion is  delayed, the risk of complications increases 20 to 30%,  and the risk of death  Rapists can have honest belief in consent  without reasonable cause"! 1  A man's honest belief, even if false and  unreasonable, that a woman has consented  is a valid defence in a case of rape. This  is what the Supreme Court decided in their  June 4 ruling which convicted George Pappajohn.  If the "honest belief without reasonable  cause" becomes valid in Canadian courts,  women will have two options : either resist  forcibly even if we risk our lives in so  doing, or submit to the rapist at the risk  of having no legal remedy.  Svend Robinson,  NDP Justice critic, points  out that the "honest but unreasonable belief" defence provides an all-too-easy  justification to those men who believe that  women are objects to be abused at wWL. We  should be working to etiminate such attitudes, not to perpetuate legislative interpretations that will promote them."  Mr. Justice Lambert, Robinson pointed out,  upheld the opinion (in his decision on  Pappajohn in the B.C. Court of Appeals)  that the belief of the accused in the woman's consent must be reasonable.  However, all but one of the seven Supreme  Court justices who heard the appeal agreed  that no reasonable grounds need be established by an accused who claims that he  honestly believed the woman consented.  Mr.Justice Dickson made some horrendous  statements: "The facts of life not infrequently impede the drawing of a clear line  between consensual and non-consensual intercourse." He quoted with approval the  following: "it is easy for a man intent  upon his own desires to mistake the intentions of a woman or girl who may herself  be in two minds about what to do." This  same judge went on to comment: "the crime  of rape involves an act — sexual intercourse — which is not in itself either  criminal or unlawful and can indeed be  both desirable and pleasurable." This  Supreme Court judge thinks rape can be fun.  The Pappajohn decision reinforces the concept of women as property and leaves it  to judges like Dickson to decide what constitutes a woman's consent.  Write to the Justice Minister Jean Chretien, Parliament Buildings, Ottawa, and  demand that he review the definition of  rape in the Criminal Code, urging that he  redefine rape as a crime of violence in  which consent does not play a part.

Canada shares with India the dubious  distinction of having the largest proportion of second-trimester abortions: 155?,  in comparison to Sweden's 6.45?)  "Jfare illegal abortions." (In the "Right  to Life News", it states that countries  where abortion is prohibited — Belgium,  Burma, Columbia, Portugal and Taiwan —  there is at least one abortion for every  five live births, which is the same as  Canada's present abortion rate. The figures show that women have the same number  of abortions whether it's legal or not. )  "An increasing involvement in hospital  societies of pro-life and pro-choice factions".  (As we know, this has been the  case in several hospital board elections  across the province.  The pro-choice and  anti-abortion groups in Victoria are  currently conducting intensive membership  drives for the fall election of three  Victoria General Hospital board members. )  The doctors at Vic General do not expect  the federal government to alter the abortion laws as a result of their letter.  But  the protest in the medical profession is  mounting: Dr. Shorting told Kinesis that  the Canadian Medical Association intends to  ask the federal government again this year  to abolish the abortion committee system.

On June 18 John Da^ne,  Nigel Powell, and John Scholtens each  received 200  votes out of a possible 277,  taking all the vacant seats on the board.  During their nomination speeches all three  candidates condemned choice on abortion.  Adolf Hitler's Reich fell into ruins because it permitted abortions, announced  Dayne. If abortions are allowed to continue, "pretty soon it will be you and  I." "I feel I have to stand up and be  counted because I'm against abortion,"  said Powell. Scholtens informed the gathering that abortions could ease the way  for "post natal abortion" such as euthanasia.

We feel  strongly that no single interest groups  should be allowed to usurp control of a  facility so essential to the people of  the North Shore...

Great  day for a ball game! It didn't even matter that'our team, the feminists, had only  seven players and that theirs, the CBC,  had 16 (14 men and 2 women). We women  had the conviction of our feminist principles and the power of statistics on our  side. The CBC may have had numbers of  executives but they were on the defensive  and we knew it.  After ten years of seemingly endless submissions to the CRTC concerning the sexism  on our publicly-owned CBC, women's groups  were finally being listened to. In February 1979, representatives from seven  women's organizations which had made interventions against the CBC at the CRTC  hearings, had been invited to Ottawa to  attend a two-day seminar on The Portrayal  of Women in CBC Programs.  We had come away from that seminar with a  list of promises that CBC's president, Al  Johnson, had committed the CBC to honour  (see the box). One of those promises had  been to meet us again in one year's time  to report on the CBC's progress towards  fulfilling those commitments. No matter  that this June 5 meeting was four months  overdue; no matter that it was only for  one day or that the agenda gave we women  no time to respond; no matter that the  teams were unbalanced. We were the female  equivalents of David and CBC was looking  very much like an awkward, defensive  Goliath.  President Johnson started the meeting with  warm welcomes, statements of goodwill and  hints of great progress made since our  last meeting with him.  Then Gordon Bruce,  assistant vice-president in Corporate  Affairs, and Dorienne Wilson-Smillie, the  woman whose job it is to single handedly  rid CBC of sexism, reported on the progress made towards realizing last years'  commitments.  They said the policy and  language guidelines had been widely disseminated throughout CBC (although my  sources within CBC said they'd never seen  or heard of them).  Social Affairs Specialist appointed  The 'Social Affairs Specialists' (SAS)  had been carefully selected to cover  women's issues and events. (It took over  one year to find the English SAS, Marguerite McDonald since in the first round  selectors had wanted to hire a man. Although McDonald is a 'professional' reporter within the CBC, she's an unknown  to the Women's Movement).  The 'awareness sessions' were given to  senior management in 13 seminars across  Canada to approximately 250 people but  Dorienne reported that although they'd  succeeded in stirring things up, they'd  not been too successful due to their  overly ambitious goals. (My sources report extreme hostility from some participants and bureaucratic interference and  bungling as the major problems of these  groups. )  The sessions, it was reported, were being  rethought and redesigned from within the  CBC since it was too costly to hire outside consultants again. (Women Associates  are the highly qualified feminist group  who'd led the groups. Without their input the whole exercise will become an  'inhouse' affair).  The promised evaluation and monitoring  process, it was explained, was extremely  difficult and costly, so they were unsure  whether they could fulfil this promise  without sacrificing precious funds for  new programs. The statistics we'd been  given for this meeting (see the graphs)  they said were so general and inaccurate  that they were finally rendered useless.  (Why then did they give them to us, and  how can 'facts' like 985? of the anchor  people on the Nashional being male and  25? being female lie?)  On the issue of sexism in commercials and  promotional materials, we were told that  CBC's participation on the CRTC Task Force  on Sex Role Stereotyping in the Electronic  Media showed their commitment to developing anti-sexist guidelines. We were also  assured that they had very strict internal  guidelines for commercial acceptance  (although many women still report seeing  and hearing very blatant sexism on CBC.)  Affirmative Action programs, we were  assured, continued to be carried on internally with special assertiveness training  and career counselling given to their  female personnel.  The rest of the day was taken up by various department heads, News and Public  Sylvia Spring, VSW's media watchwoman  PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN CBC  PROGRAMMING: WHAT CBC  PROMISED TO DO:  The CBC accepts as part of its mandate the need to reflect in its programming the role of women in Canadian  society and to examine its social and  political consequences. The CBC believes that its programming should  also contribute to the understanding  of issues affecting women.  In applying this policy, CBC programming should:  • avoid the use of demeaning sexual  stereotypes and sexist language;  • reflect women and their interests in  the reporting and discussion of current events;  • recognize the full participation of  women in Canadian society;  • seek women's opinions on the full  range of public issues.  Affairs, Drama and Sports, both French and  English, radio and TV, reporting on the  progress made towards eliminating the  inequalities within CBC's programming,  hiring and promotional practices. All  prefaced their reports with statements  like, "Changing peoples' attitudes is a  long slow process", or, "You can't legislate sexism away" or, "Due to budget cuts  there are few new jobs open to men or  women" or, "Women need to learn to be more  competitive, develop some fighting  muscles..."  Margaret Lyons, Program Director for CBC's  AM Radio, and the only woman department  head reporting, gave a very detailed account of how she'd personally gone to great  effort to inform her people of the policy  and language guidelines nationwide. Then  she listed numerous examples of programs  that employed many women, dealt with  women's issues and used women as experts.  One of the examples she gave was of Sunday  Morning's use of VSW's spokespeople Gayla  Reid and Jan Lancaster on an important  woman's issue.  Lyons insisted that at least the women in  CBC radio were making great progress and  repeated that the stats given us were  utterly meaningless. In fact,it is true  that CBC radio has a better track record  in hiring women than does CBC TV. But  when I mentioned the fact that most of  the upper management in radio were still  men, not to mention virtually all of the  technicians, Lyons countered by saying  that most women aren't interested in going  into management despite her efforts to  encourage them. She inferred that they  weren't tough or ambitious enough. As  for technicians, again there were virtually no women applicants for the limited  positions available.  Mike Daigneault, Director of English News  and Public Affairs reported great strides  made within his department. Since the  mid 1970's the National News has moved  from one woman reporter to having 14  women in 'responsible' positions. (No  stats were given on how many men held  responsible positions in same). Apparently they are all outspoken, tough and  several are 'feminists'. (My feminist  source on the National tells me she feels  totally alone and unsupported and that  several women openly expressed fear at  being labelled a 'feminist').  In Public Affairs he boasted of 19 women  producers and associate producers (again  not giving stats on men) and pulled out  Adrienne Clarkson and Barbara Frum yet  again as examples of women who'd 'made it'.  He promised to promote women and said they  are presently 'grooming' some to take on  more management responsibilities. He explained that although it's tough to change  some of the old male bias in journalism,  he's personally committed to trying.  (I  told him privately of some of the locker  room tactics I'd personally experienced  within the CBC news room which seemed to  be 'news' to him.)  Jack Craine, Director of TV Programming,  reported on TV Drama citing several examples of more women entering management  and pointing out that of the four news  series planned for next season, all have  women in prominent roles.  For instance,  Ritters' Cove, produced here in BC, stars  a woman bush pilot and Flappers is about  a 1920's nightclub owned by a woman. Anne  Cameron (formerly Cam Hubert of Nanaimo)  was also pointed out as one of their strong  feminist writers.  Radio and TV Sports were singled out as  the 'bad boys', still entrenched in the  old MCP days, having hired no women to  significant positions. All the other department heads had great fun pointing  their fingers at this convenient scapegoat.  By the end of the day both teams were exhausted and depleated. Our side, the  'Davids', lost 5 members to departing  planes, leaving only Doris Anderson, President of the Advisory Council on the Status  of Women and myself representing VSW. Our  sisters turned over their slingshots to  us and asked us to take one united shot at  old Goliath. So we insisted that the  meeting be extended until we could respond  to all that CBC 'goodwill'. The following  points are a synthesis of our demands.  * That the CBC.encourage a change in the  Broadcast Act that would add the word  'sex' to the section forbidding discrimination against persons due to their  race or religion.  * That they set concrete quotas for themselves in each program area for employment and participation of women in all  aspects of CBC.  * That they immediately hire a woman as a ► Kinesis July 1980   7  WOMEN ON WELFARE  The ordeal of Florence Kemp  Wanting to work while on welfare? That's a crime.  By Jo«y Thompson/Province  "You just can't live a respectable life on  what they give you on welfare," explained  Florence Kemp. Kemp, a 31 year old single  parent has been found guilty by the court  of defrauding the ministry of human resources. Sentence will be handed down in  September following a probation officer's  recommendation.  The three day trial followed months of  investigation by ministry fraud officials  who discovered Kemp working at a Burnaby  homemakers service agency. She was collecting welfare at the time.  For Kemp, the four buck an hour permanent  job was a miracle. It helped supplement  a welfare cheque and gave self-esteem to  a woman who had been told she is unemployable.  Kemp quit school at grade 9 and never  learned to read well.  According to the ministry, moonlighting  while collecting welfare is out. Rules  require that a family of two or more declare any income, gifts or extras over  $100 a month. The excess is deducted from  the cheque which in Kemp's case was about  $440 a month at the time of the investigation.  Statistics Canada says the poverty line is  $638 a month.  "Every woman I know who is on welfare gets  extras through babysitting, her boyfriends,  or knocking on people's doors asking to  do some housework," Kemp says.  "And to  penalize you for working and call you lazy  at the same time is wrong."  Human resources officers charged Kemp with  cheating the government of about $2,600.  They said she earned money while caring  for the sick and elderly for about a year  but purposely failed to file the income  on monthly welfare cards.  Legal aid lawyer Diane Kilpatrick said  Kemp had to have the money to feed herself  and her child adequately.  She said Kemp  did not intend to commit a criminal act  because she believed she was morally entitled to the money.  During the trial Kemp recounted her experiences with social workers.  She said she had practically begged for  courses that would give her the equivalent  of grade 12. Three times she asked during  her long term on social assistance and  three times she was turned down despite a  that I had been on welfare too long."  Meanwhile, in the court decision which  found Kemp guilty of defrauding the  ministry of human resources, the jury  recommended that the ministry and other  government agencies "do everything possible to assist the accused to upgrade  herself."  Kemp also told the jury that she was  scared, intimidated and sexually harassed  Rell QEfc THOSe  WARE CHIS0JERS  \NITH OUK COMPUTER...

Says Kemp: "One social worker said, 'Yes,  we can put you in the course but the day  you complete your training you'll have to  be cut off welfare because then you'll be  ready for the job market.'  "I told him I didn't need education to  wash dishes or do janitorial work. I  was told I was a lazy bum, a bitch and  by a male social worker. She was told her  daughter could be yanked away and put in  the care of the ministry if she contacted  help through lawyers or women's groups.  Kemp stayed on welfare but sneaked into  a six-week homemakers training program  at Capilano College.  She later found employment at a Burnaby agency...and an  investigator at her door.  "What I did is completely unacceptable  to the welfare department but to me it  was a question of choice.  I don't see how  I can be found guilty after all I've been  put through."

We got no commitments to any of these demands. Instead it ended quickly with lots  of expressions of goodwill and a rush for  the door.  The ball game ended with no score.

The name change reflects the evolving activity of the organization. CARAL is now  not only working to remove abortion from  the Criminal Code by repeal of Section 251  — it is focussing increasing efforts towards the guarantee of safe, legal abortion for all Canadian women who may find  themselves unwillingly pregnant.  Dr. Henry Morgentaler informed the meeting  that the availability of legal abortions  is diminishing in Ontario and in Atlantic  Canada. He cited as evidence the fact  that a measurably increasing proportion of  the patients at his Montreal clinic now  come from that area.  Iona Campagnola, former federal Minister  of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport,  confided to the audience that her commitment to her objectives had hardened during  her latter years as a Member of Parliament  in response to the harassment and pressure  she received from the anti-abortion lobby  when she refused to support their position.  A panel of doctors and social workers, discussing the issue of abortion in the context of human sexuality, reminded the  audience that the position of the anti-  abortion, anti-birth-control lobby is  based on opposition to the expression of  sexuality unless it is linked to reproduction.  Dr. May Cohen, one of the panelists, also  quoted studies which demonstrate that to  deny a woman an abortion which she seeks  jeopardizes both her physical and mental  health and that doctors who refuse to  grant abortion requests are therefore  breaking the law. Section 251 of the Criminal Code states that abortions are permitted if the continuation of the pregnancy  wou-i-d, or would be likely to, endanger a  woman's health. 0  "We want to be free, we  want to live in dignity."  Chanting, "We want to be free, help us wipe  out poverty, hear our voices, hear our plea,  we want to live in dignity!", more than 250  welfare mothers and children rallied at  Queen's Park Toronto, recently to demand  a better deal for people on family benefits.  The Family Benefits Work Group, which organized the rally, called for "an annual  review of family benefits allowances" so  that "realistic increases in cost of living  are made". They also demanded housing  costs be fully covered so that "food money  doesn't go for rent" and appeal procedures  be improved so that mothers are not arbitrarily deprived of their income.  The protestors received backing from a  wide range of groups, including the Children's Aid Society, Huntley Youth Services,  Mothers Against Discrimination, the Youth  Services Network, Reform Metro, the Feminist Party, the Federation of Metro Tenants  and the Montreal Social Rights Coalition.  Work Group co-ordinator Maria Ociepka said  that families on family benefits live on  incomes up to 40$ below the Statistics'  Canada poverty line. Ontario pays the  third lowest family benefits in Canada: a  mother with two children gets only $6592  a year.  "After rent, these mothers have only 60  cents per child per meal left in their budget," she said.  "With high unemployment,  a day-care shortage, and no money for bus  tickets, they are really caught in a trap."  Ociepka attacked social service minister  Keith Norton for not caring for the "poor,  women or children" in this province where  "rich is right and poor is wrong".  NDP leader Michael Cassidy joined other  NDP MPPs on the steps of Queen's Park  wearing red t-shirts with the slogan, "We  support M.O.M. — Mothers Organizing  Mothers."  Cassidy supported the Work Group's demands  and accused the Davis government of taking  "Bread, meat and peanut butter out of the  mouths of children." He decried the  choices which the Tories' low allowances  "force mothers to make choices between food  clothing and other necessities for their  children."  Cassidy called for universal affordable  day care, and an end to discrimination  against single mothers. He pledged continued NDP support for the "hundreds of  thousands of people who have to live on  social assistance." Cassidy also demanded the return of succession duties and  criticized corporate tax concessions which  take money from others more needy.  Liberal leader Stuart Smith, to a cool  reception, attacked the government for its  treatment of welfare mothers and presented  the defeat of the Tory government as the  only solution. Asked by hecklers, "What  are you doing about it?" Smith responded,  "If it was not for the support of your  friends the NDP, the Tories would be out  of office now."  Smith supported increased allowances and  more open appeal procedures.  At a press conference following the rally,  a letter from Davis was read explaining  that neither he nor Norton could attend  the rally, due to their tight schedules.  "They have lots of time for Ford and  Chrysler," noted Work Group members. Q  , (Clarion)  Taking back the Toronto  night in the Beaches  Women took back the night' recently in a  march 600 strong through the Beaches area  of Toronto's east end. Armed with a variety of noisemakers, sparklers and flashlights, the marchers halted traffic on a  main thoroughfare and attracted a lot of  attention, mostly supportive, from residents and passers-by.  Organized by the Toronto Rape Crisis Centre, the march protested restrictions  placed on women by unsafe streets. Violence against women is on the increase in  Toronto, as it is elsewhere.

(Broadside info)  NAC: women's role in the  constitution a priority  The National Action Committee on the Status  of Women has moved to make women's participation in constitutional reform its  priority issue for this year.  "When we look back at the birth of the  Canadian constitution in 1867, we find the  'Fathers of Confederation' always in the  forefront. But where were the 'Mothers of  Confederation'? Women's special concerns  and interests were not taken into account,"  said President Lynn McDonald.  "Unfortunately, the situation today is similar  when we see our First Ministers at their  conferences. This time, Canadian women  want to right the imbalance by participating fully in the process of redrafting  the constitution."  Ms. McDonald announced that the National  Action Committee has written to Prime  Minister Trudeau with a proposal for involving women from all parts of the country in this crucial debate. She said  that the organization has requested  federal government funding for this process of consulting women.  NAC is now identifying those key areas in  constitutional reform which affect women  specifically. "For instance, on the First  Ministers' list of 12 topics for immediate  discussion, we see a charter of human  rights, and jurisdiction over family law,"  noted Vice-President Pat Preston of NAC's  subcommittee on the constitution. "Clearly, women need a constitutional guarantee  of equal rights. And women's interests  will be very much affected if jurisdiction  over family law is changed," she explained.  Government violates its  own equal pay laws  The Canadian Human Rights Commission has  found that about 3,000 low-paid civil servants, most of them women, are victims of  a violation of the federal equal-pay-for-  work-of-equal-value law.  The commission is now expected to order remedial measures which will cost the federal  government uncalculated millions of dollars  in back pay and future wage increases.  The investigation was instigated due to a  complaint laid by the Public Service Allia-  ance of Canada.  Quebec sexist handbook  pulled off market  A recently-published layperson's guide to  the Quebec judicial system has been taken  off the market following complaints that  the handbook contained sexist caricatures.

Women's groups, including the Quebec Council for the Status of Women, condemned the  publication as being clearly sexist and  derogatory to women.

(Socialist Voice info) Kinesis July 1980   9  PARTI: The Overview -  For most women facing the crisis of divorce or separation, the law is an unwelcome and often incomprehensible third  party sticking its nose in and making a  bad situation worse. There are too many  acts, too many courts, too many people —  lawyers, probation officers, counsellors,  perhaps family advocates or social workers, — prying, demanding information,  forcing us to remember things we would  rather forget.  At a time when we need to see a clear way  through the mess our lives seem to be in,  the law confuses us and dims our vision.  A clear, well-thought out, unambiguous,  comprehensive Family Relations Act could  do a lot to simplify the process of marital dissolution, and thereby decrease the  pain involved in that process. Unfortunately, the British Columbia Family  Relations Act (FRA) which came into effect  April 1, 1979, is not such an act.  We have been promised a new FRA for a  long time — almost since British Columbia's first such act was proclaimed in  1972. In December, 1973, a Royal Commission on Family and Children's Law was  established by the NDP government. Headed  by Thomas Berger, the commission had a  mandate to recommend changes in the law,  and could also test proposals for reform.  As a pilot project, it established the  first Unified Family Courts, which hear  all family law cases under the same roof,  instead of dividing them between Family  and Supreme courts. It recommended structural reform in the courts as well as  major changes in family law.  What Berger recommended:  Underlying the Berger Commission's recommendations were some very important concepts, some explicit, some only implicit.  The commissioners were agreed that:  * All persons should be equal under the  law.  * Marriage is a partnership of shared  responsibilities.  * The roles of economic provider and  homemaker are of equal value to the relationship, and the value of work done in  the home must always be recognized.  The British Columbia  Family Relations Act:  The Complete  Laywoman's Guide  By Jillian Ridington  with Ruth Busch  * Married women are economically competent.  * Families in crisis need quick and  efficient access to legal services.  * Children are valued members of society,  whose rights should be respected and  whose opinions should be heard, and whose  rights should not be adversely affected  by the lack of a legal relationship between their parents nor the breakdown of  their parents' relationship.  The Berger Commission recommended that  couples be allowed to sign contracts  "opting out" of community property provisions, as does the new Family Relations  Act. Since, in our society, more men  than women own property, such provisions  generally work against the interest of  wives. But unlike the new FRA (which is  based on deferred community property), the  commissioners advocated "full and immediate" community of property, (see box ►)  They felt that this system was the only  one which allows for "equality of responsibility and independence during marriage"  and "best acknowledges the equality of men  and women within the institutions of  marriage."  Shelagh Fruman: "Who  will benefit most from  the new Family Relations  Act?"  Jane Auxier: "The  Lawyers."  "Talking   Law,"    Vancouver  Co-op Radio, May, 1979  A Law is what it does.  Law Reform Commission of  Canada, Report on Family  Law, 1977  The commission's 13 reports were unlucky.  They were submitted in January, 1976, just  after the Socreds returned to power. Bill  69, the Socreds' first attempt at a new  FRA, was introduced the following year.  It paid only lip-service to the Berger  Commission's recommendations, and was  widely criticized, especially by feminists  (see Kinesis, November 1977)  Many Canadian provinces have introduced  new Family Law legislation in the past  few years. The best of these was enacted  by Manitoba's NDP government in 1977.  Similar to Berger's recommendations, it  was rescinded by Sterling Lyon's Conservative government when it came to power in  1978. Governments, especially the big and  small "c" conservative governments now in  power in the majority of Cmadian provinces, seem reluctant to recognize the equality of partners within marriage. They  seem to take the view that women are  "secondary earners", if they are earners  at all; that "housework" isn't real work  because it is not rewarded with a pay  cheque.  Although the value of "good household  management" may now be recognized upon dissolution of marriage, it entitles a woman  to maintenance only while the relationship  endures. Perhaps if governments begin to  recognize the value of child care and  home maintenance they would have to treat  seriously women's demands for pensions,  guaranteed annual incomes or wages for  housework, and day care workers' demands  for a living wage.  What does the new act say? How  does it differ from the previous act?  One of the good points about the new act  is that it is arranged in a more logical  way than the old one. It is easier to find  things. The act is broken down into six  parts. The first part, "Interpretation  and Jurisdiction", defines some of the  terms used. This could be useful, because  legal definitions and "usage" definitions  can often be very different. ("The better  to confuse you with, my dear.")>» 10   Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  For example, we all know what a .child is,  but the meaning of "child" under the FRA  is a very specific one, "a person under  the age of 19 years". (Under the juvenile  delinquents' act it's a person under 17, in  the provincial elections act the age is 19,  federal elections act it's 18 — no wonder  teenagers have identity problems!)  The old Family Relations Act had a very  complex and confusing definition of "parent". The new Act clarifies while confusing at the same time. A "parent" is not  just a child's mother or father, but a  step-mother or step-father who, through  formal marriage, or a common-law relationship of at least two years, with the  child's parent, has contributed to the  support and maintenance of the child.  A "parent" includes the "guardian" or the  "guardian of the person" of a child.  If you are still following, let's try  "spouse". According to the new FRA, that's  a "husband or wife", or  a former husband  or wife when the concern is around varying  or enfdrcing an order, or a person of the  opposite sex with whom you .lived "as husband and wife" for at least two years and  were separated from no more than a year  before you started action.  But there's a problem with the last definition: it only applies to part of the  Act. As far as property goes, common-law  relationships just don't make it; the part  of the Act that deals with "matrimonial  property" applies only to couples who have  been legally married.  So if you contributed either financially  or through housekeeping, child care, etc.,  to the purchase or upkeep of property with  a man to whom you were not legally married,  and the property was in his name, the  Family Relations Act does not automatically  ensure you an interest in that property.  As will be discussed later, you may be able  to establish a claim of "constructive  trust", or "resulting trust".  Interestingly, it's this section that's  being touted as making the new Act more  "egalitarian".  CUSTODY  The new FRA "consolidates and updates" the  Unified Family Court Act,  the Equal Guardianship of Infants Act,  and the Extra-  Provincial Custody Orders Enforcement Act,  as well as the old Family Relations Act.  So we have less acts to confuse us: score  one for the government.    But it doesn't  make any of the provisions that used to be  under these acts and are now in the FRA  work any better for women.  Custody cases may become slightly less agonizing,  because the new Act specifically •  empowers judges to appoint "family advocates" to take part in proceedings around  custody,  access,  juvenile delinquency and  guardianship issues.    S/he.acts  "in the  best interests of the child".     In the past,  it has been common for children to be  used as pawns in power struggles between  hostile parents,  and judges (who tend to  view anything new as blasphemous),  have  been reluctant to appoint'lawyers to act on  the children's behalf in such cases.    They  have often appointed the Superintendent of  Child Welfare to conduct an investigation  of the case instead.  Whether family advocates will be more likely  than social workers appointed through the  Ministry of Human Resources to take the  child's true best interests into account  remains to be    seen.    But perhaps the  process will be somewhat quicker; MHR custody reports have been known to take more  than six months to complete.  In a later section of the Act (Section 24),  the "Best Interests of the Child" are defined.    The factors that a court (or,  presumably, a family advocate) should take  into account are:  * the health and emotional wellbeing of the  child including any special needs for care  and treatment  * where appropriate,  the views of the child  * the love,  affection and similar ties that  exist between the child and other persons  * education and training for the child; and  * the capacity of each person to whom  guardianship,  custody,  or access rights  and duties may be granted to exercise these  rights and duties adequately."  There is a rider attached to Section 24:  it  states that the court can consider the conduct of the person when awarding custody  where the conduct may substantively affect  the factors to be considered.  What kind of conduct will be considered as  Marital Property Systems  Traditional Community Property: Inherited from  European civil law; in force in Quebec until  recently)  All property acquired during marriage is community and on termination of the marriage  the parties share the property equally. However, during the marriage the husband is the  sole manager of the community property.  Separate Property: Favours spouse with-greater  earnings. In effect in B.C. until April, 1979, when  new FRA proclaimed.  Both husband and wife bring into the marriage their own property. Property and its  products are the separate property of each  spouse throughout the marriage.  Spouses are considered economic strangers  until the marriage breaks down.  "It is this view of spouses as economic strangers which has created the morass of laws  which attempt to deal with the resulting inequitable distribution of property on breakdown."  (Law Reform Commission)  Deferred Community Property (basically, this is  the system now in effect in B.C., although there  are some variations)  Considers all property acquired during marriage to be the property of both spouses  equally, but the entitlement does not arise until  the marriage Is dissolved. During the marriage  the right to deal with the property remains with  the spouse whose name appears on the title.  Creates a future interest for one spouse In  property acquired by the other. Does nothing to  make positions of spouses more equal during  the marriage.  being contrary to "the best interests of  the child" remains to be seen. Will the  "bad conduct" of women be weighed more  heavily than that of men? For example,  would a judge consider a mother's having  several sexual partners to adversely affect  the "emotional well-being" of a child more  severely than it would a father's similar  behaviour? Will the homosexuality of  either parent be a barrier to custody or  access? Stay tuned.  GUARDIANSHIP  The FRA talks about the "guardianship of  the child" in a way that seems to separate  that from the person having custody of the  child. The way it really works is this:  the parents of a child are the guardians  until separation, when the parent who obtains legal custody of the child becomes  its guardian. The mother of an "illegitimate" child is its guardian. A child's  guardian can (and should) leave a will  stating whom she wishes to succeed her in  that capacity.  GROUNDS  One thing that is missing in the new Act—  and happily so — is the need to have  grounds  before you can be awarded maintenance, or a declaration that there is no  reasonable prospect of reconciliation  (known to lawyers as a "Section 44 event",  because it is described in Section 44 of  the FRA).  This "declaratory judgement" can be important because you need one, or a separation  agreement, or an order for dissolution of  the marriage or judicial separation, or an  order declaring the marriage null and void,  before you can get your share of the family  assets.  If your husband doesn't want to let you out  of the relationship, such a declaratory  judgement may be the best way to go. Because grounds are no longer technically  necessary, women may no longer have to  prove that they were justified in leaving  their husbands before they can make an  application for maintenance for themselves  and/or for their children.  Given that our Ministry of Human Resources  now makes it mandatory for women to apply  for maintenance from their spouses before  they will be granted welfare, the deletion  of this clause is very important. However,  that's theory. Practice may be different.  A woman's simple statement that she no longer wants to live with her husband may not  be taken as adequate proof that "there is  no reasonable prospect of reconciliation."  Lawyers, working on behalf of the spouse  who wants out, will probably still use  every possible shred of evidence of misconduct on the part of the other spouse to  get such a declaration. And if you don't  have a "Section 44 event", the part of the  Act dealing with the sharing of property,  (Part 3) doesn't apply.  The conduct of a spouse is not supposed to  be a factor in determining maintenance  awards any more; but if a woman is seen  as having "broken up the marriage", she  might have a hard time getting a reasonable  settlement. In practice, there is no way,  no matter what the Act may imply, that conduct will not be considered relevant —  though it may not be as determinative a  factor as it has been in the past.  In the past, a single "adulterous" episode  could mean the loss of all rights to maintenance. That probably won't be the case  any more — but having a series of lovers  may very well do it, and a woman's conduct  will probably still be judged more critically than a man's.  FAMILY COURT  WORKERS  Family Court counsellors have always had a  double role. They "counsel" families and* Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  enforce probation on offenders sentenced  by Family Court. Not only does this put  them in an ambiguous position which may  work against them being told the "whole  truth" about a case, it also gives them a  work load that makes it all but impossible  for even good, sympathetic and non-sexist  Family Court workers to do their job properly.  The new FRA no longer states that Family  Court counsellors have "the rights and  duties of a probation officer", as did the  old Unified Family Court Act, nor does it  say that they don't.  If they are to carry  on both sets of duties, and no more staff  are hired (not likely, in times of "restraint") Family Court workers will continue to be unable to give each case the  care and attention it deserves.  Vftiile feminists have not always been  favourably impressed with the attitudes of  all Family Court counsellors — especially  those who consider keeping the family together to be more important than women's  mental and/or physical well-being — good  counsellors can and sometimes do provide a  forum where women can talk about their  problems with a person who does have the  power to influence the courts on their  behalf.  JURISDICTION  The section on jurisdiction — which states  what courts can make what ruling and give  what orders — was ambiguously worded in  the FRA. As a consequence, there have been  challenges to the rights of Family Court  judges to make ruling under certain sections of the Act. At this point in time,  pending appeals, Family Courts are deciding maintenance questions only. Custody,  access, entitlement to the family home,  and all other questions are being dealt  with in Supreme Court.  Supreme Courts can also deal with maintenance, so it is best to start your action  in Supreme Court and avoid having a lot of  different hearings in different courts.  You do not need a lawyer to represent you  in Supreme Court; you don't always have to  have one in Family Court. But maintenance  awards in Supreme Court tend to be higher,  so you may end up better off.  PART II  Everything you  always wanted to  know about the  Family Relations  Act and never knew  who to ask  Will the new Family Relations Act  make it more, or less advisable to  live common-law rather than to get  married?  For example ...  My boyfriend and I have lived together far  faur years.    We have always rented an apartment.    Both o^ us work.    We have put most  oh our salaries into a joint chequing  account and most ofi our day to day expenses  have been paid out o& that account.    Some  furniture and household goods were also  purchased through this account.    We both  have separate savings accounts.    When we  bought a car, we trans fa.nr.ed fands favom our  savings accounts into the joint account and  wrote a cheque on that.    Now we are thinking o£ having a child together.    We don't  titie the idea o& legal marriage, and would  rather not get into it, but we will get  married i£ it is in our best interests to  do so.  Can we draw up a "marriage contract" without getting married?   What di^erences  would our getting legally married make?  Will being married and/or having a marriage  agreement make a di^erence ifi we ever  split up?   Would either action afifact a  division o£ assets, custody and access  rights, etc.?    I $ we do draw up an agreement, does it have to be failed anywhere?  There is some advantage to marrying if there  is property involved, because the FRA  would then give you the right to claim one-  half the family assets' if the marriage  broke up. When property is in the name of  one partner in a common-law relationship,  the other party has no claim under the  Family Relations Act, because Part 3 of the  Act (which covers marital property) does  not apply to common-law spouses.  However, a common-law spouse would probably  be granted an interest in property used by  both partners under the common-law principles of "resulting trust" and/or "constructive trust". The Rathwell case (see  Kinesis, June 1978) established these concepts as valid in common law. A "resulting  trust" is an interest that results from  direct or indirect contributions that made  acquisition of the property possible. This  would mean that you had contributed either  financially or through your work on the  property or through using your own funds  to provide necessities so that your  spouse's funds were freed up to enable  him to make the purchase, and that you and  your spouse had regarded it as your joint  property.  A "constructive trust" means that you have  an interest in the property through having  been involved with it — it's been your  home for a period of time, you've scrubbed  the floors, etc. But this might be a  little more difficult to get than an order  under the FRA and you might not get 50# as  you would under the FRA.  Because you have been together for more  than two years, all of the other provisions  of the FRA would apply. Maintenance until  you can become self-supporting, custody,  access, and restraining orders, ,,and orders  for sole occupation of a family home would  be available on exactly the same basis  whether or not you legally married. If  your partner has supported, or contributed  to the support of, your child for one  year (or since birth, if under one year of  age) you would also be entitled to support  for her until s/he became 19 or was self-  supporting.  You cannot have a "marriage contract" unless you are planning a marriage (in which  case it becomes effective only when you  get married) or are already married. A  marriage contract deals with the issue of  property upon dissolution of marriage;  that is, it allows you and your spouse to  make an agreement to distribute family  property in a different manner than would  be the case under the terms of the Family  Relations Act.  It is to your advantage to sign a marriage  contract prior to marriage if you are  bringing property into the marriage, and  do not want that property to be considered  "family assets" if and when the marriage  terminates.  If there are any assets registered in only  one name and there are children involved,  there's usually an advantage to making an  agreement early in the relationship, if  you can reach a consensus.  That way, you  can avoid the courts, and all the expense  that going to court involves. You also  avoid the possibility of having to try to  reach an agreement when tension and anger  are at their peak..  Although you can't have a marriage contract  without a marriage, there is nothing to  stop you and your common-law partner from  drawing up and signing an agreement to  distribute your jointly-held property in  the event of dissolution of the partnership. You can register this, or your  marriage contract, at the Land Registry  Office.  What's the difference between  Family Court and Supreme Court?  What kind of orders can you get  where?  for example, I recently lefat my husband  because he beat me.    I had to leave quickly  and so I didn't take my children with me.  I want to charge him with assault and I  would like to get custody oi my children  and the right to live with them in our  house.    WiM leaving my kids go against me?  Can I get an order to fan.ce him out o^ the  house and let me move back in?   Can I do  all this in one court?   What court do I  go to?  Unless you live in Richmond or Surrey, where  there are Unified Family Courts, you will  have to go to two different places. Recent  rulings have declared that the provincial  courts (Family Court is a provincial court,  the Supreme Court, federal) have no power  to deal with custody, or occupancy of the  family home or an order prohibiting entry  to the home.  But assault charges between spouses are  always heard in Family Court (a strong  argument could be made for having them  heard in Criminal Court, as non-spousal  assaults are, but that's another issue).  Your best course of action would have been  to see a lawyer immediately, and to have  had her/him apply to Supreme Court on your  behalf for an ex-parte order giving you  custody of your children, occupation of  the family home, and restraining your husband from entering premises that you and/or  your children were occupying.  "Ex parte orders" mean orders given a party  to the order, in this case your husband,  who is neither present nor represented.  They are given only in emergency situations  and are in most cases interim orders, valid  only until a full hearing with all parties  present can occur.  However, the judge would be unlikely to see  your case as an emergency at this time,  because you have obviously managed untile 12   Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  now. You will probably have to wait until  your husband is summonsed and gets counsel.  The longer you have been gone, and the  longer you have left your children with  your husband, the more difficult it may  be for you to get custody.  It is always best to be the custodial  parent (the parent who is actually looking  after the kids) when applying for legal  custody. The judge will consider the  fact that they are settled with him, that  "bonding" has taken place, that they  probably aren't in any physical danger or  you wouldn't have left them there, as  being in favour of your husband.  If you  have checked on the kids, phoned and (if  possible) visited them frequently, or  asked a neighbour to let you know how  they were on a regular basis, those facts  will work in your favour.  What about interest in family  assets?  For example, my husband and I are still  living together, but I want to leave. I  have no money, but I heard that the new  Family Relations Act states that I am  entitled to halfi the vaJlue o^ our house  and furniture. 14 I could get that, I'd  have enough money to live on until I  If there is a refuge for women (Transition  House) in your area, they could provide  you with shelter and support until you can  get maintenance from your husband and/or  the right to occupy your home. Unfortunately, most refuges are overcrowded and  cannot take all women who need help. They  therefore give priority to women with  children, and women who have been physically battered.  Your women's centre or social service  agency could give you information on  refuges. You could also apply to the Ministry of Human Resources for financial  assistance; they will require that you  apply for maintenance from your husband as  a condition of giving you support, but you  can get it in the interim.  Who's who in Family Court?  Fon. example, my husband and I separated.  We went to Family Court and they assigned  a counsellor to our case; she was supposed  to try and help us work things out.    I  don't know how much    I should tell this  person.    Exactly what is her job?   What  power does she have?   Vo I have to see her,  and give her any infanmation she wants?  I& I tell her things, will she tell them  could get on my fact.    Can I get an order,  befare I move out?  You can apply for a declaration that there  is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation between you and your husband; if  this is granted, you would then be entitled to half of all family assets. However, the time involved in getting the  assets is at least six months, which you  may not find desirable.  You may be better advised, if there is  physical cruelty or the circumstances are  really unbearable, to try to get a Supreme  Court order for sole occupation of your  home and for maintenance, from your husband.  To assist you in obtaining this, a doctor's  statement that the marriage situation is  affecting your health; or doctor's,  hospital, or police records showing that  your husband has injured you, would be  helpful.  to my husband or bring them up  and use them against me?  in court  Family Court counsellors are appointed by  the Attorney-General to work in Family  Courts and Unified Family Courts. Their  job is to "give advice and guidance" in  disputes around family matters, and to  try to resolve the dispute-. They may  offer to refer parties to other services,  agencies, or professionals. Confidential  information given to family counsellors  cannot be disclosed without the consent of  the person who disclosed the information,  not even in court.  You don't have to see the counsellor; you  don't have to tell her anything you don't  want to; you don't have to see anyone she  refers you to. However, the court can  appoint a Family Court counsellor to investigate any family dispute that is before  the court, and ask that the counsellor  submit a report to the court.  A similar report can be prepared by workers  appointed by Supreme Court on cases heard  there. If you refuse to talk to a counsellor appointed by the court, the report  will not represent your side of the case  well. Generally, the courts have a high  regard for reports that they have ordered.  What are my rights to assets owned  prior to a relationship?  I am divorced.    When my ex-husband and I  split up,  I got the house, but I had to  pay him $5,000 far his share o& the equity.  I am now in a relationship with another  man.    We are considering living together.  Since I own a house and he doesn't, it make  sense far htm to move in with me.    IjJ he  does, will that mean he has a claim on my  house?   Would he become part owner while  we were living together or only i£ we  split up?   Would it make a di^farence to  his or my rights i£ we got married?  Your ex-husband has no further claim on your  house, unless the case was decided less  than two years ago, and he applied for a  variation and proved to the judge that the  settlement was unfair.  Your present partner does not have a claim  either, so long as you are not legally  married, because common-law spouses have  no property rights under the new Family  Relations Act. However, if he lives in  your house for some time and pays for repairs, or guarantees a mortgage, or if  the two of you talk about the house as  "our" house — especially to third parties — he could, if and when you separate,  make a case that he had a "constructive  trust" interest in the property.  If you marry, the house would remain yours  during the marriage providing you didn't  transfer it to joint title. You would be  free to do with it as you wished, inclu- .  ding selling it.  But if you're separated,  the house would be considered a family  asset, unless you and your spouse had  signed a marriage agreement excluding it  and naming it as your sole property.  If you do marry, it would be to your advantage to have such an agreement drawn  up. However, lack of such an agreement  would not automatically mean you would  lose half your house. Part 3 of the Act  allows for disproportionate splits, so  he could be awarded an interest reflecting  the time and effort he had put into the  house, but less than a half.  Is property in one spouse's name a  joint asset during marriage?  Our house is in my husband's name.    I want  to start a business but he would prefer  that I Stay home.    I heard that the FRA  Act says that I have a hali interest in  the property, and I think I should because  I worked to help get the down payment and  I have maintained the house far ten years.  But when I went to see my bank manager  about taking out a loan on my interest in  the house in order to start my business,  he recused me.    He said that any loan  would have to be in my husband's name.  Wow come?  The half share of family assets provision  of the FRA only apply when the marriage  breaks up, not during the marriage (see  box). Under the Wives* Protection Act,  you could prevent your husband from selling the house without your consent, but  that's about the only right you have while  the marriage is intact, as far as that  property is concerned.  Because of the provisions of the FRA, most  bank managers are trying to get spouses  of any married person taking out a loan  against property to sign the agreement, no  matter whose name the property is in. That* Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  way, there is less confusion when a marriage breaks up and mortgages are held  against it that affect its value.  If parents have to support kids,  does it ever work the other way  around?  I am an old-age pensioner, and I live by  myself in a rooming house.    My son does  very well financially, but I don't see him  very o{ten.    He says he and his wifa have  a lot o{ obligations and he can't a{fan.d  to help me out.    They buy iwo new cars  every year and give a lot o{ parties.    I{  he could give me $50 a month, it would  make my Ufa a lot easier.    I could o{{ord  to buy more meat, go to a movie once in a  while, on. have bus lore to visit friends.  I don't think he would miss $50 a month  very much.    Is there any way I can get  him to give me some money?    I don't want  anyone to know about it.    It's hard enough  to admit that he cares so little about me  without having it in the papers.  The new FRA specifically states that an  adult child of a parent is liable to maintain and support a parent who is dependent  on the child by reason of age, illness,  infirmity or economic circumstances.  It sounds like you would definitely qualify.  The Act also says that the decision as to  the amount of support awarded should take  into consideration the child's other responsibilities and liabilities, and the  reasonable needs of the child. This means  that your son will have to give the court  a statement of his income and expenditures.  You can ask that the proceedings be private, and the judge will very likely consent to this.  It is usually the policy  that such proceedings are private. You  can apply in Family Court or in Supreme  Court. In Family Court the court clerks  will draw up the order, while in Supreme  Court your lawyer would do it. It would  probably be to your advantage to have  your lawyer draw .up the order, and your  son could be charged with court costs.  What about rights to maintenance,  and who sues who for "adultery"?  For example, I have been having an a{{air.  My husband faund out about it and is very  angry.    He says he is going to divorce me  and sue my lover far damages.    I know he  can divorce me far adultery, but I don't  understand how he can sue.    I was a consenting partner.    What are the damages  far?   Could I sue his lover i{ it had been  him that had the o{{air.?   I {he carries  through with this, does it mean I can't  get the maintenance money {rom him?  He could sue, maintaining that your lover  precipitated the breakdown of a marriage  that would have endured had your lover  not interfered. Since you consented, you  may have evidence that the marriage was  breaking down anyway. If the judge believes you, your husband's suit for damages may not succeed. If the suit does  succeed, the damages he could collect  would be for mental anguish, and for actual costs incurred — e.g., hotel bills,  legal costs, etc.  In a damages for adultery suit, the value  of your services as a wife, cook, home-  maker, etc. etc. would be calculated, and  there could be an award for the loss of  your services payable to your husband by  your lover. The action is clearly one  based on hurt to the ego of the wronged  spouse. Damages are usually less than  $5,000, but if your lover had happened to  be your husband's boss, or his best friend,  or was obviously much wealthier than he  is, more might be awarded.  Damages for adultery suits smack of all the  horrors of classic rape trials. Regardless of who is supposedly suing who, it's  the woman who is really on trial, and her  sexual character is the focus of attention.  The wife's general "promiscuity"  can be used as a defence. This kind of  action is really just "legitimate" harassment by a vengeful spouse.  There's a couple of positive points here,  though. Prior to the passing of the FRA,  women could not sue for damages and adultery. In common law, it appears to have  been a remedy available only to men.  Now the right to sue works both ways. You  could sue his lover if the situation was  reversed. Suits for "loss of consortium"  We own very little because he has always  drunk up all our. money.    I got a job as a  waitress but I won't be able to pay any  legal bills on what I make.    Can I get  what I want without spending money I don't  have?  Legal Aid can probably help you (see the  box at the end of this article for the  office closest to you). If they say you  aren't eligible, get a lawyer through  lawyer's referral or VSW (see box). If  the case is uncontested, it should cost  between $350 and $1,000; the high end  (loss of sexual privileges and companionship) are no longer possible, under the  new FRA.  By the way, since homosexuality is not  "adultery", there can be no suit against  a gay lover.  Under the new FRA, your adultery is no  longer a barrier to your being awarded  maintenance (this is an improvement; it  was, under the old Act). However, it is  a factor under the Divorce Act, and it may  very well influence the judge's decision  concerning your maintenance.  It would be to your advantage to seek  maintenance from your husband in the Supreme Court, under the FRA, prior to the  time your divorce comes to court. You  should get a lawyer to represent you in  court when you apply for maintenance.  However, unless you can prove it is impossible for you to become self-supporting,  you will be expected to provide for yourself within a reasonable amount of time.  Such factors as your age and previous work  history, and your child care obligations  will affect this.  Maintenance over the years can amount to  a substantial sum, and many women do not  really know their husband's income or  assets. For this reason, it's advisable,  to be represented in court by a lawyer  who can argue the merits of your entitlement to maintenance. Your husband will  have to provide financial records. Supreme Court awards tend to be more generous  than Family Court maintenance awards; they  have traditionally dealt with more "middle-  class" people, and have more realistic  assumptions about the cost of living.  What access do low-income women  have to legal advice?  My husband has mentally abused me and our  children far a long time.    I want to di-  von.ce him and get custody o{ the children.  would only be charged if there was a complicated separation agreement involved.  Ask your lawyer what her/his hourly rate  is. If it appears to be too high, you  can get it taxed down by the District  Registrar for the Law Society. If you  haven't signed a fees contract, you won't  be responsible for payments of more than  $35-$50 an hour, depending on the lawyer's  experience. Disbursements would be over  and above that amount. You can get a  substantial part of your costs back from  your husband by asking, solicitor/client  costs in the divorce petition.  If Legal Aid does deci.de you are eligible  (they decide each case- on ,its own merits,  and have no absolute scale) your lawyer  can later convert the case to a paying one  from you or your husband. This will almost definitely occur if the divorce is  contested, or if you get some substantial  family assets, or money from the sale of  your home if you had one. Legal Aid  states that it is the obligation of the  lawyer to get her/his fees from the client  if that is at all possible.  What about "conduct" and  custody?  I am a mother and a lesbian.    My ten-year  old child has been living with me and my  partner far the past two years, ever since  his {other and I separated.   At that time,  my husband signed a separation agreement  giving me custody.    But since my lover  and I have been living together, he has  been threatening to take my son away {rom  me.    The boy went to visit his {other far  his regular access visit tioo weeks ago.  His {other refased to let htm come back.  He says he is going to divorce me and demand custody on the grounds that my Ufa-  style is detrimental to my son's wel{are.  Can I get my child back?   Vo you think my  husband will be success{ul in his suit?  Unfortunately, your husband may very well p. Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  be successful.  "The best interests of  the child" are the criteria for awarding  custody. Most judges would believe that  the "best interests" of a boy of ten would  not be served by being raised by a lesbian.  Hopefully, the judge will take the boy's  wishes into consideration, and will also  look at your overall relationship with  your son.  the house -- painting, gardening, making  curtains, and so on — that I would rather  he had done or paid someone else to do.  He never thought I managed well enough  and always criticized me far spending too  much, no matter how hard I tried to save.  He never understood how much things cost,  or how much work it is to raise {our  children and run a house.    IX I take him  Your overall lifestyle in terms of job  stability, the home environment in all its  aspects, your overtness about your relationship — will it be obvious to the  neighbourhood so that he may be confronted  about it at school, etc. — could also be  factors.  Does the father of a child born to  unmarried parents have to support  it? For how long, and under what  circumstances?  Eight years ago,  I had a child by a man I  was living with at the time.    We split up  a couple o{ years later, but he was giving  me money {on. the child and mysel{ until  the child was six.    Since then, he occasionally has given me money to support her,  but he doesn't do it regularly.    I don't  really make enough money to support my  daughter Sheila very well; I could certainly use more money.    I heard that the  new  FRA has di{{erent regulations around  the time he is required to support us.  Can I get him to help out more?  Since he has supported her for a year, you  have a claim. He is required to contribute to the support of your daughter until  she is 17. If he has moved out of the  province, you will have to apply through  Supreme Court here, and get a reciprocal  enforcement of the maintenance order. If  he has a new family to support, you may  have a hard time getting much money after  all these years. As mentioned previously,  Supreme Court tends to make more generous  awards, so it might be to your advantage  to go there, if you can afford to.  What about business assets? When  can a wife be awarded a share of  them?  My husband and I are separated and plan to  dlvon.ee.    We are having trouble working  out a separation agreement.    He agrees  that I have a right to hal{ the house and  household e{{ects but says I have no right  to any share in his business.    I did without a lot o{ things so that he could start  his business, and did a lot o{ work around  to court, do you think I could get some  share o{ his business assets?  You definitely should have some claim; the  amount of it will probably be determined  by the length of your marriage and the  total amount of his assets. The Margolese  case, settled recently in B.C. Supreme  Court, established a precedent in your  kind of situation. In that case, the  couple had been married for 30 years. She  raised the children and managed the household; he ran the business. She also worked  on menial tasks in the business.  The court ruled that "in the case of a  long marriage, it was not intended that the  court endeavour to measure the respective  contributions made by each of the parties  and divide the assets accordingly." The  marriage was viewed as a partnership to  which both made contributions, and the  court divided all the assets accordingly,  50-50.  In a shorter marriage (say under 10 years)  particularly if it were a second marriage,  and in a case where the business or other  assets had been owned by one partner prior  to the marriage, or in a case where no  children were involved, the split could  have been very different.  What are the regulations governing  joint custody?  My child is 10 and wants to live with his  {other hal{ the time and with me hal{ the  time. Thn.ee years ago, when the divorce  went to court, we asked far joint custody,  but the judge said that was not possible.  He gave me custody.  I would like Stan's {other to have joint  custody because I travel a lot, leaving  him with his dad, and I worry that there  might be a problem while I am away that  my ex-husband would not be capable o{  dealing with -- i.e. that he might not  hove the legal right to give consent to on  emergency operation, etc.    Does the new  FRA allow far joint custody, and could we  apply far that now?  One advantage of the new FRA is that it  does allow that  "a court may order one or  more persons to exercise custody over a  child or have access to that child."  (Section 35(1)).     If you and your ex-  husband are in agreement, you can apply tc  the Supreme Court for a variation by consent of the custody order in your divorce  decree.  What do you do about a custody  order from out of province?  I live on on Indian reserve in North-  Eastern B.C.    I have a custody order fan.  my child granted by an Ontario court (her  {other lives in Ontario, and we used to  live there)    Is the order valid here?   I{  not, what can I do to get a valid order?  You can apply to the nearest Supreme Court  to have it enforced here. Since you live  in such a remote area, it would probably  be advisable to do as much of the preliminary work by mail as you can.  The social  worker at the nearest department of Indian  affairs should be able to refer you to the  proper agency.  The only problem you might run into is a  case in which the child's father came here  to where the child is living now, and  applied for custody before you got your  order validated.  It is possible (and it  has happened) that one province will give  one parent custody and another province  will award custody to the other parent.  If this were so in your case — if, for  example, you had a B.C. order and he had  an Ontario one, we would advise you to  keep your child and yourself in B.C.  What about the validity of B.C.  court orders in other countries?  I have a court order giving me custody o{  my child, issued by the Vancouver Family  Court in June 197S.    My ex-husband kidnapped hen. and took her to France.    What  can I do?  If you can afford it, hire a child-napper  and get her back, or go to France and do  it yourself. And do it right away before  the court decides that "significant bonding" has developed between father and  child since the kidnapping. That has  happened. Then get back here and get the  custody order validated by the Supreme  Court.  What does the * 'dum casta'' clause  and maintenance/division of family  property mean?  My husband is paying $100 a month far  child support and another $150 far my  maintenance which I use to help pay the  mortgage on the house we bought when we  were married.    I don't earn enough to pay  the mortgage mysel{.    I have a boy{riend;  we are considering living together in the  house.    I{ he moves in, would that mean  my husband can stop paying my maintenance?  Could he get an order saying that the house  had to be sold?   I{ it was sold, would the  money I've paid on the mortgage {rom the  maintenance received {rom my husband be  counted in his portion or in mine?  If your boyfriend moves in and starts contributing to the support of the household,  your husband could stop paying you maintenance on the grounds that you are living  common law with another man. He would  have to continue paying child support: the  child is his responsibility until maturity,  unless your new partner adopted her/him  with your husband's consent.  Your husband can  apply to have the house  sold (order for partition). If you have  contributed substantially more to the house  than your husband has, the court might divide it up in some ratio more favourable  to you than 50-50. The only way he would ► Kinesis July 198015  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  not have a claim would be in a case where  the house was in your name only and you  had been divorced for more than two years.  What's all this about the Family  Court not being able to make orders  under the FRA? What happens if  I've got one?  I got an order in June 1979 issued by  Family Court under the new Family Relations  Act, giving me custody o{ my children and  the right to live in our {amily home until  the children are all o{ age.    The home  would then be sold and the proceeds divir  ded.    I read in the paper that the new  FRA was invalid.    Does that mean my order  is no good now?   What do I have to do to  get a valid order?  Some sections of the new FRA can be dealt  with only in Supreme Court, rather than in  Family Court, as used to be the case.  That doesn't mean that the Act is invalid,  but it does mean that your order is not  enforceable.  In order to make it valid, you will have to  to swear out an affidavit. Your lawyer  will take the affidavit and the old order  to Supreme Court and get it confirmed by  that court. This shouldn't take too much  time or cost too much money if it is not  contested. You should not have any problem maintaining custody of your children,  since they are living with you, unless  there were serious problems and/or your  husband could make a very good case for  seeking custody.  What happens when you don't get  to court first?  For example, my husband le{t me last year  and went to the States.    I didn't know  where he was, so I didn't do anything  about getting custody or getting a separation agreement.-   This spring he wrote  and asked to have our daughter come far a  two-week visit.    He wanted her Immediately;  he said he had a vacation and wanted to  take her on a hiking trip.    She was very  eager to go, so I let her.    While she was  there, he got an order {rom a court there .  giving him custody o{ her. Can I get her  back?  Unfortunately, you probably can't. A court  here cannot give you custody of a child  who is not a resident within its jurisdiction — B.C. courts can only give custody  for children resident in B.C., and validate, or vary custody orders obtained in  other jurisdiction, if the child and the  custodial parent move to B.C.  You could try to get the custody order  varied,, or at least get access to your  daughter, if you have the time and money  to go to the state in which your child is  living, hire a lawyer there, and apply to  the appropriate court.  If your husband should bring her back to  B.C., or if she should come to you of her  own accord, you could apply to Supreme  Court here for a variation of the U.S.  custody order.  It's too late for this advice to help you,  but for other parents — make it a rule  never to let a child visitt an estranged  spouse -- even within the same city —  until a custody and access order, has been  issued.    An interim order can be obtained  in a day if necessary, and is extremely  good insurance. If you don't know where  your ex-spouse is, and want to be sure he  doesn't reappear, grab the child, and disappear again, leaving you without recourse,  an "ex-parte" order (meaning an order  issued without one of the parties to it  being present or represented by counsel)  can probably be obtained.  Even that order won't do you much good if  he really disappears. But if he can be  traced, you can get a court order directing  a peace officer to get your child from him  and return her to you. Then you could get  a restraining order, which would order  your husband to stay away from her and you,  and subject him to jail if he disobeyed  the order.  What are the conduct of spouses  and legal maintenance?  My husband was away far an extended period  o{ time recently, and during that tune I  slept with an old {riend.    He faund out  about it and says he is going to divorce  me and that I won't get any money because  I am an adulteress.    We've been married  ten years, and I have not worked outside  the home since our {irst child was born.  Is that right -- can he re{use to support  me {or that one act?  No, he can't refuse to support you for  your "adultery". Under the new FRA, the  conduct of the spouses is not legally a  factor in determining maintenance. The  things that the court will consider are  the respective roles that you and your  husband played in the family during the  marriage; and an express or implied agreement that one spouse would support the  other.  In your case, he was the wage earner and  you worked in the home, so it would be  expected that he should support you for a -  reasonable period, after your separation.  Had you been "promiscuous" and absented  yourself for long periods of time, or had  a long-term affair, the court might hold  that against you, but an isolated incident  should not have any effect on your rights.  You cannot expect that he will support you  forever, though. The Act says that there  is an obligation for you to be self-sufficient, and it would be expected that you  would take training or begin working fairly  soon. If you have pre-school children, or  other obligations respecting a child that  would make this difficult, the court will  take that into consideration.  If you are awarded maintenance and do not  make any efforts to start supporting yourself within a reasonable period of time,  your ex-husband could apply to have the  amount of maintenance cut. It's not clear  what would be considered "reasonable  efforts" during a time of high unemployment, especially for women.  How self-supporting is an ex-spouse  supposed to be?  For example,  I'm {i{ty years old, and  have not held a paying job since I married  twentrj-eight years ago.    My husband le{t  me and wants to get a divorce so he can  marry a younger woman.    I {eel that I am  entitled to support, because I spent my  Ufa, bringing up his children and keeping  house.    I couldn't get a well-paying job  now, and I'm too old to get long-term  training.    I understand the new FRA says  that a farmer spouse should become sel{-  supporting as soon as possible.    Should I  apply far maintenance in Family Court now,  or wait until the divorce comes to court  and apply far maintenance under the  Divorce Act?  It doesn't sound like your husband has  grounds to divorce you, and since it is he  that wants the divorce, it would be to  everyone's advantage for you to file for  divorce immediately. You will need a  lawyer for this. Under the Divorce Act,  an ex-spouse is not required to become  self-supporting. The amount you would get  will depend on your husband's income and  other obligations.  If you go to Family Court for maintenance,  you will have to apply under the FRA.  There would be an expectation that you  should become self-supporting within a  reasonable period of time. However, your  age, work history, and previous standard  of living would still be considered.  In either court, you would be entitled to  half of the family assets. If your husband has business assets, and if your  efficient household management was a  factor in his being able to get his business established, you could be entitled  to a share of those as well. That might  give you some investment income, and the  court would probably take that into account  and reduce your maintenance payments. Remember maintenance is determined on the  style of life you've become accustomed to  If he was a miser (even though he earned  a reasonable salary), you're probably  going to still be living in penury.  What does child support cover?  I am separated and am taking courses so I  can get a good job.    This means that I  have to pay {or day care far my three-year  old.    My husband is paying support and  maintenance, but the amount is not enough  to pay {or day care.    Can I get an order  to make him pay far this?  If there is no court order stating that he  has to pay you a specific amount, day care  costs can be an item included in calculating your needs.    If an order has been  issued, you can apply for an increase to  the court that issued the original order.► 16    Kinesis July 1980  FAMILY RELATIONS ACT  If your husband is making a sufficient  income to provide more funds, you will  probably be granted the increase. Both  you and your husband will have to give a  detailed account of your income and expenditures.  Who gets the kids when the  custodial parent dies?  For example, my husband died recently.  His ten and twelve-year old children have  lived with us far {ive years and are  settled in our community.    His ex-wi{e  wants custody o{ them.    I {eel they would  be better to stay with me, and they say  they want to do so.    What rights do I  have?    My husband did not leave a will.  It is too bad your husband did not leave  a will; if he had designated you as their  guardian upon his death, you would not  have to go to court at all. As it is, the  Superintendent of Child Welfare has become  their legal guardian, as he automatically  does when custodial parents leave no will.  However, you have an equal right to cus  tody; their biological mother and you will  be evaluated on what will be "in the best  interests of the child". A family advocate could be appointed, to act on the  children's behalf, or a custody report  might be done through the Superintendent  of Child Welfare, at the court's request.  The things that this court-appointed person will take into consideration will be:  the ties that the children have to you  and to their biological mother; if there  are other siblings (or half-siblings) who  live with her, or with you, and what their  ties are to them; the stability of the two  homes; the respective contributions that  you and she have made to their care and  support; any special needs of the children  which might best be served by living with  either one of you; your respective abilities/capacities as parents.  Your conduct, and their mother's conduct,  should only be considered in so far as  they affect the emotional, or physical,  well-being of the children. Since the  children express desires to stay with you,  and are settled in your community, there  is a good chance that they will be allowed  to stay with you.  What about property rights in gay  relationships?  Ten years ago, I began living with another  woman.    I had a good job at the time. She  owned a house, so I moved in with her.  Our incomes were about equal, so we  shared expenses; this meant that I contributed hal{ o{ the mortgage payments.    Last  year we decided to end our relationship.  Do I have any right to restitution far  the money I put into the house.  Because lesbian and gay relationships are  not covered under the FRA, and you were  not married in the eyes of the law, the  FRA section on property rights don't  cover you. But you obviously have a  "resulting" or "constructive trust" in  the property, and should be awarded a  share of it on these grounds. Under this  case law, you have as much right as any  other common-law spouse to a share in the  property, based on your attachment and  contribution in dollars and work to the  home.

LABOUR  Kinesis July 1980   17  MUCKAMUCK: A STRIKE FOR  INDIAN SELF DETERMINATION  It has been two years since we went out on strike at this white-owned, native staffed restaurant  located at 1724 Davie Street in Vancouver. We will continue to picket the Muckamuck restaurant until  a satisfactory agreement has been made between management and union employees. We are  certified with the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada, Local 1.  Some things have happened over the past two years that have made this dispute confusing for those  not directly involved. Seeing Indians inside the restaurant and on the picket line makes one wonder  which way the Indians are going. To clear the air, let us explain. A few of the original staff (some of  whom were union members) chose to cross the picket line and partake in strikebreaking action.  These people applied three times to the Labour Relations Board to decertify the union. They claimed  that the majority of the original striking staff were back at work. Twice, the LRB proved them wrong.  The third time they applied, they withdrew knowing they didn't have a winning case. The fact is, the  majority of the original striking native employees continue to support the strike. This can be checked  with the LRB and with SORWUC.  Why Are We On Strike?  We are on strike because the Muckamuck owners, Jane Erickson and Doug Chrismas, refused to  negotiate fairly with us after we were certified with SORWUC in March, 1978. Instead, they harassed  and fired union members. They attempted to bribe two union members by offering them management positions; and they held meetings with the staff to convince them that joining a union was not a  good idea.  Now the owners claim they are not anti-union, only anti-SORWUC. To stop the harassment and  firings, and to encourage Doug and Jane to negotiate, we decided to take strike action on June 1,  1978.  Closing and Re-Opening of Muckamuck  In response to George Manuel's letter to Muckamuck encouraging the owners to negotiate a fair  contract with the native employees, Jane wrote to George Manuel saying that because of the unfortunate situation (the labour dispute) she no longer wanted to be directly involved with Native Culture  in B.C. In June 1978 Muckamuck closed its doors and in October 1978 re-opened as the Chilcotin Bar  7 at Muckamuck. This new restaurant had a cowboy flavour with non-Indian staff attired in cowboy  hats and checkered shirts. The new menu offered beef burgers and steaks. The restaurant made  hardly any business as a cowboy establishment. Soon after, they reverted back to Muckamuck,  Indian style again. Despite their attempts to do good business and to ignore us, we have managed to  keep our picket line up and keep business down to 20% of what it used to be.  Violence on the Line  We have constantly been harassed and intimidated on the line by strikebreaking employees and antiunion rednecks. Because we wished to rally in front of the restaurant on our first anniversary of the  strike the union was given a court injunction allowing us to have only six picketters on duty at one  time. The court says it is because of the union pickets at the restaurant that incidents occur on the  line. This limiting of the number of picketters encourages the strikebreakers to provoke pickets with  more physical and verbal abuse. We are astounded by this court decision and think that all unions  should respond against such strikebreaking strategy supported by the courts. No matter, people  continue to respect our line.  Who Supports the Strike?  Native groups, including the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, United Native Nations, and the Vancouver  Indian Centre have given us their continued support over the past two years. Members of West Coast  AIM have picketted with us and continue to support us. SORWUC has received financial support and  constant encouragement from other unions. Members from other unions walk the picket line with us.  Teamsters refuse to pick up Muckamuck garbage. Passersby often give us words of encouragement  and donations to our strike fund. We are grateful for the help we receive from all our supporters. With  your help, we are able to continue our struggle for better working conditions, job security and decent  wages.  Why did we choose SORWUC?  We chose SORWUC because it is a democratic union where workers can in every respect, retain  control over all decisions concerning our work situation. With SORWUC, we are responsible for  writing and negotiating our own contract, and for planning strategy such as strikes. We work with the  executive of SORWUC and with other SORWUC members as equals. In no way, shape or form is it  another place where whites tell Indians what to do. We don't get discouraged because we plan  what's right for us and we know our union will stand by us through the best and worst that can  happen in this long and gruelling struggle for our first contract.  What Next?  Jane says she will negotiate with us soon. Twice, recently, she booked a room at the LRB to  negotiate with us. On the day we were to negotiate, she cancelled out. If our picket line is strong  enough to keep people from patronizing the restaurant and if we can maintain the same kind of vast  public support we've been getting, Jane will have no alternative but to bargain with us in good faith.  You can help us end the strike and win a fair contract by doing the following:  1. Write to us and send donations to our strike fund  c/o SORWUC Local 1  #102-402 West Pender Street  Vancouver, B.C. V6B1T6  2. Write to Jane Ericksonurging her to open negotiations  c/o Muckamuck Restaurant Ltd.  1724 Davie Street  Vancouver, B.C.  3. Come to the union office if you're in Vancouver to sign up for picketting.

The chief of police recently flew to Ottawa to press the  Justice Minister to tighten up the Criminal  Code...so that the police could more easily  charge prostitutes and have those charges  stick.  Kinesis worker Joan Woodward went to a  former prostitute to find out what the women themselves think about prostitution,  about the police, the pimps and the Johns.  KINESIS: What kind o{ woman becomes a  prostitute?   Can you tell us something  about your background, and about how  women get into prostitution?  MEG: I got into it, along with many of my  friends, I would say, mostly because of  the glamour. We were in our late teens  and early twenties, we were young, we had  moved away from our families, we were doing  poorly-paid, boring jobs. I ran across  this subculture where there were fast cars,  good-looking men, parties — a lot of  glamour! A lot of money floating around!  Hip kind of people. It was an underground  scene and it was a little bit forbidden  and I hung around it for quite a while before I did get involved ... but it had a  lot to do with having a sort of experimenting view of life and wanting to try  it. And I know a number of women like  that.  But there are so many ways a woman can  come into prostitution.  That's just one  of them. You know, where it was a hip  thing to do.  It was the most 'in' thing  to do, the most daring thing to do.  There's other women I know who've come into contact with that subculture and who  have been very lonely people.. They didn't  have close ties with their family or with  their friends and here was a place they  found acceptance.  It's complicated.  But when I sit down and  talk to my friends, there are some basic  things that women seem to have in common.  One of them is an early sexual experience.  They have had earlier sexual experiences  than women who come into contact with the  same crowd and decide not to become prostitutes. Sex was, well, part of their  life.  KINESIS: What about incest?   There's a  lot o{ research being done on incest  these days and one o{ the things they're  {inding is that young girls  [and young  boys in some cases too) who have been  sexually molested by a parent o{ten turn  up on the streets as prostitutes.    Vo you  see that connection?  MEG: Yeah, I really do.  In my experience  that's definitely a contributing factor.  I mean, something that keeps women out of  prostitution is the ideal they hold about  sex! That it's sacred to marriage, that  it's sacred to one relationship, and that  stuff. But if a young girl or a young  boy, as you say, has had an experience  which has shattered that illusion ..." it's  not a reality that sex is sacred, that  sex is only for one kind of relationship.  Where their sexuality has been taken advantage of, they learn to use their  sexuality.  KINESIS: As a commodity?  MEG: Yeah, as a way of getting what they  want. Whether it's a relationship,  whether it's material kinds of things,  sex is just part of what they have to  offer the world. And they can use it.  Whereas, say, a woman who was raised to  believe that sex was for marriage and for  marriage only (in some women's lives  that's a really strong belief!) — for  her to go into prostitution when she's  never had any sexual experience would be  a much more difficult thing to do. And  so the woman who had encountered rape or  incest — especially if it was a continued  thing, which incest usually is — would  be much more likely, if she had the opportunity, to go into prostitution.  But I should mention that I've known a  number of women who've gone into prostitution on their own — without ever having  been in contact with another prostitute  — for the money.  KINESIS: So It would be a question o{  economic need?  MEG: Very definitely a question of economic  need.  I mean, I can remember when.I was  younger, hitchhiking someplace, and some  guy offering me a lot of money to go to  bed with him. And I wasn't a prostitute  then, and I didn't have any money.  It  was a very tempting opportunity. Opportunities present themselves to young  women — particularly attractive young  women — a lot.  And if they're in financial need and all they have to do is spend  a half an hour of their time and they can  get money that it would take them a week  to earn ... it just seems reasonable sometimes.  KINESIS: What kind o{ money can a prostitute earn in Vancouver today?  It would largely depend on where she was  working.  If she were prostituting on the  street out of a need to support her heroin  habit, she could make anywhere from the  madam usually only keeps people who are  in demand.  Now a pimp is a different story. A pimp  is a relationship. A pimp is your man!  Your husband, the main person in your life.  The money you're earning in that relationship is his money. You work for him. You  know, a husband goes out to work and the  wife keeps track of the money and gives  the husband so much a week allowance — I  mean that does happen in some cases.  That's the rationale that pimps use.  Instead, you are the one who's got the  possibility of making the money because  you've got the pussy and there are men  willing to pay for it. So, the pimp says:  you go out and bring home the money.  I'm  the man, so I'll handle the money. You  give me all the money, all our money, and  I will give you what is necessary. You  ask me for it, and I'll give it to you,  but this is my money.  You know, the conversation that you would  hear beside you in an after-hours club  would be: "Daddy, look what I brought for  you!" The pimp would stand up and say,  "Quiet everybody, listen! My woman brought  home $500 tonight! Pimps and hose forever!" And the women would sit there  proud!  KINESIS:  I guess it's as much a sex-role  stereotyped relationship as any other.  price of a fix (which could be $35 and up)  to about $300 a night. It depends, too,  on the kind of tricks a woman gets.  If  she gets a whole bunch of tricks at $15,  maybe she's gonna make a hundred dollars,  or a hundred and fifty dollars.  KINESIS: That sounds like pretty good  money to most ordinary working women.  MEG: Yeah, but I think something most ordinary working women don't take into  account is the amount of time it takes to  find someone who's willing to pay to go to  bed with you, and then the amount of time  it takes to do that, and then the amount  of time it takes to get back on the streets  and to keep from being seen by the police.  It's not like men are going to come up to  you and pay you, one after the other.  KINESIS: What kind o{ a percentage would  the pimp or madam get?  MEG: The madam and the pimp are two different things. The madam has a house, or a  brothel. She takes a percentage which can  vary anywhere up to fifty or more percent.  And that's a business arrangement the  woman knows about beforehand. You're  reasonably safe from being arrested there,  and the tricks are brought in, and sometimes it's a busy night and sometimes it's  a slow night, and sometimes you're in demand and sometimes you're not. And the  MEG: Yes it is. Just as strictly sex-  role stereotyped and even more so sometimes.  The rules are really set down.  KINESIS: In connection with pimps, I'm  wondering whether prostitutes ever turn  their pimps in, whetheji the police go  a{ter pimps, whether charges are very o{ten  laid against pimps.    Vo the police really  go a{ter pimps, or don't they care one way  or the other?  MEG: In order for a pimp to be charged, a  prostitute has to go to the police, say  she's a prostitute and sign papers saying  that this pimp lived off the avails of  her prostitution.  It really doesn't  happen very fcften.  KINESIS: Would she be charged as well?  MEG: No she wouldn't.  There's nothing  illegal about being a prostitute. It's  that laws keep coming up to say that it's  illegal to solicit or that it's illegal to  be a known prostitute in a public place.  But being a prostitute isn't illegal.  Some women sign their men in.  It's always  a possibility, always a threat. A woman  can feel deep down that she could do this,  and the pimp could feel threatened by it:  she could sign on him, and he'd be in big  trouble!  But it's very difficult to get a woman to Kinesis July 1980   19  PROSTITUTION  sign against a pimp. There is a code of  ethics in the subculture. It's us, you  know (the subculture) against them, the  outside world. The police are the enemy!  They're not a friend. And so when you  get in trouble, or when you want to get  away from a pimp, or you're mad at him,  the impulse is there, the knowledge is  there, that you can sign on him. But  there's so much social pressure against  doing that! And if you go and sign on him,  what'11 happen is that there's usually a  lot of pressure from other women not to go  ahead with it. And if you don't go to  court, there's no case, of course. Unless  they can prove it some other way. And  the defence that the pimp has is to prove  he has another source of income, so that  while he may accept the money, he's not  living off the avails. It's a difficult  thing to prove without the woman's testimony.  KINESIS:    What about the links between organized crime and prostitution?    Can you  comment on that?  MEG: There definitely is organized crime  involved in prostitution. You know, it's  good money. That's what I would call the  white part of it: where the pimps are white  and the women are white. My own pimp was  black. There are both black and white  pimps, but they don't congregate together.  Very few white pimps hang out with black  pimps.  The white pimps are more along the  lines of mafioso. As far as a social system that's set up, I would say that'it's  the black pimps who have a social system  that's set up and that goes through every  city in North America. While the white  pimp would either be independent or someone connected in some way with organized  crime.  The police, you know, love to get the  pimps! The police harass pimps every  occasion they can. The police offer  bribes and incentives to women to get  them to say who their pimp is.  When a  woman gets picked up for prostitution, the  inevitable questions are, "Who is your  pimp?", and, "Isn't it a shame that you're  being taken advantage of in this way?",  and, "We're here to help you." And I  mean, no one believes them, except perhaps, the very young, naive girls.  Because the police have no respect for  prostitutes.The thing is, being that most  pimps are black and most cops are white,  there is an attitude: "I've got to get all  the pimps before they get my daughter, my  wife, my niece, out into that lifestyle  with their evil ways that they can use to  influence these poor, helpless women."  KINESIS: How strong is the {ear o{ retaliation {or a prostitute who testlfa.es  against a pimp?  MEG: There is some fear of retaliation  because it's such a strong code of ethics.  If a woman goes against it, it's almost a  matter of principle that she has to be  punished by the representative of the subculture, who is her pimp ... otherwise  other women might sign up their men, too.  If the pimp doesn't do something to stop  her, other pimps would be down on him and  try to do something about it. Or, if a  woman who signs on her man is held in  protective custody in jail, she will come  into contact with other women who will  try to talk her out of it. The subculture  couldn't exist without that code of ethics.  KINESIS:  I{ a woman loses her pimp, she  loses some o{ her livelihood, doesn't she?  Is she losing his ability to draw men in  fan. her?  MEG: Pimps have nothing to do with getting  tricks for her. Pimps have nothing to do  with the fashion show when she's out there  in the club or in the street or wherever.  So her income will not drop if she doesn't  have a pimp — she will keep the money!  A woman who doesn't have a pimp, though,  is considered an outlaw, and is called an  outlaw. It's said that she's not a real  woman, because a real woman has a man!  KINESIS: How Imperative is It far a woman  to have a pimp?  MEG: I mentioned 'outlaws', the women  who don't have pimps. It's almost like a  red rag in front of a bull. Here's a woman  who's raking in the money and taking it  home. And to a man it seems like that  could be his money if he could just get the  woman to work for him. There's a variety  of pimps. There are 'strong arm' pimps,  who will use physical force, beatings and  threats of death to try and get a woman.  And if a woman has no pimp...well, it's  just kind of sensible in a way to have some  connections, so that you're not alone out  there. It's a very, very rough place to  be.  KINESIS: What kind o{ protection does the  prostitute have against violence or sadism  on the part o{ her tricks?  MEG: She has no protection against that!  There are men who get_ off by putting  light bulbs up a woman's vagina or punching her in the stomach. I mean, if a pimp  even wanted to retaliate against the trick,  where would he find the trick? The trick  is the most anonymous part of the whole  highest rate of VD is among teenagers, for  those very reasons.  KINESIS: What about the argument that prostitution has always existed and always  will, therefare it should be legalized and  accepted as being part o{ society?  MEG: That argument really bothers me.'  When we think in terms of there will always  be people who need prostitutes, therefore  prostitutes should be legalized to ensure  a supply of them, my immediate thought is:  why not do something about the people that  need the prostitutes?  I would rather see prostitution decriminalized than legalized. That way, it's a  personal choice. Some of our choices are  not entirely under our control, so I  can't really see it as a clear Utopia.  But to decriminalize it would be to take  that criminal stigma away. I guess there  may still be a moral stigma, but at least  it wouldn't be set up by and for the purposes of the men who feel they need it.  It would be more in the control of the  women themselves.  If prostitution were decriminalized, the  laws against it or any part of it would  / would like to see prostitution decriminalized rather  than legalized  circle. He could be anybody from anywhere.  The prostitute won't usually even know  his name.  KINESIS:    It's been sold that women are  drawn into prostitution by being hooked on  drugs,   'Jjist.    Vo you think that's true?  MEG: No I don't. I will say that there are  drug addicts, young and old, who do support  their habit in that way.  But it isn't  a sensible thing either on the part of the  woman or on the part of the pimp to try  and get her hooked on drugs first. It  costs a lot of money to be a drug addict,  and everything about drug addiction works  against being a good prostitute. You have  a habit that you have to support; you don't  have the looks, the motivation, the physical  stamina to do the work. I mean, it's hard  physical work to go out there and be a  prostitute'.  KINESIS: One o{ the pro-legalization arguments around prostitution is that government control would curb the spread o{ W.  What do you think o{ that?  MEG: This is a real illusion that people  have about prostitutes. If a prostitute  had VD, she'd lose her customers'. A woman  wants to have a good reputation with men,  and if she's got VD, she will have a bad  reputation. For most women I knew, a regular check-up was just part of their routine. It's people who don't'know about  these things, or who are afraid to go for  tests for some reason, who are the most  likely to have VD. As a matter of fact, the  simply be taken off the books. If anyone  wanted to do it, it would be a personal  transaction between two people.  However, if prostitution were legalized,  that would encompass setting up regulations  about how it could happen: in what part of  townj how much the woman would be allowed  to charge; how often she would have to see  a doctor. Anil there would be the whole income tax matter. You'd have to have officials checking to see if the regulations  were being kept.  And the prostitutes  would have to be registered.  And the way  society's going with computers, almost  anyone would have access to that information.  It's very hard for a prostitute who's become a known prostitute to get out of prostitution, and legalization would just  make it harder. I don't see any advantage  in having it become a matter of public  knowledge. Do people want 'known prostitutes' working with their children?  Now a woman can get a job as a cocktail  waitress in a club, and the police can go  and say: "Listen, this woman's a prostitute  and she's probably plying her trade on  the side, and your c]!ub isn't going to  keep its licence if you have prostitutes  working out of here." It's a very plausible situation. The more public the information, the more difficult it will be for  women to leave prostitution.  KINESIS: Vou've been out d.{ prostitution  far {ive years now.   What are your faelings  when you look back on the experience?  MEG: There are somethings I miss... the  money.' I've been poor since I left prostitution; I've been extremely poor. And  sometimes, just sometimes, I feel very  tempted to go back into it, just sometimes,  for a night or two, so that I could be  a little more financially secure. I must  say that I don't regret the experience.  I've gotten an education that I never  could have gotten any other way.  But another thing I have to say is that  it's very difficult to get out. In my  case, it wasn't, because of my pimp. He  was what you call a 'sweet mac'.  He tried  to persuade me to stay, but that was all.  For other reasons, too, it's often very  difficult to leave.  But most of all it's  hard to leave a lot of money, when you  don't have any other way of making that  amount of money.  If you had, you probably  wouldn't have gotten into it in the first  place. As I heard Margo St.James say  once, "it's really difficult to convince  a woman she's going to be happier eating  hamburger than steak!"  Q 20   Kinesis July 1980  WOMEN IN PRISON  Battling for justice at Oakalla Women's Unit  Geri Ferguson has been active in the work  of prison reform — both while inside (on  auto theft charges) and since her release.  She is now facing charges of assault and  escape over a series of incidents arising  from the disgraceful conditions in the prison. Meanwhile, Geri Ferguson has charged  a male guard with assault. On the first  day of that guard's trial, another guard  testified he had seen him punch Ferguson  in the mouth, without provocation. The  trial continues on Sept 15. Cole Dudley of  Kinesis spoke with Geri .  KINESIS: How did you become involved in  the anti-prison struggle?  GERI:  .Yell, it was because of the things  that I saw when I was in prison.  Like  women being locked up for 30 or 40 days,  when it says in the rule book that you're  only supposed to be locked up for 15 days  at a time.  At one point six women barricaded themselves in a room to protest something and  they were told they couldn't have any food  until they came out and they didn't want  to because once you barricade yourself  you go all the way with it. So, they  were in a room for two days and they  weren't fed ... nothing. Then a goon  squad from the men's unit was called up.  Their room was right across from mine and  I could see everything out of my porthole.  I saw a male guard (the one that I've  charged) with an axe, just driving it into  the door. When the men got in through the  barricade, they started shoving and choking the women and stuff like that. That's  when I got really concerned about what  was happening in there. After the Proud-  foot Prison Inquiry there wasn't supposed  to be any male guards in the women's unit  but continually there are male guards  around.  KINESIS: You mean they are there not  only in crises situations?  GERI: Yeah.  I'd see that male guard that  I charged all the time going through the  women's unit doing what he wanted to do.  Nobody says anything about it, and he was  supposed to be removed after Proudfoot  Commission recommendations. He just  happened to land a job on outside maintenance, but he's inside most of the time.  They have a male nurse too. When a male  nurse is in the clinic the women don't  want to ask the doctor for an examination  because the male nurse has to be-right in  there when it's happening.  I remember one  time going down to the clinic when he was  there.  I wanted a bandage for my wrist.  He grabbed me by the shoulder and was  pulling me towards him.  I pushed him off  and flew out of that clinic pretty fast.  KINESIS: The other women in the prison  see these same things going on, yet most  o{ them do nothing.    Why is this?  GERI: Yeah, I have a hard time understanding that too. Especially when I see  a woman locked up for 48 days straight.  When she came out she was stuttering, and  she didn't complain about it. If that  had happened to me    You know, you're given this rule book that  tells you all the institutional rules,  but nobody goes by them. I don't know.  Maybe the women need more groups going in  there so that they know they have rights  and that they can stand up for them.  KINESIS:   Vo the women prisoners get together to discuss their own problems and  to give support to each other?  GERI: No. The prison supposedly gives  this class called Communication Skills,  but the women told me that the first time  they went to it, they made collages.  It  doesn't make a lot of sense to me. The  prison administration doesn't allow any  "radical" groups from out here going into  the women's unit.  KINESIS:   So your contact with other  activists and {eminists occurs mainly on  the outside?  GERI:    Yeah.  KINESIS:    And that encourages you to carry  on the {ight?  GERI: Plus the punishment that happened  to me.  Like when I was refused tampax,  and when five of us had to share the same  plastic spoon, and when we were told we  couldn't have cleanser for the tub — we'd  have to earn it. Those things were crazy,  and so barbaric. And being hand-cuffed  and stripped — that was so degrading. I  really felt they had no right to do that  to me because I was already punished by  being in solitary confinement for twenty-  three and a half hours a day. Then they  come up with this cruel and unusual punishment while you're still in solitary. That  really made me mad. What the women in  there need is a good strong leader. If  there's no one there to do that, they'll  just lay back.  KINESIS:    Vo the other prisoners resent it  i{ you rock the boat too much?  GERI: Oh yeah. OK, this is what happened.  Twice after I was out of solitary confinement I had some really strange things  happen to me. Two different women heard  from the staff that I was an informer for  Peacock (women's unit warden). If the  women didn't know me better, I could have  had my head beat in. Another time one  staff told one of the prisoners that if  she beat on me it would make Peacock happy  and nothing would be said or done about  it. Then I would have to be put in protective custody and locked away from the  others.  KINESIS: Vo the women in prison want the  changes you are talking about?  Well, not really. Not everyone. Jan  Taylor (she's dead now) was a prison activist and I used to see the poor woman get  tormented by other women and not supported  in her fight at all.  So, if they don't want to support me that's  OK. The guards did those things to me ,  not the other women. My biggest concern  is letting people know what has happened  to me in there and what really goes on in  prison. There arc shortages in staff and  increased assaults by the guards.  The  Peacock administration has been sued several times.  I don't know why she is still  in the women's unit. When she was sued  the last time, it was by a staff member  that Peacock had fired and it was for  $2400.  Peacock said then that we weren't going to  get anything anymore because she was  taking the money out of the budget. And  I guess she's done it because we asked  for money for furniture and she said that  the money wasn't there. How does she get  away with it? Is it because she's a woman  and the men are using her? I don't know.  KINESIS:    Why don't the other women  support your {ight?   It's theirs too.  GERI: I think a lot of the time the women  are quite happy where they are. Most of  the women there have been in and out of  prison for a long time. They've spent  most of their lives being locked up. Maybe they feel really secure in that environment.  I really try to put out to them  that this stuff doesn't have to go on; we  have a way of fighting back. For awhile,  when I was there, I got support, but now  I'm out I don't know what's going on. I  have no way of knowing. The prison administration doesn't want me disrupting any  more so they won't let any of my phone  calls or letters through.  KINESIS:    What changes would you like to  see?  GERI: Well, the medical facilities are  really bad. The women's unit depends a  lot on the men's unit because the men's  unit has a hospital, a pharmacy, x-ray  machines and all that stuff. Whereas the  women's unit just has a little clinic.  One of the reasons I was sent to solitary  confinement was because I assaulted a  woman nurse.  I had broken out in sores on  my face and scalp, (ugh, they were awful)  and I had them for about two months. All  I was given was acne lotion.  One night I  could feel my glands swelling and the  sores were getting full of pus, so I asked  to go to the clinic. When I got there the  nurse said she wouldn't talk to me because  I was too hysterical. When I finally saw  the doctor, he said I had impetigo and  that's a contagious disease, but they  didn't isolate me. So, here I am around  all the other prisoners with a contagious  disease, and they're (the prisoners) going  to come down on me if it gets spread  around. When I went to court after the  solitary confinement, they cut me loose by  mistake from Haney Court. I was loose for  three hours before they got me again and  during that time I went to see another  doctor. He told me I had scabies and lice,  not impetigo. The medical treatment really  needs to be looked into. It's just raunchy.  When you're first admitted you don't get a  pap, VD, or any kind of test. They never  check you for lice or crabs. Anyone can  go in with any kind of disease.  One woman complained for three months about  stomach cramps, to the same doctor. He  told her it was nothing and she just wanted  something to complain about. When she was  transferred to Twin Maples, they checked  her over and found she had cancer.  This doctor has a bad attitude towards  women. He thinks they're all a bunch of  whiners and eomplainers. There are no  women doctors. The men's unit have the  same doctor and they complain about him  as well.  Visiting rights need to be looked into  also. They put the visitors through so  much bullshit. The bathrooms are locked  during visiting hours and after everyone  has sat around drinking tea and coffee,  they suddenly find out they can't go to  the bathroom.  Now, if the administration thinks a prisoner may be an information source, they  refuse her to have visitors.  They also  can keep your mail back, if they feel it's  necessary. ► Kinesis July 1980   21  ACROSS CANADA  Quebecoises discuss priorities with Vancouver feminists  By Morgan McGuigan  The recent con{erence, "Let's Hear the  Quebecoises" was a {ine opportunity to  hear, women {rom Quebec assess their own  political events.    The viewpoint {rom the  women's movement is very dl{{erent {rom  what we are {ed by mainstream media.  In our coverage, we facus on what two o{  the women sold. Andree Cote is an executive member o{ the National Co-ordination  far Free Abortion on Vemand. Helene Vavid  is active in the Quebec trade union movement.  At the con{erence, very little was mentioned about the recent re{erendum. Instead,  the women facussed on the process o{ the  women's movement and its struggles. The  Parti Quebecois, {or {rom being "the answer" is just another organization to contend with in the battle far women's rights.  Andree Cote described women's struggles to  control their own bodies in Quebec.  This has been one of the major issues of  the past ten years. Due to the stranglehold of Catholic ideology, Cote explained,  it has been almost impossible to get abortions in Quebec hospitals: the hospitals  refuse to set up therapeutic abortion committees.  There are only three cities in Quebec where  abortion services are offered. The majority  of abortions are given in private clinics.  This is an illegal way out, tolerated by  the government because of the controversial  nature of abortion.  The case of Dr Henry Morgentaler is an example of this tolerance. He was tried and acquitted by jury three times for performing  abortions. Each time the provincial government overturned the verdict and ordered a  new trial. In 1977, the newly-elected PQ  dropped the charges and stopped harassing  doctors practising abortions in clinics.  The anti-choice movement is rampant in Quebec. Priests pass out their leaflets, as do  presidents of doctors' associations.  The Parti Quebecois introduced an abortion  policy when they first got into power. The  thrust of this policy was one of trying to  apply the federal law. Hospitals resisted  the attempt, and women still have to leave  their neighborhoods for abortions in Anglophone hospitals.  Ten years ago, as the women's movement  started, women came together around abortion as an issue. They organized in two  ways. First, they set up reference groups,  telling women where they could go to get  INSIDE OAKALLA ===================  abortions. Secondly, they formed defense  committees around Dr Henry Morgentaler.  Over the next few years, women's groups  evolved. They found they had to define  their positions. For example, that they  were fighting for the right of women to  have abortions, not the right of Morgentaler to perform them. The question was not  whether you were for or against abortions,  but that evey woman had the right to have  one if she so chose.  Another problem arose over lobbying. What  reforms were acceptable? The women's  groups eventually decided not to accept  therapeutic abortions, as that means that  three doctors, not the woman herself, get  to decide what she should do.  The most difficult argument came from the  left and from the nationalists: "we need  more babies." This political argument  posed a question for the feminists: "Do we  accept that one half of the population  should have their bodies regulated for  demographic or political reasons?"  Around 1975, women in the struggle often  saw themselves as the vanguard, calling  themselves feminist marxists. They gradually came to realize that the fight for  abortion is not being waged because it  will help destroy capitalism. The battle  is taking place because women have the  right to control their own bodies. That  struggle is in itself legitimate.  Women taking power over their own lives  is  revolutionary, said Cote. It is the  first step in learning to be free. Women  no longer link the struggle for abortion  with other lines and programs. Solidarity,  yes. But women reserve the right to decide on their own program.  A national coordination group has now  been established in Quebec.  It demands  free abortion on demand and clinics where  women and workers have control. Attempts  are also being made to decentralize the  struggle, away from Montreal.  Helene David talked about women and labour  in Quebec. A researcher and writer for the  Confederation of National Trade Unions  (CNTU) and the Quebec Federation of Labour,  David is also.a member of the Socialist  Workers Group.  David explained that the Quebec labour  movement contains three major bodies. There  is the Quebec Federation of Labour (QFL),  most members of which are industrial workers. It is affliated with the Canadian Labour Congress. Then there is the CNTU,  which is comprised mainly of service workers, such as hospital workers. The CNTU  originated in the 1920s as a fairly conservative, religious group, but has since  become more militant. Of its 200,000 members, one third are women. Finally, there  is the Quebec Teachers' Federation, with  100,000 members, two thirds of whom are  women.  There are women's committees in all three  labour bodies, which were formed around  1974-5. In 1977, the three women's committees came together to form one joint women's committee for labour. All three  houses of labour recognized the women's  committee, although the QFL has recently  withdrawn.  The women's committee has lobbied and won  from the PQ significant improvements in  maternity benefits, and have taken up the  issues of daycare, access to employment  and the right to choose on abortion.  David pointed out that the Parti Quebecois is not a party of labour, although the  social and nationalist issues come together  at times, such as the 1976 election when  the PQ came to power.  Hopes were high at first, immediately after  that election. But gradually it became apparent that the PQ was not going to come  up with programs generally desired by progressives. The women's committee has spearheaded some of the push for change against  the P.Q. ever since.    Q  KINESIS: Vo they have any education or  retraining {acilitles there?  GERI: There's a school but all I remember learning was how to play backgammon  and bridge; not getting any knowledge of  any of the courses I wanted.  KINESIS: They o{{er courses but don't  teach them?  GERI: Yeah, that's right. They don't  have the facilities to teach biology, art,  chemistry or anything like that. I don't  like the teacher. He just sits there  and drinks coffee and plays bridge; he  doesn't help the women at all. I think  that's really unfair. You can't finish  your Grade 12 and there's no job training  at all. There is a sewing instructor  though, but most often that instructor is  pulled into the building and used as a  guard. You can work in the laundry and  they have the kitchen where you can do the  dishes." But you don't learn how to cook.  And that's it. That's all there is.  KINESIS:    You have charged the male guard  that stripped and assaulted you?  GERI: Yes. The case was put over until  September 15. I really felt there was a  deal being made with the prison administration. After all, I'm not the first  woman he's assaulted. He split one  woman's head open and she had to get 18  stitches. The Crown Prosecutor was  wanting me to be quiet about this case  and also about the other things that  happened during that time I was in solitary confinement. He wanted those issues  real quiet. But then he was taken by  surprise when I turned up with my defence  committee! I'm quite sure that if it had  been just me, the guard would probably  have gone through with it and would have  got a fine or something. I think the  people that came there in support of me  really made a big difference.  KINESIS:    Vo you have any strategy planned  far the trial in September?   I guess  publicicity is what you need?  GERI: Yeah, and I've been getting it from  the Vancouver Sun.  My defence committee is planning on  putting up a whole bunch of posters and  maybe, making some leaflets.  KINESIS:    Vuring the episode o{ your  sores, you assaulted a guard.    Vo you  think you will be convicted on that  charge?  GERI: There's a good chance of it, because I've got a record. The image that  Oakalla has built up of me is that I'm  violent, uncooperative, and out of control. And I know I'm not like that, but  if I go into that prison atmosphere again,  yes, I'm going to be violent because it's  all around you. I don't want to go back  even to work with other women, because I  know what will happen — they will find  all kinds of excuses to keep me locked up  and away from the other prisoners.  When I go to court, I'm just planning to  tell them what went on for those months  when I was trying to get treatment. My  lawyer saw those sores and how awful they  were. He saw that I needed attention and  wasn't getting it.  KINESIS: I{ you don't go back inside,  what are your plans?  GERI: I'll probably work with Women  Against Prisons (WAP). Also I've got  quite a few women interested from Rape  Relief. So I can just continue my work  through their groups. 0_  As we are going to press, we learn that  Geri Ferguson is now doing 60 days on  the assault charge. Watch Kinesis {or  {urther developments. 22   Kinesis July 1980  BOOKS  Marilyn French's new novel  Dolores Durer is a depressing feminist: her love affair appraised  By Cy-ttaea Sand  Human relationships are the tragic necessity o{ human Ufa; that they can never  be wholly satisfactory, that every ego is  hal{ the time greedily seeking them, and  hal{ the time pulling away {rom them.  Willa Cather '  Marilyn French created a feminist fan club  with the publication of her first novel,  The Women's Room  in 1977. As a member of  that club, I greeted the news of her second novel with enthusiasm. The Bleeding  Heart angered, frustrated and moved me,  but it demanded a less passionate involvement than its predecessor. At the end of  The Women's Room,  we left Mira walking  alone on the beach, drinking brandy every  night and wondering if she was going mad.  Her dreams have become larger than life  and are obsessed with images of men with  large, vacuous, threatening eyes. No  longer a believer in Prince Charming, Mira  has chosen celibate solitude.  In The Bleeding Heart,  we meet celibate,  self-possessed Dolores Durer in a dream —  a dream of passionate longing for a male  stranger. Having been celibate for years,  Dolores is angered by her body's mutiny.  She feels disoriented in the morning,  finds herself crying:  Stupid.    Just the lousy sleep on that  damned bed, the lousy {ood, that  damned dream.   She {elt as i{ she  were about to disintigrate.  Dolores Durer, tenured American English  professor, is on a year's sabbatical in  England. Her disquieting dream occurs  during a sleepless night in a London hotel.  The next morning, she is returning to  Oxford where she is spending the year researching and writing a book on the Renaissance. Dolores meets her enticing  stranger on the train, feels overwhelmingly attracted to him and ends her years of  celibacy. Dolores, however, falls in love  with  the stranger, one Victor Morrissey,  an American corporate businessman, also in  England for one year.  Dolores is furious with herself:  When will you learn?... you were {ine  as you were, you were perfactly happy.  How could you let yoursel{ {all again  into the delusion that you can live  in any kind o{ peace with a man? How  could you farget that men are {uckers  In all senses o{ the word?  Why did French create this scenario?  But even more disturbing still is the question: why did French create such a scenario? What was her intent in having  Dolores (the name is from the latin meaning  pain) fall so out of self with Victor (the  name's connotation is obvious)? Lindsy  Van Gelder in her Ms. review of The  Bleeding Heart describes the novel as a  look at "contemporary men and heterosexual love from a sympathetic female point  of view." If so, the book reflects woman's  emotional dislocation under patriarchy in  a most disheartening way.  Dolores is an accomplished academic with  a deeply evolved feminist/socialist consciousness. Victor is a successful  corporation executive with an expedient  right wing consciousness. Dolores' integrity is necessarily undermined by the  nature of this affaire de coeur. Her  feminist outpourings are compromised by  her putative romantic fantasy that Victor  will change.    Dolores states quite clearly  at the beginning of the novel that what  she wants is for men to be like women.  Decidedly, however, Victor behaves and  thinks like the successfully, socialized  male he is.  Dolores punctuates most of their conversation with feminist facts and insights.  They serve only to frustrate Dolores as  well as the feminist reader. (I suspect  that the non-feminist reader could interpret this novel as a literary expression  of woman's sulky, unsubstantiated discontent).  One is tempted (but not too!) to sympathize with Victor when he protests and  argues with Dolores. The stage and script  are both designed for Dolores to appear  as a badgering shrew! What is she doing  trying to convert this fiftyish obtuse  twit, I was heard to mutter as I read the  novel.  The reader is introduced to the lives of  Dolores and Victor through a series of  flashbacks. They reveal each other's  lives over glass after glass of scotch or  brandy. (French's women do  love to drink. )  The pathos and tragedy of their lives (to  say nothing of Dolores' overnight conversion to romance), combine to make The  Bleeding Heart somewhat of a feminist  Harlequin Romance. Dolores' husband and  daughter both committed suicide in the  family garage. Victor's wife Edith was  left paralyzed after smashing up her car.  (She did so in response to learning of  Victor's extramarital affairs.) And  throughout the novel, Dolores describes  herself as a bleeding heart.  Dolores' love for Victor catalyzes a process of self-examination and introspection  which guides her along a path paved with  guilt, anger and profound pain. As she  reviews her life for Victor, Dolores becomes more and more engulfed by the  past. The rage which has festered for  years against her husband and her excruciating grief over her daughter's death,  finally demand expression.  Feeling abandoned in a hotel while Victor  is at work, Dolores gets drunk. She  gradually loses touch with her present  reality in a moving and well-written embrace of her past. She acts crazy. She  feels her truths. While wrestling with  her particular ghosts, she echoes the  emotional catch 22 of women dependent on  male love and approval:  That's what men did.    They knocked at  your door, you opened it, you were  glad to see them, you let them in and  they walked in carefally enough, but  in ten minutes they had their boots  up on your cocktail table and in hal{  an hour they were in your refalger-  ator.    In an hour they were In your  bed, and a{ter that WHOOSH', they'd  taken over your space, your Ufa ...  they simply assumed that because you  are a woman you are sitting waiting  {or them to come and take over your  li{e, to tuck you into a pocket o{  theirs, where, they assume, you will  be very very happy.  Dolores' disintegration may be understood  as therapeutic or as a socially sanctioned  response to institutionalized powerless-  ness. Exhausted and vulnerable the next  day, Dolores feels a deep need for  mothering. But Victor is angry with her  for such loss of control. He makes rough  hostile "love" to her. At this point, I  am angry and have lost patience with Marilyn French's record of reality.  It is disturbing to read novels by feminists in which strong women stagger around  in need of love from un/conscious men.  Even after learning of the cause of Edith's  tragedy, Dolores continues her affair with  Victor. Images of women suffering pervade  this book: Edith confined in her wheelchair, physically and psychically paralyzed by marriage; Dolores' daughter, dead  at sixteen; Victor's reference to Dolores  as a priestess of pain; the topic of  Dolores' book being Women and Suffering.  I begin to imagine what it's like to be a  Jew reading of the concentration camps, a  Black reading of slavery, a Native Indian  of the dissolution of a culture. And I  wonder, when is enough, enough? When does  the exploration of psychic, sexual and  physical slavery cross the border of knowledge and insight, into the abyss of  sterile despair?  Many women found the ending of The Women's  Room  depressing. However, I found the  image of a solitary, lonely woman on the  beach rather appealing.  It represented  strength of purpose, survival, a completion. Somehow I believed that Mira would  create a satisfactory matrix for herself  — despite her knowledge of woman's existential displacement. The ending of  The Bleeding Heart,  on the other hand, is  disheartening. Dolores and Victor are  parting after their year's affair to return  to the United States. Victor wants to  leave his wife Edith for Dolores. Dolores  says no. She does not want to become  another Edith and she knows Victor needs  an Edith to survive:  She knew that i{ he le{t Edith, he  would be unhappy until he had another  woman in a wheelchair.    That was the  only way he could {eel sa{e.  And yet with this horrific insight into  Victor's psyche, Dolores can still snuggle  up to Victor, knowing she'll miss him,  still loving him! The end. That  is psychic slavery. That  is depressing. (J)  Don't miss For Colored Girls  For colored girls who have considered  suicide when the rainbow is enu{{  returns  to City Stage July 2nd for an extended  run to August 2nd.  For Colored Girls  is black woman poet  Ntozake Shange's lyrical and dramtic celebration of black womanhood. The play  found its roots in the women's coffeehouses of San Francisco in the mid 70's  and moved from there to major theatres  on Broadway, London and throughout the  world. The play had its first Canadian  production at City Stage this April and  sold out every performance.  The July performances will be the same  Black Arts Theatre production. Performances are Monday through Thursday at  8:30, Friday and Saturday at 7:00 and  9:30. Tickets are available at the Vancouver Ticket Centre, 687-4444,  Q  What can you tell from a magazine's ads?  The June edition of Ms. magazine carries  an ad for The Club Vina Colada. Under the  bold heading- "Hit me with a club", we see  a woman's face with an expression which  looks to us like eager anticipation. Is  this feminist advertising? Kinesis July 1980   23  MOVEMENT REPORTS  New women's art gallery  planned  By Robin Barnett  A group of women are trying to form a cooperative women's art group and gallery.  We are hoping to include women in clay,  precious metals, wood, painting, drawing,  fiber, sculpture, photography, etc. and  women involved in non-visual arts such as  the■performing arts, music and art criticism.  We envision the gallery including a large  exhibition space for one woman or group  shows, a smaller exhibition space for work  in progress or new artists, a space for  members to show and sell their work and  office or probably studio space. Eventually we would also like to see a good  collection of women's art and craft books  for sale and a slide registry.  The exhibition space will show a wide  range of women's work, not just women who  are members of the gallery. We want to  encourage the articulation of the female  experience through the visual arts and  hopefully aid in the development of new  definitions of art and women's work. We  plan to exclude work that presents women  in any discriminatory way. We also hope  that the space can be used for cultural  events and events related to the works  shown.  Commitment for this project will involve  time developing the space, time working  in the gallery, time for group meetings  and a financial commitment. We are beginning with the assumption that we will  not have any government funding and will  be trying various means to make the gallery  self-sufficient.  The structure of the group will be non-  hierarchal and co-operative and women will  be expected to learn and execute a variety  of tasks on a rotating basis. We hope  that as a group we can support members in  the group and other women artists to expand their skills and share knowledge and  material aids.  There will be a written application for  membership which will help women present  their work and themselves to the group.  This will be available at a meeting on  September 16 at an as yet undetermined  place. For more information about this  please contact Jeanne Kamins at 738-8991  or Paula Levine at 228-8455.  0_  Lilith was fantastic  By Cole Dudley  Lilith has done it again.  For the second  time, this San Francisco-based women's  theatre collective has performed in Vancouver to resounding cheers from the community here.  On May 26, at the Robson Square Media  Centre Theatre, Lilith performed their two  pieces, Trespasso and Pizza.  Trespasso, written by Martha Boesing, was  an abstract piece of work.  It didn't  appeal to everyone's tastes, but was executed with much wit and polish so as to  render it enjoyable to all.  The two characters of Trespasso, Mick  (Vicki Lewis) and Agatha (Joan Mankin)  were hilarious and entertaining. Both  Lewis and Mankin showed themselves to be  accomplished actors, holding together an  unusual story.  After a short intermission, during which  the actors themselves changed the sets,  Lilith presented Pizza, written by  Michele Linfante. Pizza was wonderful: a  longer piece combining humour and the  delicacies of a mother-daughter relationship.  Lewis and Mankin again shone in  their performances, adding to the skills  and good performing of Reno and Marga  Gomez.  Gomez' portrayal of Bonesy and  the pinball machine was priceless.  Lfeny thanks go out to the sponsors,  the  Women's Building Collective, who brought  Lilith to our town. It's refreshing to  see good theatre with a feminist leaning.0  The Women's Coffee  House will be born again  By the new Coffeehouse Collective  In the spring of 1979, the Full Circle  Coffee House closed, due to burn out  of energy.  A fine-tuned piano and two microphones,  once instrumental in making musical her-  story at the Full Circle, and a bank balance of $21.00 have since been passed on  to a new collective of women to form the  active spirit of the "New Full Circle".  We estimate that the leap from 'spirit'  to operational non-profit, feminist coffee  house will take a minimum of $2,000. This  money, presently being raised through  benefits and donations, will ensure payment  of the first few months rent while we open  the space and organize it into a coffee  house (where you can get a decent cup of  coffee! ) a rehearsal space, a workshop area  and a women's music centre.  The first benefit was held January 17, 1980  at the Quadra.  It featured live entertainment — music by Judy Gumboots and Carole  Street and drama by Jocelyn Samson —  followed by dancing to women's music.  Over  200 women crowded the club for a successful fundraiser.  On Saturday evening, Feburary 28th, local  musicians teamed up to play to a full  house at the closing of 2133 Granville  Street (press club space) women's coffeehouse.  Quality performances were heard  from Carolyn Bell, Nancy Green, Edie  McKenzie, Carole Street, Kathy Smith and  Sandy Schofield and friends. Special  thanks go to Kathy and Dee for keeping a  Saturday night space open for women in the  community in lieu of a regular coffee  house.  We celebrated the rites of spring with 100  women at an extraordinary champagne brunch  at the Oddfellows Hall, March 30th. A menu  of crepes, eggs Benedict and Florentine,  champagne, plus extras, was enjoyed against  a background of classical entertainment  by Nancy McMaster, Rochelle Mingail, Karen  Wild, Rosita and Anne and friends.  On April 18th, Sisterhood Attraczions, a  fledgling women's production company promoted a concert/reggae dance as a benefit  for Margaret Marsh and the Nanaimo Women's  Coffee House Collective. Performing that  evening were Judy Gumboots, Carole Street,  Brass Tacks and Mona Arens; during the  intermission there was a video presentation of International Women's Day 1980 and  an anti-nuke literature table with representatives from Women Against Nukes.  The Coffee House Collective recognizes the  amount of energy and effort that went into  Sisterhood Attraczion's first production  and we appreciate the money that was  raised to support us.  . Attendance at performances has been less  than we anticipated and we realize that  our publicity and promotion must be increased to reach more of the women's  community.  Being relative newcomers to  the promotion business, we've had to learn  the hard way. Response from a goodly number of women has indicated that a coffee  house is of continuing interest to the  community.  We are open to dialogue, comments, criticisms and suggestions from other groups  and individuals. We can be reached for  this purpose at:  The Vancouver Women's Coffee House  Collective,  c/o 2045 West 13th Avenue  Vancouver, B.C. V6J 2H8 £  Women's Building eyes old  fire hall  By Gillian Marie  The Women's Building Planning Committee is  trying to procure, from the city, use of  the Old Fire Hall at 300 East Cordova  Street.  This space has been set aside as  an historical building, and the Women's  Building Committee will ask the city to  donate the building to the women of Vancouver.  The Old Fire Hall has an auditorium, two  workshop areas, a drop-in space, a daycare area and potential office space for  groups.  In the near future we'll be presenting a  brief to City Hall, outlining how women  could use the Fire Hall space. We need  your letters of support to accompany that  brief.'  We are continuing to meet over the summer  to catch up on our paper work: we're in  the process of applying for our charitable  tax-number, and we're making preparations  for the general meeting of the Women's  Building Trust.  In November, we plan tp sponsor a Theatre  Energy presentation in'Vancouver. Theatre  Energy is a women's theatre group based  in the Kootenays. They produce and perform exciting theatre with local content.  We'll keep you informed in the pages of  Kinesis.  Researching status of  women in the visual arts  By Sasha Hayman  I am conducting a research project for Status of Women Canada regarding the relationship of women artists, art students, art  teachers and art gallery employees to the  art establishment.  Some of the questions being studied through  questionnaires to the art establishment relate to who is making the decisions concerning distribution of public funds to  artists; who is defining what art is; sex  differentials in students bodies; which  courses women are being channeled into;  who's doing the teaching; exhibition opportunities and so on.  As part of the reasearch, I am sending  questionnaires to all art-related women  I have been able to locate.
