 ■June 198£  news about women that's not in the dailies Kinesis June 1985 1  Workers fight to  save Transition House  Vancouver Transition House is  up for grabs again, and women's  groups throughout the city are  outraged. They will be trying a  new strategy to fight the facility's imminent closure. Transition House was directly funded  by the Ministry of Human Resources until April 1984 when it  came up for privatization along  with 21 other social services.  Privatization involves the government contracting out a service to a sponsor group, which  then takes on the administration  of the service.  The YWCA picked up Transition  House's contract, but decided to  to pull out early last month  saying it was a drain on staff  and volunteers.  Human Resources Minister Grace  McCarthy announced on May 17  that Transition House would  close on June 30, when the Y  sponsorship terminates. She has  since indicated that it is unclear whether the house will  actually be closed down, but  workers are concerned that no  guarantee for continued funding  has been given. They have already been given their layoff  As a new tactic against further  privatization, workers and  concerned supporters met on May  20 to form a registered society  with the intention of submitting  an application to MHR to take  over sponsorship of the service.  The move would put control of  Transition House operation into  feminist hands, rather than leav  ing it up to whichever private  concern decides they'd like to  take it over under the auspices  of MHR.  Response to plans for the society have been encouraging, with  Board of Directors well underway at press time. They anticipate an application to the  Ministry will be made by June  10th.  However, there is no way of  . knowing if this new society  ill get the contract. Brook  Hill, a worker at Transition  House, says she is worrried  that the government may choose  another society as a sponsor,  or may close Transition House  and start another facility la-  r, with different workers and  less money.  Hill lays the blame for the  present crisis firmly at the  feet of the provincial government for their privatization  scheme. "The fact that the Y is  pulling out isn't their fault,"  she said. "It takes a lot of  energy and money, and it should  be the government's responsibility."  Statements from the Ministry  say there may be no immediate  need for the continuation of  Transition House, given that  there is a 15% vacancy rate in  emergency shelters in the Lower Mainland. This statistic is  misleading, based on the aggregate vacancy rate for shelters  as far away as Langley. Of the  96 beds referred to in these  statements, only 59 are in  transition houses specifically  designed to meet the needs of  battered women and their  children.  Transition House's own statistics reflect a different  reality. In 1984 the house  accomodated 187 women and 141  children. In the same year, the  house was forced to turn away  637 women and 700 children, a  total of 1337 people, for lack  of space. They note that far  from closing the house, a more  appropriate response would be  an expansion of its services.  There are 32 transition houses  in BC, but Vancouver's is the  only one with a direct phone  line to a worker 24 hours a  day. Transition House also  does extensive followup,  while other houses don't have  the resources to do so,  largely because they have  been even more underfunded  than Vancouver. Hill also says  the workload at Transition  House has increased since MHR  cut child abuse teams a year  and a half ago, leaving workers  no place to refer abused children.  "Our service has become more  drained, because there is no  place else they can turn,"  Transition House is fourteen  years old and currently employs eleven full-time and six  part-time workers  Eatons boycott finally ends  The Eatons boycott is finally  over.  In May, workers at six Ontario  stores on strike since November  30 signed a first contract.  They are certified in the Retail, Wholesale and Department  Store Union.  News about details of the contract, and how the rank and  file members of the union feel  about it, has been difficult  to come by, though it is certain that all the workers' demands were not met. One of the  key compromises means that not  everyone presently employed at  'Äûstore will have to join the  union.  The union may have decided to  take the contract because of  171 walkers raised $17,000 in the Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter's May 26  Walkathon around Stanley Park Seawall. After the walk 200 people gathered for a picnic,  with information tables and Women's fight back display.  Through fear  into power  The Moral Majority...Barbara  AmieJL.. .Neo-Fascism.. .Jim  Keegstra...the Klu Klux Klan..  .Ronald Reagan...R.E.A.L. Women  ...the Rise of the Right...Renaissance Canada...  All these words strike a note  of fear in the hearts of minds  of progressive people. The influence of the extreme right  wing on the current political  climate is steadily producing  an anti-woman, anti-human  rights backlash that will not  be ignored and can no longer  be denied.  .It's time for feminists to  examine the new right phenomenon, its program, its effects  and possible fight back strategies.  Is it a mass movement ?  What are its points of vulnerability ?  How can feminists effectively  counteract its propaganda ?  V.S.W. is sponsoring a two-day  forum for feminists to pull  together the information we  have and analyse where our move  ment is going on this issue.  Through Fear into Power: Feminists Examine the Right  will  feature speakers, theatre, audio visuals, an open mike, and  discussion groups.  Join us at the Britannia Cafeteria, June 8th and 9th.

The strike got support from  the women's movement across  Canada, with International Women's Day marches in Vancouver  and Toronto making local Eaton's stores the site of vocal  prote.st. 10,000 Toronto women  marched right into the store.  The contract will set precedent for retail workers throughout the country. The last drive  to reorganize retail workers was  in the '50's.

The message is if one "daddy"  doesn't satisfy you, another is not far  away.  Unfortunately, this is often the reality  for many childten.  So what is done with these daddy-rapists?  Though this question hasn't often been  addressed by feminists, it does concern us,  as most programs for convicted rapists are  mysogynist to some degree.  Choices are few. Once castration was considered, but aside from the obvious humane  consideration involved in opposing mutilation, it is also true that rapists could  still beat and economically starve us. Ta-  tooing rapists is a novel idea but provides  little security. They can be imprisoned  (where rapists are hated and often raped  themselves) but they are soon out - even  angrier.  A final attempt seems to be treatment programs (though the idea is not new.) Treatment programs vary from city to city, and  most are based on excusing the rapist as  deviant. Programs will go a certain distance, but not as far as to strip the rapist's control over sexuality - especially  that of children. (Some programs, even in  B.C., use child pornography for treatment.)  It is hard to believe the success of any  program when our present social conditions  encourage men to rape children. So it was  with skepticism and mild surprise that I  .••"5»»"  recently watched the television show  Frontline,  which featured 'Men who molest',  a story on the Seattle Northwest (NW) Treatment Associates program.  Northwest runs a day program for convicted  rapists. They live in their community while  attending the program. Northwest receives  over 225 men per week and many stay for  long term therapy (2-3 years).  The show examined four offenders who were  described as typical. The program consists  of lie detector tests, individual therapy,  and group therapy. Also shown were two  confrontations between the rapist and their  daughter.  The group therapy is based on the A.A. model. The rapist has to identify himself to  the group as a rapist and describe the assaults he committed. This approach is to  ensure that the rapist recognizes and takes  responsibility for his' assault. This often  means stiff confrontation from other rapists  in the group. As one therapist explained,  "The cloak of the offender is the secrecy.  The greatest expert in sexual deviation is  the offender."  Another part of the therapy is the reenact-  ment of the assault, only this time on a  rubber doll. The assault is filmed and  the rapist must then watch the re-run. This  often breaks down the rapist's rationalization of his assault.  N.W. therapists admitted that they were not  the experts and that programs such as this  are in their infancy. The success of such  programs cannot be determined as no follow-  up studies have been done.  The program hopes to demystify the offender.  As one therapist commented, "There is no  such thing as a person who could not be a  child molester."  Another therapist commented, "We (society)  make excuses for the offender - that they  were victims, they lost their jobs or are  having problems with adult relationships -  rather than focusing on the primary components - that this crime is pleasurable for  them - therefore it's repeated until it  becomes habit and then the need increases."  Though the Northwest program is encouraging  in One sense, it does fall short of any  feminist analysis of rape. -The rapists in  the program are taught to see themselves as  "sexual addicts" rather than made to recognize the power and control they have  over children. It is also questionable  whether rapists should be in the community while in treatment.  Northwest is not the answer but at least  it's a start. It is another way that society  deals with rape - by treating the crime  after the fact, rather than before. A real  treatment program for rapists should start  in kindergarten, teaching boys to be responsible for their sexuality.

NEW ZEALAND  Broadsheet, A ukland  Women's Bookshop, Christchurch MOVEMENT MATTERS  Working toward positive action  by Wendy Frost  On May 3-5, 175 women from  across B.C. came together at"  Douglas College in New Westminster to share information  and plan strategies on women's  access to college education,  at a conference entitled Where  Is Our Future? Women And  College Education In B.C.,  sponsored by the Status of  Women Committee of the College-  Institute Educators' Association of B.C. The conference  organizers aimed to go beyond  consciousness raising to concrete action, and to create  links between women in the  colleges and women in the  communities.  The conference opened the evening of Friday, May 3, with an  address by Jane Evans, Vice-  President of the National  Action Committee on the Status  of Women, on Women's Studies  as a political tool, followed  by entertainment featuring  local poets Sandy Shreve and  Leona Gom, Aya, a local women's  a cappella group, and Glee-  Club, a women's duo from Vic-'  toria.  Saturday's opening speakers,  Mary-Lynn Stewart McDougall  from SFU Women's Studies, and '  Jack Finnbogason, President  of C-IEA, stressed the impact  of restraint on the college-  institute system, particularly  focussing on funding and  governance of the colleges.  With this as background, Saturday's workshops covered a  braod range of issues affecting women in the college sys  tem: specific problems and concerns of native women, immigrant women, disabled students,  mature women and learning  mothers, unionized women in  the colleges, and educationally  disadvantaged women; cuts to  programs and services affecting women's studies programs,  women in the arts, "bridging"  programs, and Employment Orientation for Women programs.  The focus of Sunday's session  was strategy and action. Dr.  Pauline Jewett, M.P. former  federal NDP education critic,  spoke on the role of the  federal government in post-  secondary education, and the  responsibility of the provincial government to pass-on  the federal transfer payments  earmarked for education. Her  Canada's first women of colour press  Sister Vision, the first press  for Black women and women of  colour to be established in  Canada, seeks manuscripts,  ideas, and donations.  Sister Vision was founded in  the summer of '84 by Black women and women of colour "because we feel strongly that  more of our works must be published and read."  The press will encourage works  by women of all cultures, sexual preferences and classes,  and will focus on four areas:  women's oral history, creative  writing, books for children and  young people, and theory and  research.  ThS press will provide a forum  for theoretical works which  speak to and analyse the political and social lives of Black  and Third World women from a  feminist perspective.  "We made a conscious political  decision to distinguish between Black women and women of  colour," say the women of Sister Vision. "This is an important distinction because  Black women have had a particular historical experience in  the world: the experience of  slavery and its aftermath.  Israeli defender of  Palestinians to visit BC  Felicia Langer is a Holocaust  survivor and an Israeli Jew  who has long been active in  the defense of Palestinian  people's national and human  rights. She is the vice-president of the Israeli League for  Human and Civil Rights.  As an attorney, Langer began  her career defending Sephard-  ic Jewish workers arrested  for demonstrating. Her main-  work since 1967 has been with  Palestinian political prisoners who live in the occupied  West Bank and Gaza.  Felicia Langer will speak in  Vancouver on June 13, at  7:30 p.m. at Britannia Community Centre (above the  library). This is her first  Canadian engagement on a  North America-wide Speaking  tour. The tour is jointly  sponsored by the Toronto  Middle East Group (largely  professors) and the Palestine  Human Rights Committee (a  broadly based church and community organization)..  This is a rare opportunity for  people in Vancouver to hear an  Israeli Jew with her perspective speak about her first  hand experiences.  For more information  Chava Mintz 251-5419.

Women attending came from all  regions of the province, representing both colleges and  communities: college instructors, students, and support  staff, and women from women's  resource centres, immigrant  women's services, native  women's groups, and other  women's and educational community groups. The community  strategy sessions bought  these women together in regional caucuses and gave them the  opportunity to pool the information from Saturday's workshops and from teh speakers,  together with their own local  needs and resources, to develop  local and regional networks.  The results of these sessions  were extremely positive. Women  are already meeting in newly-  created networks in various  regions of the province. Long-  range proposals include making the conference an annual  event, creating an Equality  Information Officer position  within C-IEA, lobbying to  create Women's Advisory Committees at all the colleges and  to restore the Women's Access  Co-ordinators at all the  colleges.  The Status of Women Committee  of C-IEA will be issuing a  follow-up report on the conference, including networking  lists, summaries of the workshop material and summaries  of the strategy sessions.

Collective solutions to unemployment  A workshop for women to explore  the possibilities of a collective solution to unemployment  will be part of the conference  Making Sense of Change: Transition Between Economies presented by SPARC B.C. in June.  Workshop leaders will look  at the possibilities of cooperative businesses where  women are worker-owners, or  partners, or collective members, focussing on the issues  for women involved in co-opera  tive businesses, potential  problems, and components for  success.  Susan Wismer, co-author of  the book Community Profit will  be one of the main resource  people, with the local perspective provided by Carol Neilsen  and Melanie Conn.

Hepp vs. Catholics  A Prince George woman has form-  all commenced legal action  against the Amata Transition  House in Quesnel because of  recent constitutional changes  that ban women considering  abortions from shelter at" the  facility.  Gina Hepp of Quesnel, past  vice-president of the Transition House Society, is protesting amendments made to the Amata Constitution by a newly  elected Board of Directors  dominated by representatives ■  of the Catholic Women's League  ('Woman Fights Anti-Choice  Clause' Kinesis  Feb. '85). The  constitution was changed in  May of 1982 to include a clause  that reads in part, "to provide  shelter to pregnant teenagers  14 years and up who wish to  carry their babies to term.  And to accept and place certain  children, in exceptional cases,  as requested by Human Resources,  except in such cases where a  pregnant teenager is to have an  abortion"  (emphasis ours).  In October of 1983 a paragraph  was added to the constitution  that further entrenches the  board's anti-choice position  in the mandate of the shelter.  It reads, "that Amata Transi  tion House Society in the protecting of the lives and offering shelter to battered women  and their children and to  young females cannot accept  those women "and teenagers  considering  abortion. This  provision is unalterable."  (emphasis ours).  Hepp says that she has commenced  legal action for these two  reasons. First, she says she  has good reason to believe  that the Board of Directors of  the Society changed the constitution illegally; in that no  notice of the resolutions to  change the constitution was  given to or ratified by the  general membership. Second,  she believes that the changes,  insofar as they deal with the  issue of abortion, should be  beyond the scope and power of  the Society's founding constitution, and that they are contrary to public policy.  "The reason I have made the  decision to carry this legal  aci'ton through is that I believe that the founding constitution did not discriminate  against women in any way and  should remain so," says Hepp.  "Transition Houses are not the  place for the pros and cons of  abortion to be fought."  Readers concerned about Hepp's  fight can send donations to .  The Transition House Defense  Fund, Account #7600313, Bank  of Commerce, 318 Reid St.,  Quesnel, B.C. V2J 2M4. Any  excess funds from donations  will be sent ot the B.C. Society of Transtion Houses.  Women's Centres meet  by Maura Volante  The Secretary of State recently held a conference, May 3-5  at the Richmond Inn, for all  women's groups throughout B.C.  and the Yukon, that are funded  by their women's program.  Approximately 80 women attended the event, their expenses  covered by the Secretariat.  -Gail Meredith of V.S.W. was  impressed by the wide variety  of women represented at the  gathering, finding it interesting to note the differences  between the work of the city  groups and the centres in  rural areas. Specialization  is the key word for urban  feminist activists, whereas  the work is more general in  smaller centres, with family  and unemployment counselling  being part of the role of a  women's centre.  The schedule was packed with  events, starting with a dinner  and talk by Pauline Jewett  on Friday night and continuing with workshops all day  Saturday ('til 9:30 p.m.) and  half of Sunday. There were  workshops on feminist history  and philosophy, funding and  budgets, feminist humour',  married feminists, homophobia,  native women's issues, immigrant women and women's  centres, high school women's  issues, and more.  Though Gail thought that many  of the workshops were useful,  she found it difficult to do  the networking that such a  conference would seem to be an  opportunity to do. She suggested that this would have been  easier if on Friday night  women had been asked to  introduce themselves and their  group to the whole conference.  Also, the informal and one-to-  I one contacts would have been  facilitated by more free time  in the schedule.  Though in the final plenary  there was discussion of ways  to network among women's  groups, with the B.C. Federation of Women being recognized  but acknowledged to have not  entirely succeeded in that  aim, no definite conclusion  was reached on how to accomplish this task. A discussion  group will meet and prepare  an information packet on the  B.C.F.W. but any immediate  further action was stymied for  lack of funds.  Members of various offices of  the Secretary of State were on  Canadian women to hold sports conference  **jji\  Women from across the country  are converging on Vancouver in  June for the annual conference  of the Canadian Association for  the Advancement of Women and  Sport (CAAW&S). They are coming  from as far away as Cambridge  Bay, Northwest Territories and  Chebucto, New Brunswick. The  conference and annual general  meeting starts June 14 and runs  to June 16th at the Vancouver  School of Theology on the UBC  campus.  Friday night the keynote speaker is Grace Maclnnes, long-time  fighter for women's rights and  social activist. Saturday there  I will be a series of panels with  speakers from the sport, fitness  and women's health movements.  Topics include: Sport, Sex and  Gender, Sport and Gynaecology,  Body Image, Why Women Hate Sport  and several others. Saturday  there will also be a variety  of recreational activites with  a sesstion of entertainment in  the evening.  For more information call the  CAAW&S office at 662-3448.

Mediation  services  now offered  Free Mediation Services are now |  available at the Westcoast  Mediation Centre. Sessions are  being conducted in the False  Creek Community Centre. Here,  people can sit down in an  informal setting to work out  their disagreements within the  framework of a mediation session, aided by a neutral,  objective third party.  The mediator does not try to  judge disputes, but instead  sets fair ground rules, and  assists communication between  the parties. The mediator does  not offer 'pat' solutions, but  rather helps the people in  conflict Work together to find  a mutually agreeable solution  that they can both live with.  The Westcoast Mediation Centre  provides a service for people  when they need assistance in  resolving disagreements such  as: neighbourhood conflicts, .  sample family disagreements  (not including separation and  divorce issues), landlord-tenant disputes, consumer issues  and victim offender cases.

JULIA BRANDRETH (604) 224-7062 ACROSS CANADA  Women condemn media  Everyone is male unless identified otherwise.  This is an assumption indicated  by much of the language used  in the media. Women concerned  with this and other poor media  representation met this spring  at the University of Winnipeg.  The conference was designed to  establish contacts, develop  resources and promote positive  images of women in the media.  It was sponsored by Media Watch  Manitoba and the Manitoba  Action Committee on the Status  of Women.  Tanya Lester and Lydia Giles  were two of the conference  organizers. They came up with  the idea for the conference  while monitoring radio and  television stations in preparation for a workshop on sex  role stereotyping last fall.  Both women were surprised and  disappointed by the lack of  female representation.  "If the media is supposed to  reflect society then it clearly is not doing the kind of  job it should be doing by  limiting news coverage on half  .the people in our society,"  Lester says.  She says that women still are  not represented in their full  variety of ages, shapes, sizes  and colours.  "(Today) we want to connect  media women with over 30 women  who^ are active in many different women's issues," Lester  says. "By doing this, it is  hoped that these women will  be contacted and- interviewed  more often by the mainstream  media in the future."  Sherry Dangerfield conducted  a workshop on violence against  women. She outlined a series  of myths that encourage silence  and violence. She says that  these myths protect men and  isolate women.  "The courts and juries believe  these myths," she says. "The  media is responsible to anticipate and address these myths  in their stories."  Dangerfield says that violence  is directed at less powerful  people who cannot retaliate.  "You as media have power and  responsibility to women to  help stop this violence," she  says.  Charlynn Toews conducted a  workshop on images of women  in newspapers. "The indirect  Federal budget ignores promises  "The CACSW recognizes the necessity of reducing the deficit.  The difficulty lies in.carrying  out this reduction in a way  that will not penalize the most  vulnerable members of our society. At first glance it seems  this pitfall has not been  avoided," says Silvia Gold in.  response to the Progressive  Conservative Party's first federal budget, handed down in  May. Gold is president of the  Canadian Advisory Council on  the Status of Women.  "Many fundamental questions have  been raised," says Gold,"' and  the answers are not clear.  Some of these questions are:  •How can the government justify  a partial de-indexation of the  two most important social programs - family allowance and  old age security - that directly  affect mothers and older women  whose economic situation is  already very precarious ?  •With regard to job creation,  where are the precise measures  that require businesses to'-"use  their tax savings to invest in  human resources ? What are the  measures established to ensure  that businesses offer training  programmes that meet-the needs  of target groups in the work  force, including women ?  •Can women be assured that the  $900 million committed to job  training will actually result  in programs that fully integrate  women and lead to employment ?  •Since most- women have not access to employer sponsored pension plans, and therefore will  not receive any benefit from  the changes contained in the  budget, how will the government  fulfil its commitment to improve  pensions for women, whether  employed in the labour market  or working in the home ?  Finally, why has the government  gone through as extended process of consultation (with women's groups among others) if  their recommendations have not  been taken into consideration?"  concludes Gold. " We have the  right to ask what happened to  all the election promises about  day-care, battered women's  shelters, job creation, equal  pay for work of equal value and  better access to credit for female entrepreneurs ? We have  every reason to ask the government that question now."  role of the media influences  behavior," she says. "They  decide what is newsworthy."  Toews says that a content  analysis of Manitoba newspapers showed women often to be  either invisible or assumed.  Invisible when they were  totally left out of an article,  and assumed when no specific  mention was made of any women.  Instead, general words such  as "people" or "Canadians"  .were used.  The goal of the conference was  to help women- become more  visible, and to do so in a  positive manner.  Protection  for domestics  On April 1, 1985, domestic  workers in Ontario finally came  under the protection of the  Workers Compensation Act.  Any  domestic who works over 24  hours per week now has the  right to all,benefits and services offered to workers injured on the job.  These include payment for medical expenses and loss of wages,  vocational rehabilitation services, disability pension, and  death benefits for surviving  dependents.  Under the Workers Compensation  Act  employers of domestic  workers are required to register  with the Workers Compensation  Board and pay for the coverage  of their workers.  They are assessed by the Board  under Rate No. 907 and must  .pay $2.15 for every $100.00  of wages paid to the .domestic  worker. For example, an employer who pays the current Ontario  minimum wage of $757.00 would  be required to pay $16.00 per  If an employer fails to register with the Workers Compensation Board, the domestic worker is still protected by the  Act. She or he can report the  accident/illness to the Board  and it will investigate the  claim.  An employer who is not registered with the Board is liable  for the full cost of the claim  as well as any assessments due.  The International Coalition to  End Domestics' Exploitation  (INTERCEDE) began lobbying  for the inclusion of domestics  under the Workers Compensation•  Act  at their inception in  1979. In a recent CBC radio  interview, INTERCEDE co-ordinator Judith Ramirez said, "We  are cautiously optimistic, we  will be watching closely how  the Board handles claims by  domestics and whether it goes  after employers who do not  register."  Farm  women  to meet  "Farm Women: Networking for  Action" is the theme of the  Second National Farm Womens  Conference slated to be held  this year in Charlottetown,  . Prince Edward Island, November  21st through 24th.  Wanda MacMurdo, Planning  Committee Chairperson, explains  that while farm women have  made strides in bettering  their lot, much work remains  to be done. "It's time for  farm women from all parts of  Canada to assemble to demonstrate our motivation and find  new and creative ways to better  our situation within the farming industry. This Conference  will bring together women  from the grass roots of Canadian farming, and women's agricultural organizations," she  explains.  Mrs. MacMurdo notes that the  progress of farm women within  the fabric of Canadian society  had been slowed somewhat by  the difficult economic times  facing the farming industry  and that means there is still  much work to be done.  A planning committee representing farm women from across the  country is now putting the  finishing touches on the program for this year's Conference.

The Working Group submitted  a brief on pornography to the Fraser Committee in April 1984.  The report of the Special Committee on  Pornography and Prostitution (known as  the Fraser Committee) was released in April,  nearly two years after the committee had  begun its work. This report is clearly  aimed at trying to synthesize opposing  points of view, to reconcile fundamental  contradictions. It is a masterpiece of- compromise in which feminist views are canvassed but not taken to their logical conclusion.  The release was accompanied by a typical  media fanfare which was focussed on the  Committee's more obviously controversial  recommendations regarding prostitution.  Coverage included little dlsucssion on  the Committee's proposed "widesweeping  reforms to deal with pornography". The  Committee's recommendations that the federal and p rovinc ia1 gvo ernment s, •  should strengthen both their moral and  financial commitment to removing the  economic and social inequalities between  men and women and discrimination on the  basis of sexual preference.. . (and)  ensure that there are adequate social  programs to assist women and young people  in need.  were ignored altogether.  Although few people outside government  managed to get access to the report before  being asked to comment, the recommendations  on pornography seemed to meet with approval  from most quarters. Some even suggested  that the recommendations on pornography  were a victory for feminists. The Advisory  Council on the Status of Women praised the  Committee's recommendations, suggesting'that  the proposed Criminal Code sections paralleled the Council's own position.  Reading the full text of the report,  however, it is clear the Fraser Committee  steered away from adopting a feminist  analysis of pornography.  The report first sets out what the Commit.-  tee sees as the three basic positions on  the issue: the conservative (the state  has a duty to protect the moral welfare  of its citizens), the liberal (the state  should not interfere with individual liberty unless that activity in question  is proven to cause harm to others) and the  feminist (pornography is anti-woman propa-  USED & OLD"  BOOKS.  -8 0UG-WT <£ SOLD  ART  LITERATURE  HISTORY  CANADIAN* ■  VANCOUVER  '  PHONE 68I-76S4  Fraser  Committee  masterpiece  of compromise  The committee recognized there was not a  consensus within the women's movement  about the degree to which the state  should intervene, but said that the majority  of the submissions it received from women's  organizations argued in favour of extended  legal controls on pronography.  The Committee's reluctance to choose between these three starting points was a  major mistake. Its decision not  to try to  develop its own working definition of  pornography was fatal, instead it tried  to provide something for everyone and  succeeded in creating a tangled mess of  legislative proposals ranging from the  permissive to the repressive. (Lack of.  clarity is bound to be the result when  two years is spent discussing something  which you refuse to define).  While this refusal was probably due to  an effort to avoid taking sides in a long,  complicated debate (feminists are still  far from resolving the problem of definition), its absence has lead to a lack of  coherence hwihc runs throughout the report  Not surprisingly, the Committee, having  stated that it was not going to develop -  a definition, actually does make assumptions about what pornography is. These  assumptions are implicit in the body of  the 'report and are made explicit in their  recommendations for amendments to the  Criminal Code.  For example, the proposed new Section 159  (1) (c) defines "visual pornographic material) as including:  any matter or thing in or on which is  depicted vaginal, oral or anal intercourse, sexually violent behaviour,  bestiality, incest, necrophelia, masturbation, lewd touching of the breasts  ■ or the- genital parts of the body, or  the lewd exhibition of the genitals.  "Lewd", a quaint Victorian term, is not  defined. While it is important to note  that this definition only applies to the  section pertaining to materials in which  actual physical harm was caused to the  person or persons (that is, woman or women)  depicted, it is nevertheless a  definition.  Further, it is a definition which makes  the serious mistake of combining women-  hating materials with sexually explicit  materials, ignoring a distinction which  feminists tried to impress upon Committee  members.  Although the Committee praises the work  done by feminists on the issue of pornog-  Ot Selected Essays  llC-fl" on t'le History of  •111 Womefis Work  oney  i  mm  raphy, it states that it is not prepared  to accept that pornography is "a significant causal factor" in the commission of  sexual violence. It acknowledges that this  conclusion is contrary to arguments made  by many people who presented briefs,  but states that "the results of the research are contradictory and inconclusive".  The Committee was not prepared to accept  the information given by the many women  who work.with the women and children who  are victims of sexual violence. They are  waiting for the 'real experts' to provide  'proof .  Instead it concludes that there are two  "harm flowing from pornography,  The first is the offence which it  does to numbers of the public who are  involuntarily subjected to it.  The  second is the broader social harm which  it causes by undermining the right to  equality which is set out in Section  IS. of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  It suggests the first harm should be dealt  with by controlling and regulation, but  not prohibition. They argue that the  second harm "requires direct proscription  of certain.forms of pornography."  In defining these two kinds of 'harms'  the Fraser Committee has accepted that  there are materials which are all right  for 'private consumption'. This can be  interpreted either as a suggestion that  misogyny is O.K. at home .(the liberal  view) or that explicit sexuality belongs  behind closed doors (the conservative  view). Neither interpretation serves  women.  This distinction between public display  and private consumption is contained in  their recommendations for a new section  to the criminal code. These recommendations  include a three-tiered offence to replace  the present obscenity provisions.  Influenced by the new era of gender-  neutrality ushered in by the equality  provisions of the-Charter of Rights, the  suggested amendments make no mention of  the fact that it is women (and primarily  female children) who are actually physically, harmed, sexually assaulted, boound,  "lewdly" touched, etc. in pornography.  The first tier is aimed at prohibiting  materials in which the persons (women)  depicted are actually physically harmed.  While few people would find fault with  this aim, it will probably be very difficult to prove that the women were actually  harmed, given modern film techniques  and also given that 85% of the pornography  in Canada is imported form the U.S.A.  The second tier would absolutely prohibit  materials which depicted sexual assault.  It is also aimed at prohibiting depictions  of toher "sexually violent behaviour"  (including bondage, murder, assault and  self-infliction of physical harm) but  only where these are depcited "for the  apparent purpose of causing sexual gratification to or stimulation of the viewer".  The Commitee itself -recognizes that very  few convictions would result from a test  which requires that an intention to sexually stimulate be proved - the difficulties are obvious.  'The Committee recommends that someone  who sells, rents or displays materilas  which fall under the second tier, but which  are demonstrated to have a "genuine  educational or scientific purpose" or are  "work of artistic merit" should have a  defence.  The third tier is limited to the display,  in areas to which the public has access,  of "visual pornographic materilas". This  includes sexually explicit materials  (other than those prohibited by the first  Fraser Committee continued page 29 Kinesis June 1985 7  PEACE  Conference makes  important connections  by Maura Volante  Women's Alternatives for Negotiating Peace -  B.C.   & Yukon Regional Conference,  brought  together in Victoria from May 10 to 12 a  wide variety of women involved and interested  in the issues surrounding the idea of peace.  There were older women who have been writing  letters to governments for generations, women involved with direct action- such as the  Nanoose Bay Peace Camp and the Wollaston  Lake Uranium Blockade, and women who see  peace work as one of many ways to transform  this society from one of violence and alienation to one of co-operation and integration of all living beings.  Ursula Franklin, a professor of engineering at the University of Toronto and a long  time peace activist, shook up the audience  with her reasonable and logical explanations  of very radical ideas. "We must remind ourselves that the system does not work. It  does not work even for those for whom it  is designed to work"  Franklin advocated a return to a women's  world, one in'which "the interaction of  people, the interdependence and the co-operation is understood, practised and developed.1  She said that this women's world is not  meant to exclude all men, but that she uses  the term generically to include those who  "understand the values, have the skills and  subscribe to the priorities of that world;  and these are predominantly women."  Her speech was indicative of the kinds of  connections that were made at the conference: between patriarchy and war, between  economics and militarism, between exploitation of the Third World and the exploitation of women, and so on. This was encouraging, but there was still a noticeable  bias in the organization towards the middle  class white women's viewpoints. Mireya Lu-  cero, from AMES (the women's association of  El Salvador) was not given time at the plenary, but rather participated in a workshop  focussing on issues in the Third World.  Also, the participants were asked to choose  one workshop topic out of nine, and stay  with the same group all weekend, the argument "being that this was the best way to  get in-depth work done. What it also did  was to severely limit the time available  for participants to share information about  projects that they are involved with. There  was one  time slot late Saturday afternoon  during which one could view a slide show  on uranium mining in northern Saskatchewan  or  on the Nanoose Bay Peace Camp or  on AMES  or  join one of many other special interest  group discussions. I think that all of these  action-oriented groups deserved more space  in the timetable.  One of the highlights of the weekend was  the presentation on Saturday night of Red  Heart Theatre Collective's original work,  Power Play. The play deals with issues of  sex-role conditioning, violence against  women, environmental destruction, militarism, exploitation of the Third World, the  nuclear threat and homophobia.  nds de]  ig, and is at txmes very  heavy, but the group consisting of four  women and three men skilfully blends humour,  original music, energetic movement and,  especially towards the end, the elements  of human connection and co-operation, leading to a hopeful conclusion. I'm hopeful  that the collective will bring the play to  Vancouver. Don't miss it if they do!  The conference drew to a close on Sunday  afternoon, with resolutions brought to the  final plenary from each of the workshop  groups. These will be passed on to the  MNational Conference in Halifax in early  June. Though I found the conference sometimes rigid and controlled, I. was also impressed as I always am with the connections  we as women make when we gather together.  International group  to make uranium tour  An international delegation will tour |  nortnern Saskatchewan this summer in  commemoration of the 40th anniversary of  the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings.  The tour, which goes from July 25 to  August 11, is being organized to expose  the fact that the uranium industry in  Saskatchewan is entirely dependent on the  international market, and many countries'  reactors are dependent on Saskatchewan  uranium. The nuclear industry is an  international problem that it will take  international co-operation to solve.  Participants will begin with a tour of  Saskatoon 'hot spots' - company offices  and uranium transport routes - and will  go on to visit the mines themselves. They  will also attend the International Indigenous Youth Conference in Batoche. They  will have the opportunity to speak with  government and corporate officials, give  presentations at public meetings, and be  interviewed by the media.  Organizers say the tour is an effort to:  •support the native people of northern  Saskatchewan in their fight for self-determination and against uranium mining, and  •strengthen the international native rights/  anti-newkiller (sic) movement by spreading  information about the devastation of the  people and land that has already taken place  in Saskatchewan.  All interested people are invited to' participate, and are encouraged to bring audiovisual and written resources along.  In Europe the tour is being co-ordinated  by The People's Movement Against Nuclear  Power (FMK), Box 7067, 402 32 Gothenburg,  Sweden.

Many  UDF leaders were arrested, and  sixteen have been charged with,  high treason.  Albertina Sisulu, the co-president of the UDF, is amongst  those detained and charged.  As she is the only woman  charged, she is being held in  solitary confinement until  the trial begins.'  At sixty-six Albertina was a  leading member of the ANC  Women's League in the 1950's.  Her husband was sentenced to  life imprisonment with Nelson  Mandela more than 20 years  ago. For 17 years she was  banned and some of her children have spent long periods  in detention in South Africa.  Yet her commitment to the  apartheid struggle has never  wavered.  ti-  Thousands expected  at Nairobi UN forum  by Emma Kivisild  Thousands of women are expected to go to Nairobi this  summer to assess the achievements of the past decade -  the UN Decade for Women - and  make plans for the future of  women's liberation around the  world.  Attendance estimates for the  UN Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) Forum July 10th  to 19th range from 5,000 to  8,000. Hundreds of workshops  will be the focus of the ten  day event, and other, simultaneous, activities include  an international film forum  and field trips to women's  projects outside Nairobi.  Canadian delegates to the  forum number about 100,  from a variety of groups.  Some of the organizations  with representation from B.C.  are the Congress of Canadian  Women, the YWCA, the National Council .of Jewish Women,  B.C. Immigrant Task Force,  Canada World Youth, Vancouver  Co-operative Radio, and the  Vancouver Status of Women/  Kinesis  and W.A.V.A.W./Rape  Crisis Centre.  The governmental conference  which overlaps with the NGO  gathering will be going  ahead." There was some concern  earlier this year that it  would not proceed as planned  when preliminary negotiations  on the conference's central  document broke down.  Louise Holmes of Status of  Women Canada told Vancouver  women at a pre-Nairobi  meeting in late May that a  rough draft of a Forward  Looking Strategy for women  has been prepared by the UN.  This paper, about 300 paragraphs long, will be the main  agenda item for the governmental representatives, and  needed to be two-thirds  approved in international  preparatory meetings in order  to be presented. This seemed  impossible after a controversial meeting with the USSR  and the USA in Vienna in  February, but a special  meeting in New York last  month saw the requisite number of paragraphs approved  by all sides.  This Forward Looking Strategy  is a parallel document to  the Plan of Action approved  in Mexico City in 1975 and  the Programme of Action  approved in Copenhagen in  1980. Neither of these documents had the support of the  Canadian or US delegations  because of what some people  have referred to as 'extrane-'  ous political issues.' The  Mexico and Copenhagen papers  drew parallels between Zionism, racism and imperialism,  and recognized the PLO as the  official representative of  the Palestinian people.  Controversy over whether  other liberation struggles  are or are not inextricably  linked to women's liberation  will probably play a large  role at this year's meetings  as well - on both NGO and  government levels.  The themes of both events are  'Equality, Development and  Peace', with sub-themes of  'Employment, Health and Edu-  Just before her detention Mrs.  Sisulu told the press that her  husband had rejected Mr.  Botha's offer of release if  they were to denounce the ANC's  commitment to armed struggle.  "Quite simply" she said, "they  don't want any condition  attached to their release".  At the end of last year on  behalf of the UDF she issued  a forthright condemnation of  apartheid:  "Events throughout the Transvaal and other parts of the  country have reached tragic  proportions. More than 1000  oppressed people have been  killed by the brutal forces of  apartheid. More than 200 people are currently in detention  without trial. 6500-workers  have been dismissed and the  education structure has  collapsed with tens of thousands of Black scholars facing  a bleak and uncertain future.  The full might of the SA Defence Force has been mobilised  in order to intimidate and  frighten.residents into submission. The root cause of the  suffering is the evil system  of apartheid, which our people  have decided to challenge and  destroy."  The regime has responded by  curtailing her freedom and  preventing her participation  in the UDF which is striving  for the peaceful establishment  of democracy in South Africa.  The national Executive of the  UDF has issued a statement  pointing out that there can  be no fair and just trial for  the detained UDF leaders in  South Africa and further that  "the present South African  government, with its undemo- ■  cratic origins and orientations has no legitimate right  to put on trial and pass  judgement on our leaders".  The trial was condemned by a  unanimous resolution of the  Security Council in the UN  on the 12th of March.  The details of charges are  not known yet, and the  trials started in late May. It  should be noted, however,  that charges of "high treason"  entail capital punishment.  • Please send messages of support to the: Sisulu Family,  7372 Orlando West, P.O.

(Sparg Rib)  Epidemic  strikes  women  of Bhopal  There is strong evidence to  suggest that the Bhopal gas  leak disaster has caused an  epidemic of gynaecological  diseases.  So far, any effect on women's  health has been judged in  terms of pregnancies alone.  But a recent study in field  clinics in the gas affected  slums revealed an extremely  high proportion of gynaecological diseases. Of the women  examined, 94% had leucorrhea  (a white vaginal discharge),  79% had Pelvic Inflammatory  Disease, and excessive  .menstrual bleeding was found  in 46% (with possible consequent severe anaemia, reduced  working capacity and aggravated respiratory problems).  Other effects noted were  suppression of lactation (which  could lead to malnutrition in  the infants of these women),  impotence in husbands,  still births and abortions.  What was found is probably  'only the tip of an iceberg.  Medical relief so far has  been through polyclinics and  hospitals - the crowded facili-  dis  fn  attending, and they have complained that doctors are not  paying attention to their  symptons and not carrying out  gynaecological examinations.  Some gynaecologists have dismissed the findings, saying  that these diseases, are due  to poverty and poor hygiene.  It is clear that a research  project needs to be set up  immediately; but also there is  a strong need for more field  clinics and training of women  paramedics; and for women's  organisations to bring pressure to bear on the authorities  to implement full scale treatment and investigation of the  sidious problems caused by  thi:  gas  Further information from: Dr.  Rani Bang,   Wardha 2563 P.O.

Broadsheet Kinesis June 1985 9  INTERNATIONAL  Zimbabwe Women  Finding  time to act  by Dominique Clerk  "My husband and I work in the same factory.  But when we go home together in the evening, he takes a seat and listens to. the  radio and I begin my second job."  This testimony of a woman employed in an  electrical factory doesn't seem that different from the ones of women working in  developed countries. Since Independence in  1980, women have had great expectations  that the newly elected government would  bring reforms to the women's working conditions. So far, only men have been promoted  and women are still prevented from voicing  their concerns in the factory.  Although Zimbabwe women represent 51% of  the population, they contribute only 6.8%  of the entire labour force in the non-agricultural sector. The male migrant labour  system, which has forced men to move from  rural areas to work in factories and mines,  can partly explain this small representation of women. The majority of women are  left in the impoverished Tribal Trust Lands  where they are engaged in subsistence agriculture. Even if Zimbabwe's Independence  has led to an increase in the number of  women workers in the modern sector of the  economy, a growing proportion of the poorest urban households now consist of these  newly urbanized women.  Zimbabwean women workers are generally  classified as unskilled or semi-skilled  labour and are employed mainly m the  food, clothing, and textile industries.  These sectors represent an extension of  the domestic role of women in society.  Since managers consider that "a woman's  touch is swift, and gentle," and that  "women have nimble fingers," they are concentrated in positions such as hand-stitching, hand assembling and hand-sorting.  No job rotation exists so that the majority  of women are locked into tedious jobs,  seated in the same position, performing  the same task, eight hours a day, five or  six days a week. Sitting still on benches  without a good support and performing  monotonous movements often produces severe  backaches. In order to make time, pass faster, and to forget about their pains, these  women sometimes sing.  Child-bearing and child-rearing functions  are burdens carried solely by women. Very  little support from men or institutions  in society is provided for the care of  children and households. Usually factories  do not maintain childcare services, healthcare facilities or other facilities which  would release them from such a load.  As a result of the lack of these services,  women need to employ domestic help or to  send their children to daycare using their  own wages or to leave their younger children with their mothers in the rural areas.  Despite the fact that most industrial  agreements state that a woman is allowed  three months of maternity leave, the govern-^  ment has failed to grant women employed in  industry the right to paid maternity leave.  Employers are reluctant to train women  since they often leave or miss their work  to bear children or are frequently away  from work taking care of a sick child.  According to the Labour Law, breastfeeding  should account for two daily half-hour  periods. Unfortunately, this law is not  always respected by some factories' employers where women only get five minutes to  breastfeed per day.  nditioi  An improvement in the working j  pregnant women is also not taken into  consideration. On one occasion, the  authors of the book Zimbabwean Women in  Industry,   (Patricia Made and Birgitta  Lagerstrom) observed a pregnant woman working all day in a room in a paint factory  of  where they only managed to stay for a few  minutes because of the suffocating vapours.  Women are vulnerable to male supervisors  since they are in insecure and often  casual positions: If sexual favours are  not granted, the supervisors threaten women  with dismissal. "When a woman refuses the  supervisor's advances, she stands little  chance in the factory. The supervisor will  either give a bad report to management  about you of will ill-treat you in the  workplace", said one .woman.  When seeking casual employment, women are  often bluntly told by male supervisors  that jobs are only available to those willing to provide favours. Relying on more  women supervisors and talking about this  Lunchroom at the bag depot, Grain Marketing Board,  outside of Harare.  problem among women might provide a way  of dealing with sexual harassment. However,,  the first steps to overcoming this problem  would be for women to learn about their  rights and not be afraid of insisting that  they should be respected.  Women are generally found at the bottom  of the industrial scale and usually earn  far less than the minimum Wage of $115  a month. They manage to make ends meet  through participating in the informal  sector. By selling items which they have  knitted, and by growing and selling  vegetables, they have an additional  though uncertain source of income.  In order to alleviate women's permanent  state of poverty, management must increase  their salaries. Given women's vulnerability  in industry, demand for higher wages is  likely to backfire. According to a woman  who works in the food industry: "If we  ask for more money, management will retrench, close down or cut the number of  workdays."  The majority of Zimbabwe women working in  the industry only have a primary school  education, which has locked them into unskilled positions. While men usually  receive vocational training that can promote them to higher grades or skilled  positions, employers continue to believe  that women are incapable of being trained  to look after new and complex machinery.  In order to allow women to become more  than a cheap and unskilled reserve class  of workers, trade unions and industry,, in  conjunction with the Zimbabwe government,  must provide incentives, opportunities  and support to facilitate women's access  to training opportunities.  It is true that the actual financial state  of several industries means they cannot  afford an increase in women's wages, the  provision of paid maternity leave or the  introduction of adult literacy classes  in the workplace. Many people feel, however, that the Zimbabwe government should  readjust its policies in order to favour  a domestically-oriented manufacturing industrial base. They say that the present  export-oriented strategy seems to increase  import dependence to the detriment of  developing and upgrading domestic industrialization. Although a domestic policy  can be costly in the short run, it represents a viable way to improve the standard  of living of its workers.  When a woman refuses the  supervisor's advances, she  stands little chance in the factory  The emergence of trade unions is another  way for women workers to improve their  working conditions on issues such as wages,  promotion, paid maternity leave and sexual  harassment.  However, most of the already existing  trade unions are not fully utilized by  Zimbabwean women. Although women generally  belong to such organizations, their formal  participation is low.  The major reason for their lack of attendance at union meetings lies in performing  time-consuming home chores after their  daily work in the factory. The workday  for most of these women often begins before  dawn (six a.m.) and ends after midnight.  In addition, women's availability for  meetings after work is further limited  if they have to walk, cycle or catch unreliable public transport to and from  meetings generally located several kilometers away. Even if union meetings are  held on Saturday mornings, women find it  difficult to attend them because of other  tasks which they have relegated to accomplish during weekends such as hand washing  clothes (washing machines are not available  within the range of the working class  income), cleaning and shopping.  Women's attitudes towards meetings also  impede attendance. Said one woman: "We  don't understand what's going on at the  meetings." Single women often prefer spending their time in various other forms of  entertainment. And when women do attend  meetings, they are reluctant to speak  out and also shy to express their concerns.  Women's own lack of confidence has delayed  progress towards change. As a result of  ignorance of laws of a union's legal power,  they fail to get involved in union work.

An EPZ is an area where international corporations, under foreign or local management, can set up factories. They are offered tax exemptions and exemptions from import and export controls for up to five  years, favourable investment and trade  case of Leila is typical. Leila is 23 years  old and.comes from Matara, a town on the  sourthern coast of Sri Lanka about 100  miles from the KEPZ. She comes from a  family of eight and tries to send money  home each month.  Leila was recruited to work in the factory  through a friend of the family and thus  feels an additional responsibility to keep  her job.

The labour code  of the country is not applicable within  the EPZ. As well, the host country provides  free electricity and water rights.  Separated from the surrounding environment  by fences and guards, the EPZ in Sri Lanka  resembles a Prisoner of War camp.  Sri Lanka entered the network of third  world EPZs in 1978 by establishing the  Kanatakuyae Investment Production Zone  (KEPZ). The EPZ is under-the direction  of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission.  Sixty percent of the factories in the EPZ  are garment factories where garments are  manufactured for export only.  Sri Lanka's garment industry was set up  on the advice of the World Bank with a 20  million dollar World Bank Loan. It survives  by subcontracting to major first world  firms and while it and other EPZ industries  provide some jobs, the economic advantages  are limited. The net domestic value  added in most EPZ industries is estimated  not to exceed 20%; that is,. Sri Lanka-  receives no more than 20% of the profits.  The benefits to Sri Lanka are further  diminished by the cost of such infrastructures as electricity, water,, fences, and  Women make up 86.3% of the labour in the  Sri Lanka. EPZ. They are chosen because of  their economic weakness and social subordination. They are generally very voun^as \ -  between the ages of 18 and 26. For most,  the factory work in the EPZ is their first  job. Eighty-eight percent are unmarried;  management recruits single women and  discourages workers from marrying. On the,  average they come from large fami]ies ,  in rural areas and send money home to  contribute to the family incomes.   > ,  ''ill  The work in the EPZs perpetuates a situation in which women are looked upon as  low-status commodities. A Malaysian free  trade zone brochure blurb advertises its  female labour in the following manner:  The manual dexterity of the oriental  female is famous the world over.  Her  hands are small and she works fast with  'extreme care...Who,  therefore,  could be  better qualified by nature and inheritance,  to contribute to the efficiency  'ñ†of a bench-assembly production line than  the oriental girl?  Having thus advertised the docile female,  the host government is obliged to create  and sustain socio-political structures  and conditions that ensure she remain as  docile as in the brochure.  Women in the KEPZ suffer many difficulties  in their housing and work situations. The  in the EPZ have obtained this level of  education) she was unable to find a job  in her home town area and was, therefore,  forced to seek employment further afield.  To work in a factory and to be boarded away  from home is looked on with disparagement  by many people in Leila's village. Part of  this hostility, Leila says, is the result  of the belief that any young woman living  on her own is leading a permissive sex  life. Leila says this image is unfounded  and once she started sending money home  her parents objected much less to her  living away from the family and working  in a factory.  Leila has been working for the past three,  years. She told me that she misses her  family a lot but is only able to go home  three or four times a year because of  the cost and also the lack of time off.  She does not like to come and work here  but must becauge^lJ^^ji^&onomic situation.  I interviewed Leila. Id 'tier boarding house  room, which she shares with three other '  women factory workers. Leila's boarding  situation is somewhat better than average,  as there are only three women sharing a  5x8 foot room as opposed to the usual  6-8 per room.  The room was very sparsely furnished. In  fact, the only pieces of furniture were  the straw sleeping mats that lay rolled  up on the grey cement floor. In one  corner of the room they kept their suit  cases (with all their possessions), a few  pots and pans, and some firewood for cooking.  Leila had invited me to visit her in her  room but said she could not offer me  anything because they were only poor workers. The women were, however, quick to go  to the neighbour and borrow a chair for  me, although I preferred to sit on the  floor with everyone else. This was typical  of the wonderful hospitality I received.  In Sri Lanka, as opposed to other countries  with EPZs, the factories do not provide  dormitories. The village where Leila lives,  Ekala, is just outside the factory zone  that surrounds the EPZ. The village caters  tjb the women whose permament residences  are beyond daily commutable distances  (this includes over 40% of the women workers) .  The majority of the boarding house owners  attempt to provide board and lodging far  beyond the capacity and facility of their  houses. The workers, therefore, are subject  to very poor living conditions and the  owners.are gaining great profits. Leila  explained to me that she spent over sixty  percent of her meagre salary on room and  board.  Leila and her roommates cook their own  meals, as do 58% of the women in boarding  homes. The kitchen, a dark, unlit, room,  consists of a grinding stone and two  stone stoves - no table or chairs. In the  early morning Leila cooks her meal of rice  and curry. Because of the lack of space,  it is necessary to cook in shifts. Leila,  for example, has to rise at 5a.m. to cook  her meal. She rarely shares cooking with  the others because they work different  shifts and their shifts are changed quite  regularly.  Leila has a small breakfast, packs part of  the meal for her lunch break at work and  stores the remainder for when she returns  from work in the afternoon .or late evening,  depending upon which shift she is working.  She told me that many of her sister  jkworkers suffer from frequent stomach  t'-ailmen-ts because they try to keep their  7~fcod for up to twenty-four hours without  the lu :urv of a refrigerator.  Some boarding homes I visited had no electricity; they were dimly lit with oil lamps  and candies. This is somewhat ironic  since the gaj tories right next door seem  |i|itJflfeve no lack of electrical power! Leila,  'j.jyfKteyer, feels she is fortunate because  she lives in a house with electricity.  Leila's factory, the Polytex Garment Factory, is just outside the EPZ and,, therefore, has marginally better conditions  than those factories within the zone.  Leila works six days a week, eight hours  per day, but if the factory has a large  order to fill, she and the others must  work double shifts with no break, for  which they are paid time and half. The  women in the Polytex Garment Factory  work a shift of either 6 am to 2 pm or 2 to  10 pm.  During her shift each worker has a pro- .  duction quota to meet. If the quota is not  met they must stay for unpaid overtime to  finish it or do it the next day, plus that  day's quota. The workers are given a half  hour lunch break, a fifteen minute tea  break and a five minute toilet break. At  other times permission must be granted to INTERNATIONAL  Kinesis June 1985 11  go to the. toilet. Leila said that they are  given free tea but no sugar and "...of  course everyone in Sri Lanka drinks tea  with sugar."  The average wage in the factory is 22  rupees per day (the equivalent of one  Canadian dollar). EPZ workers in Sri Lanka  are paid the least of any EPZ workers in  the world. The women are given 14 days  paid leave per year but they are not  allowed to take more than 3-4 days at once,  making trips home difficult. As well,  there is a seven day sick leave. This,  however, applies only to permanent workers  and many women are employed on a temporary  basis for long periods of"time and, therefore, do not receive these benefits.  The strike was also-difficult because Sri  Lanka is currently under emergency law.  due to the Sinhalese/Tamil ethnic conflict.  Public meetings of more than five people  are illegal; thus union meetings are very  difficult to organize.  Since Leila began organizing women workers  she has been under pressure in her factory.  She told me some of her difficulties:  We were working our regular shift when  it was announced over the loudspeaker  that two women, who were not union  members,  had been chosen to be line  supervisors because of their hard work  and dedication to the company. Announcing a promotion over the loudspeaker is  highly unusual.  As the two women walked  Many suffer from  pulmonary TE and  other respiratory  ailments.  Fifty-five percent of the women report  that their health has deteriorated since  starting work in the factories. Many  suffer from laryngitis, pulmonary TB and  other respiratory ailments which result  from being exposed to tiny textile particles and dust while cutting cloth with a  fast guillotine-like machine. They also  suffer from chronic ailments such as eye  strain and pains in the joints, knees,  shoulder and spine.  When I visited the floor of a garment  factory I understood how eye strain could  result from the bright, flickering, fluorescent lighting. Ventilation was also poor  and the noise level from the machines was  very high, and none of the workers wore  ear protection. Since there is only one  nurse for 2,400 workers, proper medical  treatment is impossible. As you can see  from the case of Leila the conditions are  far from ideal.  Leila also took me aside to tell me that  sexual harassment is a problem in some of  the factories. Foremen sometimes attempt  to extort sexual favours, using such  threats as shift changes, demotion, and  loss of job. The factories do not supply  bus services or adequate lighting outside  the factory gates, and women who work the  afternoon shift, which ends at 10 pm., have  to wait a long time for public buses, often  at dimly lit or unlit stops.  In the face of management opposition women  are working to organize the factory workers.  It is a difficult task because unions are  forbidden within the EPZ. However, in the  factories surrounding the EPZ some progress  has been made.  From- February to June of 1984, Leila participated, along with 1,200 other workers,  in a strike at the Polytex Garment Factory.  The workers demanded the granting of three  days casual leave with pay in addition  to the normal 14 days, an improvement in  medical facilities, and the reinstatement  of six workers who were unjustly fired.  The strike was successful, although success  was achieved only through a hard fought  battle which resulted in the arrest of  several women. :*p^,'&Civ.  toward the office they were saying to  everyone - 'see what happens if you do  not belong to that horrible union. ' A  spontaneous jeer broke out amongst the  women workers.  Myself and two other active union members were immediately taken aside and  told we were to. be suspended from work  without pay for two days for insubordinate behaviour and that we would have to  appear before the management council  without legal representation.  I was  amazed how only the three of us were  picked out.   We found out later that  there was a Chinese man from Hong Kong  who had been hired by the factory as an  expert in union busting.  Recently I received a letter from Sri  Lanka informing me that two of these  women had been fired because they had  allegedly hooted at members of the manage-  The few union branches that have been  established in the factories remain  only with great difficulty. Most workers  in the EPZ are too frightened to ever  discuss the question of unions, let alone  form a trade union themselves. This fear  is quite realistic, as they have been  told in no uncertain terms that they will  be sacked if they join a trade union.  In a country with an extremely high level  of unemployment, dismissal would mean  economic disaster. This fear hinders  organizations that seek to organize in the  EPZ, at least initially.  Such fears are alleviated somewhat by  contact with trade union activities and  news of struggles such as the successful  Polytex strike. When I visited the boarding homes with Leila, I found a surprising number of young women who had bought  the trade union paper from her, indicating that the union is becoming.quite  popular.  Union activities, however, have not been  the only form of protest. Spontaneous  and unorganized work stoppages are becoming more common. They are often sparked and centred around an immediate provocative incident or issue, an indication  that workers are beginning to question  the oppressive work system.  A Women's Centre, located at Ja-Ela,  near the EPZ, is working to organize  training workshops, and also works, as a  base for organization. The Women's Centre  tries to reach women both inside and  outside the EPZ, workers and non-workers  alike. But getting the women involved  is difficult because they have only one  day off per week and they need the rest.  Transportation is another problem. The  poor bus service often makes meetings  impossible to get to.  Although the young women who work in the  EPZ are subject to a new and perhaps  more acute oppression than women in the  domestic and agrarian systems of production,  they have nevertheless advanced into"the  workforce. The role of young women as  wage earners is significant if it increases  their awareness of oppression.  Some of the union activities I saw in  Sri Lanka illustrated the advance women  workers have made through union organization. The Industrial Transport, and General  Workers Union, which organizes factory  workers, and whose membership is 60% women,  has three women on its six member executive committee. The Vice President is  also a woman. On the other hand I visited  unions which had a high proportion of female membership but no women in the executive at all. Unions must realize that  women must be represented in the executive.  In viewing the case of Sri Lanka one can  draw the conclusion that the advent of  production lines in the EPZs has not  greatly improved the condition of women  workers. The problems they face, however,  are not caused solely by the companies  in the EPZ. Societal tradition and existing biased legislation strongly prohibit  the liberation of women. The situation  in the EPZ reflects the existing inequality and exploitation of women and workers  as a whole.  New technology can, nonetheless, be used  as a tool for the liberation of humanity.  Certain steps must be taken in that direction: women workers must be provided with  the right to information; appropriate  research and documentation must be carried out; and women and men, must be liberated from set female/male roles. The women  of Sri Lanka are beginning to make steps  in these directions. The struggle that  lies ahead for women such as Leila is  all important for third world feminism.  We in the west must make links with these  women to promote action for change.  Credit to the Voice of Women Survey:  Women Workers in The Free Trade Zone of  Sri Lanka,  July 1983.

Women in  pornography are just, a piece of mean, ass,  cunt. The enemy in militarism is a gook,  kraut, commie, subversive, etc.  There is much that pornography and militarism have in common. They both:  •are male institutions  •desensitize people to violence in order  to make violence more palatable  •require the domination of women  •use workers who are easily exploited  •equate male virility/sexuality with  aggression and domination  •condone, glorify and legitimize violence.  by Beryl Clayton  ■ The following article is taken from the  script of a workshop on pornography and  militarism.  By pornography, I mean:  written or pictorial material which:  •depicts sex in a violent, humiliating 01  degrading context in such a way as to  condone degradation,  •degrades women and children for the purpose of entertainment or to sell products.  By militarism, I mean:  •organised use, or threatened use, of  force by a group of people to maintain  control or domination, usually enforced  by an institutionalised build up of weapons,  •the glorification of military ideals and  the predominance of the military in the  administration and policy of the state.  Pornography is a symptom of a much larger .  problem and would not exist without certain  conditions in our society. It is not a  new issue for women to be concerned with,  but the scale has increased dramatically  in the last few years, probably in part  as a threatened response to feminism and  women asserting their own sense of self.  It is also much more frightening because  of its increased availability, accelerated  by technology and a consumer society  which ahs made pornography a multi-billion  dollar industry that is widely available,  especially with the introduciton of videos.  It has also become increasingly violent -  even "mainstream" movies: in 1982, 1 in 20  commercially released films depicted violent acts against women; in 1983 it was 1  in 8.  Increased military spending and t*he threat  of nuclear war has also made militarism  an even more urgent issue for women to  challenge. The threat is bigger than ever,  but it is also not new. It is based on  and maintained by attitudes which have  been around for a long time.  The overall framework under which I am  looking at pornography and militarism is  one of domination: the idea that unequal  power relationships are inevitable and that  it is acceptable for one group of people  to dominate another.  In order for our system to .work,  very  few people can actually hold positions of  real power.  Therefore, many pieople,  particularly men as the burden of this  type of power has traditionally been  theirs, feel unsuccessful and powerless'.  There are many outlets for this frustration.   One outlet is to target some group  of people over which to feel powerful.  Both pornography and the military provide such an outlet.  An integral part of this framework is the  use of force - whether actual or threatened,  whether in pornographic images of women  being tortured, or in the "deterrent" of  nuclear weapons. This use of force is  Women's.domination is intricately linked  to both these institutions. In pornography  this is obvious. Pornographers package  women for male consumption. Throughout  pornography we find images of women being  raped, then loving their rapist, of women  tied and gagged and appearing altogether  As women who do not wish the  lie of male power and superiority  to be spread farther, we must  fight the concept of a military  state in all its forms.  submissive to their "master". Clearly this  reinforces men's desire to dominate women.  But the military also thrives on female  domination. One need only look at the  rate of rape by men against "enemy" women  in all recorded warfare to realize that  militarism is directly related to violence  against and domination of women. Reports  from Vietnam showed entire villages  where every single woman was brutally  raped and often tortured by American  soldiers.  Military leadership has done little to  stop this behaviour. In a discussion with  an ex-Marine on his experience at boot-  camp, he said that the men would exercise  to chants such as, "If I die on the  Russion front, bury me with a Russian  cunt". He claimed that periodically  leaflets would be distributed to the soldiers asking them not to rape. It is easy  to see why they were disregarded, since  after they were received the men would  go on jogging to chants such as the one  above.  On the boat to Vietnam, GIs were told:  "There's lots of loose ass over there  men, and they just love GI dick. And best  of all, they're Gooks, so if you get tired  of them, you can cram a grenade up their  cunt and waste them." This is borne out  in the story told by one soldier after  raiding a village in Vietnam.2  But I was still pissed off at these  people,  they were almost fighting us  and I heard the sergeants yelling,  "Vietcong bastards! You little mother-  fucking commie gooks!" - I pictured  them as the enemy.  Finally,  things started calming down  after about two hours of this bullshit,  laying people on the ground,  standing  on their backs,  slapping them around.  Things calmed down, and me and one of.  the buck sergeants and two other guys  took these four chicks in the elephant  grass outside the perimeter,  and we  were all fooling around.  We balled these chicks.   They were forcibly willing - they'd rather do that  than get shot.   Then one of the girls .  yelled some derogatory thing at the  guy who 'd blled her,  in Vietnamese,  but he knew what it meant.  Re just  reached down for his weapon and blew  her away.  Well,  right away,  the other three guys  who were there,  including myslef, picked  up our weapons and blwe away the other  three chicks. Just like that.  It was  just a spontaneous,  instantaneous type  thing.  The first word that entered my mind was  murder.  I thought I was going to get  in trouble for it,  but I didn't.  Why is it necessary for the military to  degrade women to achieve their goals?  One answer might be that the military  requires men to demonstrate their most  conventionally "male" characteristics,  those of the macho, tough, dominant  personality. The domination of women is  inseparable from this particular personality. The side of men that leads them  to dominate the enemy.  The way that male virility is equated  with domination in militarism is also  reflected in the language of the militarists. After Johnson ordered North Vietnam  boat bases and oil depots bombed, he  bragged to a reporter: "I not only  screwed Ho Chi Min, I cut his pecker off".  In 1977 Kissenger told Congress the U.S.  Kinesis June 1985 13  art of otherness  would be emasculating itself by not providing military funds to Angola.  The myth is that the army will make a man  out of you. The reality is the relinquishing of moral responsibility and personal  autonomy by learning subservience to higher levels of male authority and learning  to kill on command. The process of becoming  real men includes being programmed with  misogynist, racist, homophobic attitudes  and includes having easy access to pornography and prostitutes.  This programming breaks down the remaining  traces of natural empathy with others and  refines the ability to objectify the enemy.  An inevitable outcome of this mentality  is the large scale casual destruction of  life in war, and the rape of women and  girls* WlSm  In order for the young man to be a good  soldier,  he must "kill the woman in him".  He can't feel compassion for the people  he must kill.  He must learn to despise  "womanly" qualities.  What better thing  for the military than-to train him to  have contempt for women? To the military  mind women are divided into^two distinct  categories: those at home who need to  be defended, and those who are the spoils  of war.  Women in an enemy country are  property of the enemy.  How better to  show your power over the enemy than to  brutally rape and torture their women?  Another side of this thinking is reflected  in what Doug Collins said about Media  Watch women. He said that he hoped they'd  be on the front lines to be raped by the  Russians. When we speak out against violence against women we are no longer  worthy of protection, it would seem.  I also see (this as an example of how the  women's movement can fail to make the  connections between violence against  women and militarism. I think it no accident that Collins used this image to show  his contempt for feminists. It was a direct  militaristic threat. As he saw it, what  those women deserved was to be dominated,  abused, because he saw them as the enemy,  no longer human.  The enemy becomes gooks, slants  or whatever racial term applies.  Like women in pornography,  they're also not human.  There are ways in which pornography and  militarism directly use each other to  reinforce this equation of male virility  with aggression and to further men's de-  sensitization to violence. Pornography is  distributed to soldiers before and after  battle. Mother Jones  carried a picture  of a U.S. soldier in Grenada in combat  clothes, grinning and holding up a centrefold. Pornographic videos were shown to  British soldiers on the way to the Faulk-  lands. I am sure this is common, there are  not isolated events. The Nazis plastered  violent pornographic posters on the streets  in places they controlled - to desensitize  people to degradation.  Visualize two pictures.  In the first, a cartoon, a man and a  woman stand on a sidewalk. He is thin  and wears a yarmulke. She is fat and  carries a picketbook wit a large lock  on it. Behind the couple, in the background, is a Jewish ghetto. Running on  the sidewalk,  toward the foreground of  the picture, is an angular little girl.  Like the man and woman,  she has a  grotesquely exaggerated nose. She is  chasing a dollar bill attached to a  string pulled by a man crouched behind  a building.  The man wears a swastika on  his right arm and raises a baseball bat  over his head with the left one.  In the second picture, a naked woman leans  back against a draped counter.  Her pelvis  is thrust forward and her arms are behind  her back as though her wrists were tied.  Her legs are slightly spread.  Her posture  suggest helplessness, submission and  sexual desire.  She looks at the viewer  seductively.  Her face is devoid of emotion or intelligence.  Circling her leg,  penetrating her things, and coiling behind her is a gleaming, monstrous python.  The first picture is a cartoon from  Hustler. The second is a typical painting  by Franz von Stuck, Adolf Hitler's  favorite artist.  It is not mere coinci-  L.  wealth, race, sex, culture, sexual preference, age, etc. The practice of  creating 'others' extends even to nature  itself. If we think about how those -in  power relate to nature and the earth, we  can see that it is based on objectifying,  controlling, possessing and exploiting -  giving rise to the expression 'rape of  the earth.'  To sum up, we can see that pornography  and militarism both have as one essential  ingredient the domination of women. We  see that pornography is warfare between  men and women. Both institutions have a  strong male leadership that exploits its  employees to gain more money and power  for itself. Both desensitize men to violence. And both rely, and perpetuate, an  equation of male virility with aggression  and domination.  As women who do not wish the lied of male  power and superiority to be spread farther,  we must fight the concept of a military  state in all its forms. As feminists we  must fight not only the anti-woman violence in pornography and media, but other  forms of male violence that directly  impact on our lives and the,lives of all  people, and which threaten to destroy the  earth itself.  2 From The New Exiles,  by Roger Neville  Williams", Liverwright Publishers, New York,  1977, pp 271-272.  3 Dorchen Leidholt, 'Where Pornography  meets Fascism' from WIN,  March 15, 1983.  dence.  Indeed,  the collective mind of  the pornographers and that of the  Nazis reveal such pronounced ideological  similarities and operate in such  strikingly similar ways that one must  conclude ultimately that they are the  same.'S   -  Dorchen Leidholt  Pornography also often uses direct military  images - bullets, guns, uniforms. A  section of a film shown in Not A Love  Story  shows a woman being forced to  perform fellatio on a gun. And images  which glorify male superiority and domination of women abound in pornography.  It is not just women, however, who are  victims of objectification, domination  and actual violence. The 'masculine'  mentality, which could be described  as 'might is right', inevitably creates  groups of 'others', based on their  differences in relation to those in control.  Black women are portrayed as castrators  or whores, and Asian women as passive,  seductive, alluring, but often waiting  for their opportunity to kill or trap  the man.   What is particularly appalling  in porn are the images of Asian women  in a jungle-setting tied to stakes.  This  is all painfully reminiscent of actual  rape scenes in Vietnam.

In the middle of this  current depression, Pattison is one capitalist who is making more money than ever.  One of the reasons is that most of his  holdings are in consumer goods: food,  transportation, sources of information.

In September of '84, an anonymous poster  appeared on the streets of Vancouver stating: "WHO IS THIS MAN. . . AND WHY IS HE  TRYING TO RAPE US?" On the poster was a  picture of Pattison, and some details of  his pornography business. In the last  year, many Lower Mainland feminists have  become concerned with the question of "Who  is this Man?". We are attempting to begin  to answer this question from our point of  view as workers at Vancouver Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter.  Pattison first came to our attention in  5 April of 1984 when women from the North  Shore Women's Centre used the Federal  Government's Fraser Commission on Pornography and Prostitution to reveal Pattison as  a major distributor .of pornography. His  company handles more than 18,000 publica-  1555 -tions, supplying 1,200 retail outlets as  well as educational outlets and school  boards. A Globe and Mail  article dated  February 8, 1984 quotes Canadian and U.S.  governments as saying that Canadians spend  an estimated $500 million annually on  pornography. About $63 million comes from  the sale of "illegal" hard-core pornography. This leaves $437 million in legal  sales, by far the greater profit.  The pornography marketed in Canada is produced in the U.S. Through his magazine  distribution companies - Mountain City  News in Ontario, Provincial News Co. in  Alberta,, the Yukon and N.W.T., and Mainland Magazines in B.C. - Pattison has  access to, and, in some places, a monopoly  over a fifth of the Canadian print pornography market. Besides Playboy,  Penthouse  etc., Pattison sells at least 250 'adult'  magazines full of pictures of women being  raped, sometimes incestuously.  Over the last few years we've seen sweeping re-arrangements in the finances of  B.C. The government has drained millions  of dollars out of social services and  fed that money back to big business.  Mega projects such as the ALRT, B.C. Place  and Expo 86 are used by business and  government to help effect this arrangement  and hide the facts from B.C. residents.  The B.C. Attorney General, Brian Smith,  has often used heavy-handed legal tactics  against anyone opposing the current policies - like the union picketers at the  Pennyfarthing Construction site last  - * March, or the prostitutes in the  I West End in May (1984). In contrast,  big businessman Pattison contravenes  the Criminal Code of Canada everyday, with immunity from prosecution.  A.  During the past year we have gather-  *ed information on Pattison by looking first at our own lives and the  » lives of women who call us one the  mf  crisis line. Other clues have been  ■ gathered through the media, by learn-  i   ing from other women's groups, and  by observing the moves of the govern-  Iment and corporations in B.C. Many of  - *us saw and discussed "Not a Love Story"  a film that travelled the country. Many  i.C. women participated as we did in the  Stop Red Hot Video' campaign of 1982.  Women in Canada have become increasingly  educated about the existence and realities  of pornography. Rape Relief women viewed  tapes from Red Hot Video, and examined the  print pornography available around us. We  read books such as Ordeal  by Linda Lovelace, Female Sexual Slavery  by Kathleen  Barry and Pornography  by Andrea Dworkin.  RESOLUTION 43 OF UN CONFERENCE ON WOMEN  IN COPENHAGEN 1980  Item 2:    Urges the government of State  members to recognize that women and  children are not a commodity and that  every woman and child has the right to  legal protection against abduction,  rape and prostitution;  Item 3: Further reminds governments  that women and children prostitutes have  the right to legal protection against  maltreatment which they may be subjected  to for the sole reason of their being  prostitutes;  We discussed among ourselves what we  knew about the effects of pornography,  in order to make decisions about how much  of our time and energy to spend fighting  it. Often we make those decisions by examining what an issue has to do with women  who call us at Rape Relief.  One woman had been repeatedly terrorized  by a man who left pornographic pictures  on her doorstep - some of it violent, some  of it "soft-core". At first, she was  confused and thought perhaps this was  just a joke or a sexual come-on. When  the man broke into her apartment and brutally raped her, his intentions became  clear. Kinesis June 1985 15  PORNOGRAPHY  Item 18: Like slavery in the usual sense,  prostitution has an economic aspect.  While being a cultural phenomenon rooted  in the masculine and feminine images  given currency by society,  it is a  market and indeed a very lucrative one.  The merchandise involved is men's  pleasure, or' their image of pleasure';  Item 19: In the industrialized market-  economy States,  a concern not to hamper  trade allows an overt market for eroticism and pornography to develop alongside  the discreet prostitution market.   The  two complement and reinforce each other.  The streets on which the sex shops are  located are those where prostitution   !  is heaviest.  -21 January 1983 submitted by the  special Rapporteur to the U.N.,  Mr. Jean Fernand-Laurent.  Another woman who was gang-raped on a  Vancouver side street was photographed  throughout her ordeal. No doubt these  photos became part of the underground  sales. The myth is that women are willing  participants - men claim we get good money  and we don't really mind doing it. When  you see the terror on the face of a woman  posed in a pornographic magazine, chances  are you are witnessing a frozen moment in  that woman's life, not a moment of acting.  We began to use the term "pornography  pimp" to describe Pattison because we saw  ed the injunction not just on behalf of the  street prostitutes - generally young, poor  and vulnerable - although we recognized  that the worst consequences would fall on  them, but also we fought for ourselves.  The injunction is a throw-back to the old  "Vag C" - the vagrancy law overturned by  earlier feminists. That law meant women  could be picked up by the police on suspicion of prostitution for not having  "enough".money in their pocket or not being  "properly" dressed. We knew that the new  order was worded so vaguely that the behaviour it named could apply to any one of  us. We could be in an exuberant mood in the  "wrong" part of town - wearing a T-shirt  with no bra in the West End or waving to a  friend on the other side of Davie Street -  and be subjected to arrest.  The injuction is an attack on all  women -  •especially poor women. We didn't understand  the injunction right away. First we saw  the threat to ourselves, and then we saw  the terrible jeopardy it placed women in  by naming them publicly on street lamps and  in MHR offices as prosititutes. Now their  neighbours, dates, social workers could  use the "fact" that they were "only prosti-.  tutes" to sexually abuse them. And some of  them did. -  The fear women shared reminded some of us  of the extra police powers used before  Montreal Expo '67 to sweep the city whenever  the cops wanted, as though for the security  of the coming 'visitors'. Over and over  the Vancouver city government claimed to  We began to use the term "pornography pimp" to describe Pattison  because we saw that for women in Canada the major difference  between prostitution and pornography lies in who's doing the selling  and the number of times she's sold.  that for women in Canada the major difference between prostitution and pornography  lies in who's doing the selling and the  number of times she's sold. Pornography is  a great improvement on the age old scam  of pimping, because a man can now vastly  increase the potential for profits by selling one woman's body many more times to a  much bigger market. He pays her only once,  if at all. Porn is also a way to make violence against women turn a profit.  In February, 1985, some 300 of us made a  silent candlelight march,down East Broadway  to mark and protest the death of Linda  Tatrai. Tatrai was a teenage prostitute,  one of the 30 women and men who were declared "Public Nuisances" by the Attorney  General of B.C., and subsequently driven out  of the West End by a sweeping, unprecedented injunction. As a collective, we protest-  be saving the West End from being a 'red  light district' and over and over again  they said they were not against prostitution. But their actions were driving young  runaways into brothels and creating an east  end 'red light district'.  The injuction also led us back to Pattison.  We began to speculate on what connection  it might have to Expo. It seemed to us  that prostitution is a "service" that will  be sought after by men coming to Expo.  Perhaps the problem was that the West End  didn't work very well as a red light district'. It was too easy for colourful young  . women to blend into the general street  scene. Now, strung out along Broadway,  Fraser and Main, prostitutes are much more  •easily available to tourists. Maybe that's  why they were moved.  ^fjpp  S=«^=^K2sL—.  if'  JjBf&jIS'       \    Ji                  1—mlf  ^^"Wry^if^ftr  j?l*r~*~,t>  -»   -r  -,.  ^a^ji ifejji  JffiU  2t -   I   ^i"~Sf>  tally mlmiJjr  Of hundreds of newsclippings on Pattison  found at the Public Library, it is difficult to find anything critical written about  him. Mostly, the media present Pattison  as a bright businessman - amiable, if  somewhat gauche. When he was caught selling  pornography, he was quick to proclaim his  shock. "I am offended by porn" the media  quotes. He claims that his empire is so  vast that he can't keep track of all his  companies, a claim contradicted by the  section of the press most likely to be  sympathetic to him:  But day to day it's still Pattison who  does the scrutinizing and sermonizing.  Twice a year he embarks on a gruelling  two-week tour of his plants, showrooms  and supermarkets across Canada and the  U.S., making it clear even to minor  managers that if there's a problem,  they're free to call him about it.  -Canadian Business Magazii  Dec.  '83.  Caught temporarily in a bad light, Pattison announced that he would wipe his hands  clean by selling the porn company to Van-  della Enterprises. In May, the Globe and  Mail  revealed that Vandella was owned by  a former director of a Pattison company.  We suspected that this was a deal on  paper only. In September, a reporter from  The Vancouver Sun  wrote that Mainland  Magazines was still owned and operated  by Jim Pattison.  The 'name change' game is an old one for  Pattison. In February of 1980 when he  was charged with "distributing obscene  material" through Mountain City News in  Hamilton, Ontario, Pattison managed to  stay out of court for one and a half years  with a simple trick. He changed the name  of the company to "Jim Pattison International" and back-dated the name-change  six months. Although some 18 magazine  titles, including Hustler,  had been  siezed, the final conviction (resulting in  a $12,000 fine) was for only one magazine,  Numbers,  featuring bondage and sado-masochism between white men. We suspect that  this conviction was more about homophobia  than about violence against women.  An important point to consider is the  amount of ideological  control that Pattison holdings afford him. Pornography is  one clear example, but there are others.  In June of '84, Dennis Patterson, the  Territorial Minister Responsible for the  Status of Women, made a presentation before the Fraser Commission in Yellowknife.  He said that traditional Inuit culture is  being "bombarded" by the influx of pornography with its racist and sexist messages.

PG.18 16 Kinesis June 1985  by Miriam Azrael  M.  1 orning is a long time coming when you're spending the night on someone else's  hotel room floor. For Aleta, it's better than the parking lot where she spent several  nights after fleeing the hotel she called home for a week, after being assaulted by  the manager in her hotel room. "Yes, he owes me money. I was paid up to the end  of the month," she says. "Of course I'm angry. But no way am I going back there."  I offer to go with her to the hotel to     .  claim the money and the few clothes that  she left behind, or to the police station  j  to lay a complaint.  "It won't do any good. Why bother?" This  is not a question but a conviction delivered with a shrug and a smile containing  bitter wisdom born out of an understanding  developed over many such similar incidents, j  My righteous indignation reveals me as  still an outsider. "The manager will never  admit what really happened, and who will  believe my story.?"  This too is hardly a question. Aleta  answers it herself with another shrug.  "And", she is adamant, "Absolutely no  police."  I have to respect her wishes. It's her  life and she seems adjusted to it. It  seems the only time she voluntarily  entered the police station for assistance,  she ended up getting charged herself.  "I didn't even know there was a warrant  out for me", she explains. "I had to  spend two months in jail just waiting  for trial. They weren't serious charges.  In the end I got a fine. Of course I  couldn't pay. I chose jail. Three square  meals and everything. I consider it a rest.";  This mixture of fatalism and a very deliberate acceptance of things, the tendency to  minimize even the most horrendous experience, is a common attitude on the street.  The way is to take things day by day, tending to immediate needs. These needs are  to eat and to sleep and to have a little  joy in life. It is survival in the city  stripped down to its lowest common denomi-  home base  ans to be  Living on the street, wit]  to sustain your existence  forever scrambling. With no roots one continues to grow, but with no( place to go in  particular, something else begins to be  called home. Aleta tells me: "Over the  years I've stayed in just about every  hotel and rooming hous'e in the area. You  make the best of it, and when it gets  intolerable, you move. It's the neighbourhood, really, the street community: not  the physical part of it, but the people,  that feels like home to me."  Home may be a feeling, but it must be a  place where a person can find peace and  rest, renewal and rejuvenation. Home is  the security of knowing that it is fairly  unlikely that you will have to clear out,  move on, often against your will and in a  hurry. Living on the street, security is  a luxury, and home can be seen to be found  in a bar or a needle or a pill.  Says Aleta, "I know that the bar isn't  home. Here, not that everybody loves  everybody, but we all know each other. To  a certain .extent, we watch out for each  other. At the same time, you have to watch  your own back. There's no way you can  survive down here if you forget that for  a minute."  I am sitting with Aleta at a side table in  \ of the quieter pubs near Main and Hast-  ;s. At intervals, we are joined by women  both know who stop by to say hello  and stay to chat. Ambivalence is expressed  about the street life. Most of the women  agree that the world is basically a hostile  place.  "A lot of us were abused at home. That's  why we ended up down here," says Karen.  She's older than Aleta and less resilient.  "I've lost track of the number of foster -  homes they stuck me in until I got fed up  and just took off on my own."  Many of the women have worked as prostitutes and a disproportionate number are  from broken, often violent, homes. General  health is poor, often neglected. Only a  few of these women have ever maintained  their own household. It's not a coincidence  that many of the women are addicts or  alcoholics.  The street is a hazardous resource with  its own demands. The protection, benefits  and opportunities offered to mainstream  women are not readily available for street  women, who are limited by their poverty  and lack of education. Without the security  of a home, subject to the demands of their  precarious lifestyle, its violence and  casual routine abuse, the street woman  seldom gets the chance to take a step back  and assess her life's expectations. Survival is an ongoing struggle.  While she must constantly reassess her  situation, there is rarely the opportunity  to be systematic, thorough and objective.  Yet without a careful analysis, realistic  plans for an alternate future cannot be  made or attempted.  Prison offers a poor sanctuary from the  street for many of these women. In the  cold season or when things are especially .  hard, prison is actually seen as an option  by some women with no satisfactory place  to go. Unfortunately, prisons do not provide an atmosphere conducive to healing,  creativity or good.mental health. Prison  In the cold season or when things  are especially hard, prison is  actually seen as an option.  is a dehumanizing experience that can  severely alienate the prisoner from both  society and self.  "Sure it's a fast life down here," says  Karen. "I've done things I'm not proud of.  Sometimes I can't believe some of the  things I've done for money. Yet I've taken  care of myself. I'm not a bad person. This  isn't the life I planned for myself. Too  much violence, too many risks, too many  things can go wrong.  "You're in a very vulnerable position,  especially the women working the streets.  I got to hate it so much, I thought I'd  rather sell drugs than sell my body. So  that's what I do now, to support myself."  I thought I had overcome the tendency to  ask this question, yet I find myself asking  Karen why she 'stays down here if she feels  this way. "I don't want to hurt your feelings," she says, and I can tell that she  is angry. "For all your talk about increas  ing choices for women, unless you're damn  lucky, you don't get anywhere else from  here but dead. Twice I've moved right  out of the area. Both times I ended up  crazy. I'd sit in the house alone. I  didn't know any of the neighbours. I missed  my community."  All of the women at the table have the  same questions and have reached the same  conclusions. "What would I do away from  this community? Where would I go? I am  trapped here." Each of the women feels  this. "I no longer have any choices."  I am ashamed that I don't have much in  the way of concrete suggestions that could  benefit Karen or Aleta or any of the women  gathered at my table. I can see what they  are up against. Their stories are so  similiar that when one of them stops talking, another from the circle can pick up  the thread without missing a stitch.  These women are representative of a growing population that inevitably gravitates  to the more depressed areas of all major  urban centres. The problems that they  face: chronic unemployment, sub-standard  housing, lack of meaningful options,  poor health, conflict with the law - are  compounded by a sense of powerlessness and  Angell's study confirms that "attention  must be made to social needs as well as 'Ģ  physical needs" and that "it is clear  that economic, health, and social considerations must be included when planning for  these women...Providing shelter combined  with co-ordinated and appropriate services  may be far more beneficial than the current  band-aid approach."  Most significantly, she notes that "Housing needs of Skid Row residents addressed  by urban renewal, such as relocation programs, have failed because they ignored  the social causes of the problem or the  needs of the residents." Concluding the  need is urgent, Angell recommends that  "the City should secure premises exclusively  for women."  Thi:  topi*  spec  Vancouver City Council in October 1979,  when Skid Row women were identified as a  priority group in need of housing. It  seems reasonable that every effort be made  to insure that something be done immediately to alleviate the situation.  The Vancouver Women's Shelter Society was  formed-in January 1983 as a direct response  to this continuing emergency. We are a  aalatffiSgUirttk.  . There is a gap between mainstream and street  women. The amenities and the order of a  conventional life are seen as unattainable,  beyond the scope of the street, especially  for a woman who has little formal educa- -  tion or job experience, and especially if  she has a criminal record. Society provides very little opportunity for integration of these women into the rest of society and very limited options for the destitute woman with a bad record of any kind.  Legislation does not protect these women  or their interests, thus ensuring that  they maintain an outlaw status, to the  detriment and risk of us all.  In other cities such as Toronto, Calgary,  and Ottawa, shelters exist that address  the street women's specific needs. In  Vancouver, the need for housing designed  for this group has been amply documented  in such studies as Residential Alternatives for Women on Vancouver's Skid Row  (1982, Corrine Lee Angell) and the 1979  Study of Housing of Single Women in the  Downtown Eastside. The specific problems  they discovered - dirty accomodations, no  locks on common bathrooms, hotels that  rent to men only, generally unsafe conditions - exist today.  various degrees of related work experience.  Our own observations have convinced us that  without meaningful intervention and some  fundamental changes in their situation,  many of the women down here will die young  and violently.  We are proposing to create a safe stable  environment which will function as a refuge for adult women in this area who are  at risk. We want to provide an alternative  to the bar scene and to help women break  free of the revolving door of prison and  the street. Our aim is to provide housing  and ancillary services for up to thirty  women, with some provision for shelter on  an emergency basis.  By situating the shelter right in the heart  of the problem area, and offering a variety  of services in the same facility, we hope  to be accessible to the women most in need.  The shelter will encompass four main areas.  The residential section will be separate  from the public area. There will be a  large kitchen and dining room where nutritious meals will be offered at cost and  where cooking lessons will be given. There  will be classrooms, a lounge, a library,  meditation and counselling rooms, a craft  area and laundry facilities. There -will be  workshops drawing on the expertise of  established women's groups and activities  directed to helping the women grapple  with problems they have faced for too  long on their own.  "I am convinced that many of our clients  both incarcerated and bound by orders for  supervision in the community will benefit  from a shelter located in that area,"  says Ted Harrison, Regional Director of  Corrections in Vancouver. "Many of these  women do not fit common molds and therefore are rejected from facilities and  services that are available to those who  can conform. In my view, we definitely  need a residential facility...that must  offer more than simply a place to sleep  and take meals."  The Shelter Society envisions a facility  co-operatively run by a staff trained and  able to respond to the situation as it is.  The routine will be individually determined and variable. Staff will be available .  to work with each woman to assist in  setting up a program. suitable to her personal development and level of functioning.  Personal changes will be accomplished as  a result of personal growth rather than of  coercion or fear of withdrawal of services.  It is expected that women will move  through three different levels of involvement during their stay at the refuge. Level  one will place an emphasis on regaining  health, on becoming familiar with and  comfortable within the facility, and  beginning an involvement in the available  programs. One to one counselling will be  offered at all times.  Level two will see the woman begin the  process of her individualized goal setting  and defining of needs. She will begin to  take advantage of the morning workshops  and will begin to establish self-directed  routines.  Level three will be indicated by the woman  moving out into the greater community and  making a commitment to long term goals.  These levels of course are not fixed; what  we hope is to be able to accomodate overlap  in the interest of meeting an individual's  unique needs. ^^^^E  The society has received project development funding from CMHC and has asked the  city to buy the building we have chosen.  For our purposes, the location we have  found is perfect; accessible, a clean  site, ready for renovations. "While your  concept is good," the mayor wrote us on  April 17, 1985, "your present service and  funding proposals are not yet sufficiently  developed to proceed in 1985."  "In my view we definitely need a  residential facility... that must  offer more than simply a place  to sleep and take meals."  What city planners would like, evidently,  is a plan toned down in scope, preferably  in another location. They are worried  that our project will not blend in with  the family housing that has just been  approved for the area. In addition, the  city is insisting that there be a definite  commitment from other levels of government  for capital expenses, staff, and operating  funds, before they consider our proposal  in a more serious way.  This is extremely short-sighted. What is  being overlooked here is that none of  the other social housing projects that  are slated to go ahead in the area even  begin to address this problem. In addition,  the support of CMHC is expressly for the  housing portion of the project, and we  cannot even apply for other funding until  the building is ours.  "Your project is never going to get off  the ground." The women at my table are  pessimistic and cautious.  'If you had your building I might go  there. It sounds like just what we need.  But the government won't support it. We're  an embarrassment. Even to the community  workers. Oh, not all of them, but most of  them, just wish we would disappear. We  just don't fit in to their idea of a "nice"  community."  I hate to admit that our dealings with the  community workers have also been discouraging. To us, it seems obvious what must  be done. We can't do it alone: we are  welcoming participation. Yet to date, the  support we have received is oblique and  the criticism very general. There seems to  be a myth that women's needs are being met  down here. We know this isn't so.  It is getting late. I'm starting to feel  the familiar tug of war between wanting to  stay and keep talking, and wanting to  retreat to my safe home. There is dinner  for me to prepare, tasks to attend to. I  am hungry.  For the women at my table, there is no  where else to go. The lucky ones know  where they will sleep tonight. Most of them  will not eat dinner. When I first started  coming down here as an extension of my work  with the B.C. Federation of Women, if I  couldn't find a place for a woman in need,  I'd bring her home. This proved to be unmanageable .  Two blocks from where we sit is an empty  building. It has been sitting, empty, for  almost four years now. The Vancouver Women's  Shelter Society has populated this building  with a vision. We have been told we can't  afford to go ahead with this project. We.  say we can't afford not to.

Creating alternatives in a hostile world t Kinesis June 1985  PORNOGRAPHY  In other ways, we are inundated with the  images of women that make Pattison money.  He owns Trans Ad - the company that controls ads in all buses, subways and bus  stops in 60 cities in Canada. Neonex,  another Pattison company, has absorbed  the majority of the competition in the  neon sign business in Canada. In Vancouver,  billboards have frequently been a target  for "redecoration" when they carry sexist  or imperialist messages. Through "Seaboard Advertising" in B.C. and "Hook Advertising" in Alberta, Pattison is Canada's biggest billboard owner.  When tourists arrive for Expo, they will  likely want to read Beautiful B.C.  magazine - a slick profit-maker that Pattison picked up from the Socreds during  their rush to "privatize" government  holdings. If these same tourists are  arriving from the U.S. and bringing with  them the guns that are such an accepted  component of American life, they will  be able to get instructions on the use  of these weapons from such magazines as  Soldier of Fortune  and Guns .and Survival  -  distributed by Mainland Magazines.  Pattison is under little obligation to  reveal his business dealings publically.  A standard Pattison answer to a probing  question is: "Well now, that's why we  have private companies - because we don't  like to answer questions like that." The  federal government says if he owns the  company alone he doesn't have to declare  his operations to anyone.  It seems significant that the one company  Pattison has kept for 18 years, despite  the fact that it loses money, is CJOR  woman's right to choose abortion, and  display their intention to limit women's  freedom.  There is an often repeated rumour that  one Sunday morning Pattison placed a  cheque for $1 million in the Glad Tidings  collection plate. "I'm sure that others  have given more, according to their  ability", Pattison says in Canadian Business  in December, 1983, to perpetuate the  rumour. Immediately after our leafletting  action at the church we received a letter  on Glad Tiding's letterhead denying that  Pattison had ever been a member of the  church. They sent a copy to Pattison.  According, to a Province  survey conducted  in June of 1984 (based on a random sample  of 3,470) 93% of women and 64% of men  believe that exposure to pornography increases sexual offences and other aggresive  and anti-social behaviours. The survey  said clearly that most people did not  want violent pornography avialable in any  form.  We understood that to eliminate the  pornography industry it would be necessary  to attack it from all sides.-Women had  already invested a fair amount of energy  in persuading individual men to stop  consuming pornography, and to work on  other men to do the same. In B.C., women  have actively gone after retailers with  complaints, by picketing, by destroying  merchandise and by firebombing stores.  However, we were also beginning to understand that it was the distributors who  actually created the market by bringing  products in from the States and forcing  local merchants to display it with other  print.  A standard Patterson answer to a probing question is: "Well now,  that's why we have private companies — because we don't like to  answer questions like that."  I.  radio. When Dave Barret, former premier  of B.C., stepped down as leader of the  N.D.P. and moved up financially to his  new job as radio broadcaster for CJOR  in the Fall of '84, one of his first assignments was to interview his new boss,  Jim Pattison. The topic was Expo, and the  style was friendly, non-confrontational.  (The two men have been lunching together  for years).  The one sour note in the lengthy interview  was Nicole, a member of our collective, on  the phone-in line voicing questions about  pornography. Pattison brushed her off by  saying that "82 titles are no longer,being  sold."  Suddenly, the man who claimed to be "offended by porn" - all porn - was deciding that  some porn was more "acceptable". He was  also reversing a public explanation made  by "John Seebach, president of Mainland  Magazines, in an address to a local anti-  pornography coalition. In June of '84,  Seebach said that Pattison's company was  under powerful pressure from the American  source distributors to either "take Penthouse    - or you can't take Ladies Home   ■  Journal."  Now Pattison was saying that he  could control what was distributed locally.  There are many reasons why feminists are  concerned about the messages that Pattison is using his empire to sell. Pattison's  connection to a fundamentalist church  warned us of the effort those religious  groups have used to "keep women in their  places". Recently in Vancouver, 3,000  angry demonstrators answered the call of  their right wing leaders to protest a  Many women and women's groups have fought  the Pattison empire. Pattison retaliated  by stirring up trouble among us. Shortly  after the Fraser Commission hearings, a  coalition of women's groups, including  North Shore, Canadian Congress of Women,  University Women's Club, Vancouver Council  of Women arid Canadian Council against  Media Pornography pressured City Hall to  "call up" the magazine distributors and  force them to answer questions about the  industry.  Pattison retaliated by calling a meeting  of his own, inviting representatives from  churches, women's groups and the mayor's  office to meet with him privately on his  terms on the day before the public meeting.  There was a great deal of controversy  within the coaliton over whether or not  to attend this meeting.  Women did not want to collude in any way  with Pattison. Some were concerned that  this meeting was going to go ahead with  Or without them. In the end, some women  attended, over the strong objections of  others. Several things came of this May  2nd meeting. Pattison got more agreement  for his.Review Board proposal, and women  attending found out about an upcoming  magazine distributors' convention, which  proved to be a useful source of information.  The creation of the Review Board was  Pattison's work. He got the ten B.C.  distributors to meet and offer jointly  to pay three people to screen their porn  for Community Standards. The porn pimps  would "voluntarily withdraw" from us  anything these three people found objec-   •  tionable or thought was illegal.  In analyzing the purposes of the Review  Board proposal, we compared it to a tactic  used with apparent success by Pattison  in "dealing with" his employees. It's a  method he learned from Japanese capitalists:  the "quality circle". A meeting is called  of workers and managers ot discuss complaints and suggestions. The theme is  "we're all in this together". What gets  hidden in the hierarchy - the fact that  some of us are in this able to command,  and some of us must take orders. By  promoting the notion of open discussion  and co-operation what often gets preempted is union organizing - and any real  power for the workers.  Similarly, the tone of the Review Board  is of "co-operation". Because the magazine  distributors voluntarily submit to the  rulings of the board, for a relatively  small amount of money (salaries) they  get to appear to be concerned with <  ty standards. By claiming to be  able to an outside "authority", they likely  will not lose money to their American  suppliers. They also avoid publicity for  any consequences of their products. The  Attorney General and the distributors  benefit by avoiding prosecutions under  the obscenity law.  "The industry should be policing itself"  the A.G. was quoted as saying is a  Vancouver Courier  article dated May 19,  1984 and entitled 'A.G. Applauds Pattison  on Porn'. The two women and man on the  board do the work of "reviewing" an  impossible amount of print pronography  per month and are set up as if they were  responsible for what they don't stop.  And in the interests of stopping the 'worst  of the stuff, ordinary, everyday exploitation of women slips by as if it had been  approved.  On May 3, 1984, the Vancouver City Council  Community Services Committee met. Pattison avoided appearing himself by persuading George Brammel of Vancouver Magazine,  his chief "competitor", to speak for both  of them. The committee voted unanimously  and pointlessly for Pattison to keep  Mainland, but not sell pornography, a  suggestion he ignored. The meeting also  put together a series of recommendations  to City Council and subsequently a number  of rather hasty resolutions were passed  about how to display porn.  Events were moving quickly. At the same  time as we were"struggling to understand  the City Council moves and to figure out'  how they could be useful to us, the  interim injunction was issued against the  prostitutes in the West End.  While the provincial government and city  hall appeared bumbling and avoided dealing  with this porn pimp they moved gracefully  and with the force of an axe to publish  the injunction against women's use of the  West End of the city. Thirty people were  named - and room was left for unidentified  others - as prostitutes, and told they were  banished from one whole section of the city.  The police were free to snatch them from  the streets. They had no way to appeal or  fight. We had no way to avoid being named  Public Nuisance #31.  We were beginning to see that the injunction was becoming a favoured tool of the  government. We had seen an injunction  used very successfully to minimize the uproar over the Socred's massive social service cuts. Although Rape Relief women wanted women's groups to evade government  control through financing we did not want  governments to dump women's groups into  further poverty. When the same tactic was  used against pickets on the Kerkhoff line,  we saw ourselves as clearly aligned with  the union when it was being attacked from  above. HEALTlf  Kinesis June 1985 19  Feminist politics  going up in smoke  by Annette Clough  FACT - Lung cancer now equals and will  soon surpass breast cancer as the  leading cause of cancer deaths in  U.S. women.  FACT - Smoking causes about 85% of lung  cancer in women.  FACT - Besides the well-known links with  lung cancer, cardiovascular disease  and emphysema, smoking is also  linked with other cancers and lung  diseases, recurring ulcers, hearing  loss, problem pregnancies, harm to  unborn babies, optical damage, menopausal problems and osteoporosis,  among others.  FACT - The U.S. tobacco industry spends .  over $1 billion annually on advertising and promotions and withdraws  its ads from magazines which run  critical articles on smoking and  health.  FACT - Now that many North Americans are  quitting smoking, the tobacco multinationals are engaging in massive  advertising campaigns in Third  World countries while more and more  of their agricultural land is being  turned over to tobacco.  FACT - In the twentieth century, tobacco  has killed more people than war.  If cigarettes were drugs and the tobacco  companies were drug companies, feminists  would surely have made smoking a political  issue long ago. The parallels between cigarettes and, for example, the birth control pill or estrogen replacement therapy  are obvious: many well-documented health  risks, a well-financed advertising campaign, production by corporations with  powerful lobbies and clear links with the  establishment, and huge profits from their  sale.  Why, then, do many feminists who have been  outraged for years by the cynical approach  to women's health by the drug industry see  smoking not as an equally serious health  issue as the pill,or ERT, or as a political  issue, but as a matter of personal choice?  The "right to choose" is so basic a feminist tenet that it seems hard to argue  with, and control over one's body may indeed include the right to harm it in any  way one chooses. That right, however, ends  when it infringes on the rights of others  who choose not to smoke and their right  to breathe clean air.  Apart from being annoying k£a§ non-smoker,  sidestream smoke (the smokef.gljat goes directly into the air from a.-j^toirning cigarette) presents a very real-:!$iiealth hazard  to the non-smoker. One Canadian study of  non-smokers in a working Environment demonstrated that passive smoking (the inhalation by non-smokers of t^eacfco-polluted  air) was equivalent to smi^kirig ten cigarettes a day. ; ////,  Sidestream smoke contains tvifee as much  tar and nicotine, five times'?&s much carbon monoxide and fifty timesik/s much ammonia as inhaled smoke. A fourteen year Japanese study reported a twofoldnjtficrease in  lung cancer in non-smoking ^b^en who lived  with smokers. }J/j  So where is the "choice" of/^trhe non-smoker?  Leave her job? Not go to p^ffeies or bars?  Leave home? It is ironic 1$ja&  we can call  the police to stop a neigfejSur making  noise after 11 pm but we^qrinot do anything  about a co-worker who fof&es us to breathe  sidestream smoke (urij.esS;i.1:he individual  office has a no smoking policy).  And what about the "rights" of children  who cannot "choose" wjiere to live? A recent study from Bostoift showed that children who live in house'^lds where people  smoke are at a signi^BvJ-iiant health disadvantage, including ^Wftated eyes and nas-  as passages and inclosed respiratory infections. A study f^tijj/.McMaster University  in Ontario pronounc^af(vsmoking at home a  greater risk to ch||;iren'si'. health than industrial air poll\4tSibn. .Smokers' children  have more asthma,fj'wheez-i^g, coughing and  colds. @|  If smoking were a rational, choice for women,  based on health or p^fifctical concerns, there  would be no smokersfijfLy,   then, were 33% of  Canadian women smok\|ftjg in 1981? Why are  more men than wom^^ow giving up smoking?  Have women, usualit-^jjso aware of the manipulations of the ;^vertising industry,  really bought th$S.-s.moker-as-liberated-  woman-Virginia-Slf^ifrs image? Why does the  issue of smifikingj^roduce all kinds of  defensive rationalizations in women who  would otherWise^be the first to condemn  industries ^fiose/products maim and kill  women? Why ^0 wofien smokers need to smoke?  The easy ai|swer]:Jp.s that nicotine is physically addic'ti^er£ but nicotine does not fill  all the criteria' for a drug which creates  physical depe]ri£lience. The phenomena of  'tolerance' ,-iiJQ 'withdrawal syndrome1 do  not apply afeplearly as to other addictive  drugs. Smok^ys do not usually keep increasing their.jfdai.ly number of cigarettes past  10-25 a d&yt,  whereas someone dependent on  a narcotic-becomes more 'tolerant' and needs  more and>more of a drug to achieve the  desired;(<effect. Some smokers experience  unpleasant 'withdrawal' symptoms when they  try tft'stop, but many don't.  It*" seems that smoking is much more than a  physical addiction and may have more to do  with social and psychological factors.  Peer pressure and the identificiation of  smoking with being "cool" and sophisticated  has no doubt led many, particularly teenage  and younger women, to smoking. Smoking has  been sold to us as something the confident  and independent woman, the woman who knows  she is equal to men, does.  It is probably no coincidence that the number of women smokers rose during the beginnings of the second wave of feminism  in the sixties and seventies. Tobacco com  panies were quick to respond by gearing  some of their advertising specifically at  women. Once again the industries of a sexist society found a way to exploit women's  vulnerabilities.  More basic, though, than complying with a  certain image of the modern woman, is the  way in which smoking can give women the  illusion of coping with stressful lives.  The Addiction Research Unit in London,  England has concluded that women tend to  use smoking as a sedative, whereas men  tend to use it as a stimulant. More men  than women report smoking for pleasure.  Women may in fact need smoking more than  men do. In a society where women are socialized not to express their feelings, especially anger, and where feeling "out of  control" emotionally is a frightening experience for most women, smoking is a way  to control feelings, especially anger and  aggression. Smoking becomes a safety valve,  the alternative to letting off steam. Feelings can be pushed down by inhaling smoke  or released as puffs of smoke. The real  feelings, which might have serious consequences if released, are not recognized or  experienced.  As a woman in The Ladykillers said, "Our  husbands can explode when they come home  but we can't. We are supposed to absorb  the frustrations of everyone else in the  family and still maintain the image of  super-wife and mother. I don't want to  scream or yell at the family, so I smoke".  From a feminist perspective, it becomes  evident that the need of many women to  smoke is grounded in their situation in  society. This doesn't mean that non-smokers  The Addiction Research Unit in  London, England has concluded  that women tend to use smoking  as a sedative, whereas men tend  to use it as a stimulant. More  men than women report smoking  for pleasure.  necessarily have more access to their  feelings - there are other ways to supr-  press emotions - but smoking has provided a socially sanctioned way to  swallow emotions and not have to deal  with them.  Perhaps if women saw why they smoked in  this light, it would be easier for them  to stop. Many women try to stop smoking  and start again because they cannot deal  with the feelings that come to the surface. If a woman can somehow create a  situation in which it is safe for her  to experience her feelings and change  her way of dealing with them, then she  will be on her way to not needing to  smoke.  The self-help group model is well suited  to a woman trying to give up smoking.  Here she can find understanding of why  she needs to smoke and support to make  the change. Quitting smoking isn't easy,  but it would be easier in an atmosphere  of support and understanding. The benefits  are obvious.  The Ladykillers: Why Smoking is a Feminist  Issue.   Bobbie Jacobson.

The beauty queens  were the less built women ^who were the  obvious favorites with the IFBB officials  - <->>-! s film because o  obvious favorites wa.^..  Controversy surrounds this film because of  the inclusion of Bev Francis. Is she too  muscular, i.e. masculine? Would the audience  be turned off by her? The male IFBB officials'  fear of Bev Francis was quite evident.  Shocked by her presence they warned judges  to remember that they are judging a women's  contest and they must look like women." A  woman judge declared on camera that "it  would be a total disaster if Bev Francis won.  She does not respect what women want to look  like". This prejudice somewhat rubbed off  onto Bev. Backstage, after the competition,  she looked at her trainer and asked, "Did I  look like a girl?"  While counting votes, IFBB officials again  felt Bev was a problem because some of the  judges had given her good marks. "Obviously  the judges didn't understand what they were  told", said one. As a result, they gave Bev  last place.  The Ridge Theater audience did not agree,  i They booed and hissed when judges discreditiei  her. They applauded and whistled when she  presented her poses. Despite the IFBB's and  the filmmakers' fears, Bev Francis stole the  show with her natural warmth, humour and  professionalism, not to mention her stunning  body. ' 1|§£|P  It would have been a better film if there  was less footage of Rachel McLish and her  Christian born-again philosophies, and more  footage of Carla Dunlap. Probably the most  respected and admired of women bodybuilders,  Carla was truly a sensation to watch. Her  support for the other competitors and recognition of the misogyny in the judging provide some hope for the future of this sport.  A lot of the film was staged with endless  discussions of whether muscular women were  femininine (are male bodybuilders ever told  they are too muscular?) and did not present  any conclusions. More candid interviews with  the women and fewer close-ups of thighs,  crotches and painted lips, would have been  nice.  ; Pumping Iron II  is a male-made film about a  'fj  male-controlled sport.

Then women came together to  exchange information about their treatment  by doctors. They moved from this consciousness raising about the medical profession  to gynecological self examinations and research about their own health concerns.  Our Bodies,  Ourselves  was first published  in the early 1970's and for years has been  the only comprehensive book about women's  health. Many copies have passed through the  hands of women; some searching for information about particular health issues and  others just discovering the feminist approach to health care.  The New Our Bodies,  Ourselves: A Book. By  And For Women.   The Boston Women's Health  Collective. Simon and Schuster, Inc.  New York, 1984  be incorporated in one place. As with the  old format, chapters contain quotes from  various women about their own experiences as  well as medical and health information and  political analysis. Extensive reference  bibliographies are at the end of chapters.  There is nothing else to compare with this  gathering of women's health information.  Such an undertaking is not without its problems. The Boston Women's Health Book Collective are white women from mostly middle  class backgrounds with seemingly quite a  bit of education. They have attempted to  include information about and from a wider  range of women.  But chapters are uneven. I was dismayed that  the chapter about-food failed to mention  that the healthy diet the writers were  proposing was easier to attain when one had  more money or education or both. No help was  offerred to those with financial problems.  In the section on menstrual problems women  Some fifteen years later we now know much  more information about a wide range of areas  denoted as women's health, far beyond gynecology, birth control, abortion, pregnancy  and birth. After a'long wait," The New Our  Bodies,  Ourselves  is out in an entirely  rewritten, updated and expanded edition  which reflects the scope of this knowledge.  Included in the" book are chapters about  body image, addictions, emotional therapy,  occupational and environmental health, vio-'  lence against women, the new reproductive  technologies and women growing older. (Yes,  there is more than menopause.) Many sections  which were small in the original version are  now expanded such as sections about lesbians,  nutrition, and sexually transmitted diseases.  You may be wondering how all that is packed  into the format of the Our Bodies,  Ourselves  which you might be familiar with. This is a  completely new book and it is twice as big  as the original. It is a really big book;  more properly a reference book. Both women  who are familiar with the old version and  women who are unfamiliar with feminist health  care will want to use this book for an overview of women's health and an introduction  to particular concerns.  Unfortunately for us in Canada the size of  this new edition translates into higher  cost. With the descending Canadian dollar  the price becomes almost $20 at most bookstores here. The Vancouver Women's Health  Collective will be selling the book for much  less than this bookstore price.  To cover many topics collectively is an  ambitious task. The Boston Women's Health  Book Collective is the cornerstone of The  New Our Bodies,  Ourselves.   Individual chapters were written by different combinations  of women, many not actually members of the  collective. Each chapter apparently was  edited by most members of the collective.  The endeavor has enabled much information  and many different women's experiences to  Eioned to "get restandplan crit:  meetings for times when they are not premenstrual." This is little help for women  with clerical or serv.ice jobs, and little  help for mothers.  I do not think that The New Our Bodies,  Ourselves  is an easy book to read for anyone  who does not have many educational skills.  Compared to the old edition there is a  higher ratio of pages of print to pages  that include some graphics. Many chapers  contain numerous footnotes, asterisks and  double and triple asterisks. There were  times when I had to use my fingers to hold,  places so that I could read in some sort  of continuous manner. Sometimes this information could have been added to the text in  a less academic fashion.  Since the writing comes from so many different women some parts are more accessible to women with less education and under-  Graphics from Our Bodies Ourselves  standing of health issues than others. Sometimes medical terminology is used in a new  chapter and not defined or explained until  later in the chapter.  Many of the diagrams used to illustrate  medical information are unclear. Body parts  are labelled and indicated with so many  lines and arrows that it is difficult to  get a sense of what is where. Shading and  lined areas to denote depth make some of the  drawings dark, overbearing and flat. It is  difficult not to compare these drawings  with those by Suzanne Gage who illustrated  How To Stay Out of the Gynecologist 's Office  and A New View of a Woman's Body.  Gage's  drawings are given more space on a page  and are clear and beautiful to look at.  Another general problem is that some of the  information should have been placed in  greater perspective. The psychotherapy and  alternate healing chapters, for example,  contain information about types of therapies. There is a limited selection. Does  this reflect the authors' experience or is  that what is, available in Boston? I would  have appreciated a list at the end of the  chapters indicating that there are many  more types of therapies available to women.  The authors also could have placed their  ideas in less of a reference position. The  information presented is really only what  they know now and what they have had experience with. Some information is controversial  and not labelled as such. In the section on-  pelvic inflammatory disease (P.I.D.) sperm  transporting bacteria into the uterus is  mentioned as a way of getting P.I^.D. Researchers know that bacteria can attach  itself to sperm, but they are far from  agreed that this is how women get,P.I.D.  Lesbian health concerns stili have a chapter  of their own. Attempts have been made to  integrate lesbian concerns throughout the  book, particularly in a general chapter on  sexuality. There is a new chapter about relationships with men to try to balance the  chapter on lesbians. Unfortunately the chapter on birth control still makes use of a  . universal "we" for women, implying all women.  I am a bit concerned that after a general  discussion about lesbianism, sexuality and  legal issues around health care that the  first medical issue to be addressed is alcoholism. It is questionable whether this is  in fact a unique lesbian issue. Other possible lesbian health issues such as hypertension, breast cancer and hysterectomy  abuse are missing.  At the end of the book is a nascent section  about Developing an International Awareness.  Alas, Canada is notably missing. The only  resource listed for Canada is Healthsharing,  and it is listed as a newsletter rather than  the magazine that it is. Hopefully a Canadian  resource section will be compiled for future  .editions of the book. Many women in Canada  will undoubtedly purchase and make use of  this book. Too often the information flow  is from south to north. There are numerous  Canadian resources as valuable as any 'mentioned in The New Our Bodies,   Ourselves.  Of  course readers will find that the sections  on abortion and references to health care  structures relate only to the U.S. experience,  In reviewing The New Our Bodies,  Ourselves  I did something which most people will never  do - I read the whole book at once. Our  Bodies,   Ourselves  was always a book whose  use increased over time. The new edition will  be used in the same way. It contains a lot  of good and interesting information. Just  don't expect it to have all the answers. You  j  probably have to go elsewhere for further    j  information so that you can be fully informed  about your own health care.

Ilene was also a regular at the Full Circle  Coffee House on 8th near Main, and I seem  to recall one infamous night when someone  pulled the plug on her and Bells because an  unruly crowd of women, fresh from the WAR  demonstration, wanted to dance to records.  Ilene and Bells is another story. They sang  together for a couple of years, travelled  across the U.S. and back, and took their  music to Europe. By then, Ilene was playing  fiddle, and with Bells on guitar and mandolin, they entertained non-english speaking  audiences with such original hits as Lesbe-  radas,   ("in a wild western town, passing  liberated garlic around. Lesberadas, renegades, nozama, amazons. Nozama is amazon  spelled backwards, right?"), and occasionally when passing the hat, someone would say  in English, "Oh, that was interesting."  Ilene returned to Canada in 1979. She became  involved in a relationship, moved into a  house full of women and started parenting a  three year old child. She changed her name  to Maura, and later to Maura Volante. The  combination.of names signified her connection to water, and to the three stages of a  woman's life: maiden, mother and crone.  Her music changed, too. She stopped singing  in public for a time, but continued to sing  for recreation. She experimented with free-  form. When it was time to step out again,  she wrote music to Cyndia Cole's poetry.  | ' She and Luna sang while Chantalle Laplante  played piano. They called one performance  New Weave.

It was at Simon Fraser University at a benefit for Press Gang,  put on by Womankind. They had about 10 performers and then a dance. And since I was  going to sing Hang In there,  which they  thought was a good ending song, they put me  on at the end.  So for about an hour before the end of the  performances, there were these crowds of  women waiting to dance. So I got up there -  my first performance in the women's community - and I had to cut it short and only do  two songs. I felt it to be a very restless  crowd, but I also felt that there were women  who were listening.  J remember you singing everywhere.  There were always benefits, coffee houses.  And there would be people...yourself,  Ferron, Jane Perks, myself...I mean we  all kind of shared the bill and we were  all just sort of starting out and finding  our way.  What did music represent to you when you  .  first began to sing? Was there a message  ■that you wanted to share?  •In the beginning, if you were going to be a  singer, you had to be a star. That was the  model. But now I^ve come around to seeing  that the way I'm going to use my singing is  "If you were going to be a singer, you had to be a star. That was the  model. But now I've come around to seeing that the way I'm going to use  my singing is going to be different from that star model."  Late:  Mau:  given a conga drum, and  Denman Island, she played  Do you sense that our community has a  musical history?  Yes I do. And I think that a lot of women  who weren't there might not know that, because it was mostly live stuff that wasn't  recorded and not all of us carried through  to become stars. So a woman coming into the  city now wouldn't realize how many performers there were of women's music back then,  who later went on to do other things. Or  who are doing music in different ways. I  think that Ferron is the only one who emerged  out of that to become well-known. And incredibly well-known. More so than we ever would  have imagined at the time.  Why did you make the break from traditional  folk music?  Gradually I began to feel more limited by  that, as I was coming into a feminist consciousness, and I was searching high and low.  for songs thai had strong women characters •  in them. But then - when I came out as a  lesbian, it seemed like 99% of my repertoire  was suddenly irrelevant because it was all  about men. Whether the women were strong or  not, their lives revolved around men.  So I didn't have very many songs to sing.  Then I started learning songs by contemporary women, and some by women who were in  the folk scene, like Malvina Reynolds who  was writing feminist songs, and Hazel Dickens and Alice Gerard. So I was still in the  folk milieu. It was while I was doing that  kind of thing that I first performed for the  women's community.  going to be different from that star model.  When I got very politicized in the women's  movement, I felt that singing was something  I could use to get a message across. I felt  very much like that. That was why I was sing-l  ing. It was what I had to offer.  I've never been a singer who could sing stuffl  that she didn't agree with. Well, back in the]  early days, I.could sing stuff that was not  very meaningful to me. But it wasn't offensive at that time. Gradually more and more  in the mainstream of music became offensive  to mo or so meaningless that I just couldn't  relate to it.  So that's been a problem forme. A lot of  people have suggested to me, "Oh learn a few  pop songs and you'll get along.", I can't do  it, you know. I'd rather sing as an instrument without any words. So I'm really what  some people would call hung up on the content. Content is extremely important to me.  What were your early themes?  Women awakening to a consciousness is one of  the things. I always went for the positive  and hopeful. But somehow it seems like it  was easier then to do that. I don't know. It  seemed simpler then. Some of the songs I  wrote myself around that time, like one that  I called Ocean Song  -"I'm going to jump back  into the ocean, until the earth can be a  home again...."

Duncan was born in Brantford,  Ontario, in 1861 and from an early age  pursued her writing career "against the  conventions of her class and sex." She  was a teacher for a short time before  working her way into the world of journalism. After extensive experience in that  field she launched herself as a "roving  shares an appreciation of Art and a  sense of being different from the rest  of their community. They both admire an  unconventional artist temporarily in  their area and the narrator is torn by  his feelings for the two of them, especially as Dora falls in love with the young  man. The artist eventually alienates  Dora by compromising his art for commerce,  and by running away to escape the possible bond of marriage. Dora and the narrator then marry and share their view of  society as soul mates.  In 'The Hesitation of Miss Anderson' a  young American woman, Madeline, travels  extensively after the death of a man to  whom she was engaged but who dropped her  to marry another woman, Violet. Violet  was later reported to be dead. Miss Anderson turns up in an Anglo-Indian outpost  and soon forms a strong attachment to a  married officer whose wife is away. They  share a certain sensitivity and see themselves as somehow different from their  shallow, flirtatious, or dull peers in  the community. The officer's wife returns  and is, of course, Violet, Madeline's  ex-finance's wife, thought to be dead,  but alive and well and obviously an  adultress.

She  met her husband while on .a job in India  arid lived with him there from 1890 until  1919. She died in England in 1922, aged  61.  The Pool In The Desert.  By Sara Jeanette  Duncan. Introduction by Rosemary Sullivan.  Penguin Short Fiction. Paperback. $5.95.  Most of the story is taken up with Madeline's serious moral dilemma, which is  eventually resolved by Violet's own  instinct for self-preservation, and Madeline is able to marry her love and live  happily, away from India.  The Pool In The Desert  in some sense sums  up the themes of all four stories. It  too, tells of an unusual, intelligent,  cultivated woman on an outpost, who fails  in love with her best friend's son. The  young man is seen by Judy as her 'pool i  the desert' of boredom, insensitivity an  shallowness. She is prepared to risk everything - her precious friendship with the  boy's mother, her marriage, and everyone's  reputations - in order to save her sanity  and to feel fulfilled by her love. However,  convention and duty save her when her  husband is due to go into battle and she  rallies to the situation as she is  expected to.  The main characters in these stories are  unconventional, out of step in some way,  and see the rest of their communities as  lacking in taste and sensitivity. Conventional marriage is seen as constraining  and limiting, and leads almost inevitably  to a search for, and response to, an outside person who is also seen as set apart  from the crowd.  The featured women are portrayed as intelligent, cultured, witty, sensitive and  different. They are interesting, independent thinkers, but are not feminists.  Their strengths are purely personal and  they show no sympathy with the foibles  of the "ordinary" women in their environment, and find their equals only in men. '  The writing in these stories is delicate,  intricate, witty and sometimes thoughtful.  That the stories are set in India seems  totally irrelevant, as Indians are rarely  acknowledged, as background or even as  servants. The stories do give insight into  the tight colonial worlds of those whose  'burden' it was to maintain and uphold  the Empire. The constraints on and subsequent rebellion of, the Anglo women in  those communities was probably exacerbated  by the geographic and social isolation and  by the pressures of the perceived necessity to 'keep up the side' and never to  lower defences.  I think the interest in these stories  lies in. the descriptions of the women who  go against the conventions of their communities, and the way in which all of  these difficult situations are eventually  dealt with by adhering to other conventions and etiquette of those same communities. "Correct" behaviour always serves  to avert social and emotional disaster.  The four short stories in this collection  seem to reflect the author's experiences,  both as an independent unconventional  woman, and as a colonial wife in British  India before World War II. The stories  are set in India, among the ruling British ghettoes (colonial administration  centres) and all deal with the lives of  women in that environment.  In 'A Mother In India' a woman who sent  her sickly baby "back home" to be raised  by'relatives is expected to bring this  grown daughter to India to be launched  into 'society'. The story mainly deals  with the woman's inability to dredge  up maternal feelings for this nice but  boring and unimaginative stranger. The  mother feels compelled to intervene in  the budding romance she sees developing  between her daughter and a charming young  man with whom the mother shared a special  friendship. He responds to the daughter  partly in response to what he sees as  the mother's "unnatural" lack of maternal-  ism.  'An Impossible Ideal' is told from the  point of view of a man in love with a  much younger woman, Dora, with whom he  Jjr  Jimi.

When excerpts  from Lesbian Nuns: Breaking the Silence  were published without the contributors'  permission in Penthouse's Forum magazine,  some of them, and their supporters, reacted  angrily. Publisher Barbara Grier defended  her decision by saying that the earnings  would bankroll less popular lesbian books, a  and it was an opportunity to expose lesbian  literature to a wider audience.  Last month, the National Film Board's Studio  D released their new documentary film about  nuns, Behind the  Veil,  and I expected an  equal amount of controversy. For one thing  I saw it in Winnipeg which has been the  scene of bitter dispute among religious women and feminists this spring. The downtown  theatre was packed with women from opposite  sides of both the Morgentaler abortion clinic fight, and the campaign to remove HERizons  magazine from the public schools for  its lesbian and so-called manhating content.  I also expected an adverse response to the  film as Studio D, the women's unit, has  been targetted by REAL Women.  In the question period that followed with  the film makers, the expected debate never  materialized. I'd like to think this was due  to the excellence of the film. The film addressed a whole gamut of controversial  issues about the subjugation of women in the  Church and their fight to overcome it. It is  an affirmatively feminist script with a  very explicit critique of patriarchy in the  Church.  The film includes a discussion of sex and  .celibacy which does not exclude lesbianism,  but does not specifically address the  Instead the film radiates a lesbianism of  the most universal catholic sense. There are  many loving shots of women together, erijoy-  Margaret Westcott, director  ing one another's company, laughing, talking  embracing. The story of a couple of the nuns  deciding to live and work together elicited  a lot of knowing sighs from the audience,  and very early on there are those tell-tale  words about 'women of all varied lifestyles'  represented among women religious. But the  worl lesbian is never mentioned and that felt  like a very pregnant silence.  There are other striking parallels in the  depiction of women religious living separately from men. Instead of choosing life  with an individual man, these women have taken a vow to love and serve all women and  men. When they speak of their call to serve,  it is reminiscent of women speaking about  coming out as lesbians or more broadly to a  committment to feminism and to changing their  lives and the world around them. Some of the  nuns speak of joining after a long spiritual  journey, others from the pressure of family  and tradition, and others from an .early realization that this was their path.  The bright and colourful cinematography captures the spectra of lifechoices represented.  The Canadian women's crew went to Italy, Ireland, the United States and Quebec to show  the wide variety of ways that contemporary  nuns make their lives. The rich greens of the  groves of a Trappist monastery near Rome  combine with the white habits of. a Benedect-  ine cloister in Quebec and contrast with a  bright colours of Black women dancing in a  jail in Chicago.  Some of the women live the traditional life  behind the veil of centuries past, while  others work at jobs more familiar to us in  the outside community, in a hamburger joint,  a women's hostel or department store.  The film suggests these women's autonomy  from men has allowed them to speak very  clearly about the problems of the male-dom- .  inated Church, and of the need to include a  feminist perspective in the leadership.  They speak for the autonomy of all Roman  Catholics to direct their own lives, and  of the sinfulness of the Church hierarchy  that prevents that. Unfortunately the radical  voices are mostly American.  The notable exception is Sister Margaret  McMurtin of Dublin. In one charming passage  this lively woman talks of how falling in  live is an occurrence all nuns live with,  and deal with, and how she would probably  have been polygamous if she had not been  a nun. As a history scholar she talks of her  research in Rome and of the role of women  in the Celtic tradition of Ireland.  This is perhaps the most stunning part of  the film. Showing some of the earliest  fountains and places of worship, the film    \  depicts the goddess religion which celebrated the cycle of life on the earth. Women  took an integral part, so much so that the  goddess is mixed up in early Irish Cathol^-  ic mythology. Brigid was one of the names  given to the goddess and also the name of  the first woman bishop and saint. She  founded a double monastery which continued  as a centre of learning for over 700 years.  With impressive visual documentation from  early art, literature and archaeological  finding, the film reveals women's central  place in the early Christian church. In the  beginnings in Rome, they conducted ceremonies in the catacombs, preaching and holding  communion in some women-only sessions.  During the middle ages they founded the  Great Abbesses which provided an autonomous place for women to study, develop their  art, music, crafts, and science. Many of  the Abbesses and other women religous were  counted on for their counsel;;and scholar-  .  ship.  One of these scholars from England dressed  as a man to be able to study in Athens. In  853 she was made Pope, and soon after  became One of the first martyrs to the cause  of feminine power within the Church. After  a long procession through the streets of  Rome, Pope Joan gave birth and was immediately stoned to death with her baby, and her  memory wiped out of the Church record.  The male theologians were beginning to revive  the misogynist theory that pictured women  as evil beings physically incapable of learning and unsuitable to perform priestly functions. With the destruction of feminine  spirituality and the autonomy of the abbesses, the Church became immersed in the decadence of the male hierarchy.  During the Protestant reformation which  grew in response to this Church, women  Birth  Enhancement  Services  ... Pre/Post Natal Counselling...  Labour Support... Education...  Midwifery Services...  religious became victims of a new kind of  persecution. Those who were not raped or  killed were forced into greater seclusion  from the outside world and into greater  dependence on the leadership of the Church  of Rome.  Life for many did not change very much until  1962 and the Vatican Council of Pope John.  Many women then gave up their compulsory  habit and went back into a ministry in  the community where they combine their  spirituality with social activism.  Over a decade later this activism is beginning to have an impact once again of the  Church hierarchy and on women outside the  Church. Behind the  Veil  is a timely doc-  mentation of the link between women's  spirituality and activism within the Church  and outside. It also speaks of some long-  kept taboos, adding to the discussion  about sex and power from one more silenced  group of women.

This poem brings to mind the one consistent  problem I did have with Mansell's poetry. We  speak, in part, a different language. Man-  sell's culture, idioms, colloquialisms are  different and I am at times aware that I  have missed a crucial meaning and that  subtleties are passing by me because of this  Words like "prang", "dinky-di".

The skill  which Gillean Chase possesses is in  balancing the two.  A substantial part of this collection is love  poems, nearly all to women. It is a book  which celebrates and. explores femaleness  without, for the most part, giving way to  the shallow assumption that all that is  female is inherently-good and beautiful. The  darkness and complexity, the fears and  sorrows of womanhood are explored as well.  The title poem, "Women to the Second Power",  (which ends "Carried to the highest power/  she is only the square root of female.") is  a curious work. On first reading, I thought  it was a particularly cynical view of woman i  in human society. On second reading, it ap- i  peared to be a description of the archetypal,  patriarchal image of woman:  Worshipped and reviled  as madonna of the flowers  and whore  It's a chilling image with no warmth or comfort in it, only suffering and emptiness. This  poem is in considerable contrast to her love  poems which are honest, luminous, sensuous,  passionate, and tend toward compassion rather  than cynicism.  The most successful of her love-poems, "And  Still the Sun", is a two-part contrast of  sunny day and storm; of loving and making  love; of anger and fear. Part 1 concludes  In this rare moment  the sun finds us  streaming through the glass.  We are present |li|p£§f  lifted out of time  and in it, full.  Part II ends with:  After the storm  what is left is anger  and the edge of a thin fear.  Another successful poem, "Obituaries", is  wonderfully blunt and graphic portrait of  Chase's parents. Her mother:  ...had huge ankles  and varicose veins.  . of the human race and the fate of \  In "Forty Days of Rain" Mount St. Helens is  Parthenogenic virgin  she.spews forth  the terrible toothless infant  of our human discontent.

They are instead  full of clever language and sometimes particularly apt and graphic metaphors which nonetheless do not ultimately give these poems the  depth, solidity and character of her love  and portrait poems.  The back cover of the book notes that Chase is  "lTat work on a novel called The Immigrants,  loosely modelled upon the lives of her progenitors." If the few glimpses in this book  of her skill at scene description, character  portrayal, and colorful language are any  indication of what this novel will be like,  I look forward to it.  Head,  Heart & Stone  by Chris Mansell  64pp Fling Poetry: Eltham, Victoria (Australia), 1982  3Tucked inside this book of poems was a letter  from Mansell which proclaims, among other  things, the enviable fact that she is a "full  time writer". It does not reveal how. she pays  the rent, eats, pays her utilities, and other  necessities, except to say that she does teach  creative writing when she can. It's enough to  make any woman writer sigh, voluminously.  Her devotion to her art shows. Her style is  relaxed, witty, deceptively breezy. She is,  like Sharon Thesen, at home among words in  the way that those who live them are. She uses  poetic devices like alliteration, assonance,  repetition of phrases, with apparent ease.  These devices help give the poems a structure  that Gillean Chase's poems sometimes lack.  Fleshing out these structures are the thought  and substance necessary to poems you'd like to  read more than once. One of my favorites in  the witty category is a dissertation "on the  derivation of the expression/ 'pissed as a  parrot'". Entitled "Definition Poem: Pissed  as a Parrot", the poem'follows the poet through  cultivate a manly bum  do not pick your nose  too obviously  The poem concludes with:  14  do not expect breakfast  The title poem takes a subtle shift toward  the serious and imagistic. "Head, Heart &  Stone" is a long, ten part poem which might  best be compared to an expressionist painting. There are recognizable bits strung together in a flow of images whose meaning I  did not always grasp. How much of this was  due to our cultural differences, it was hard  to tell. Much of the poem is enjoyable  regardless of meaning, however, because the  language is skillful and clever:  Do not give me daylight or its kind  relations cooing under domestic eaves.

In the build-up to this event with  over 5,000 women from 160 countries, many  women's periodicals have put out special  international issues. In Canada,- Canadian  Woman Studies  received a grant from the  Canadian International Development Agency  for a beautiful picture-filled spring  edition.  Canadian Woman Studies/les cahiers de la  femme. A York University Project, vol. 6  no. 1. $4.00.  mbject matt,  if the editi  t the hodge  At first glance, the range of global coverage is impressive. Thirty articles in  English and French deal with women in several African and middle Eastern countries,  India, Indonesia, Latin America and Europe.  A number discuss women organizing to improve  their situations in the community, the  workplace, the schools and the fileds. Some  are more theoretical - raising the throny  differences between how women see themselves  and their movement in the west and the third  world.  But this range of geography,  and approach is the weakness  - the diversity seems token i  podge of this collection.  One subset of articles looks at the status  of women within an individual country. As  each of the articles, on Thailand, Sweden,  Greece and Iridia, deals with a different  topic such as changes in the law or workplace, it's difficult ot make comparisons.  You need prior knowledge about each place  to understand the changes that are happening. Imagine the confusions that would  arise if you were to write a three-page  article on the status of women in Canada  for international consumption.  Suma Chitnis's artilce "Feminism in India"  talks about the misconceptions that arise ■  when using a western feminist analysis in  a non-western context. "The contours of  multicultural reality are flattened, some  times beyond recognition". For example,  the western feminist concept of patriarchy  as the central oppressor does not have the  same meaning in India. There, patriarchy  is only one of several hierarchies and has  to be understood within its larger social  context.  As well, it's a context that is so complex  that Indian women traditionally are much  more likely to seek compromise and operate  with "conflicting alternatives in balance"  than use the confrontation-style politics  they read about in the west.  Some of the articles speak of this need to  be sensitive to cross-cultural differences,  whether in developing research, attending  conferences or sharing theory. A few continue western ethnocentrism in their  general sweep of an entire areas' experi-  There are so many subjects dealt with that  it reinforces this superficial understanding . It's rather like being on a two-week  tour of the world. If this is page 16, it  must be Thailand!  The issue might better have concentrated on  one theme. While it is still difficult to  collect material, no longer is there so  little that one edition of even one book  could do this task justice. (Perhaps the  amount of material now available about womer  around the world is one of the greatest  contributions of the International Decade).  The editors of Canadian Woman Studies  would have done well to concentrate on  their area of expertise, women's studies,  or more broadly education and research.  There are a number of articles included  from this viewpoint, although ironically  one of the biggest gaps is about Canada,  as they did not get the information they  solicited.  One group of articles looks at how adult  women are learning new skills to improve  their situation in their own communities,  and the impact they are having on their  relationships with their families and others  around them.

Another song is Music Makes Us  Strong.   That was one of the first ones I  wrote, and it was to a traditional tune.  What i  ■ some of the  lyrics?  I am a travelling woman - I can't remembe:  how it goes. (She begins to sing.)  I am a travelling woman  and I'm learning how to live.  Building up my strengths  giving what I have to give.  I always have been singing  since before I learned to speak;  it helps me find the peace of mind  and wholeness that I seek.  And music makes us strong.  Oh music makes us strong.  Basically, i  singing now,  's the same ;  in a way.  rt of stuff I'i  Then what is different? You?  I don't know what it is that's different.  Now I feel like it's going to be a struggle  all my life. And that we are not going to  achieve exactly what we want in my lifetime,  Yet, I have to keep being aware of all the  shit that goes down in order to not be like  an ostrich. At the same.time, when I go out  to sing, I don't want to get everyone really  down.  I appreciate new wave and punk more than I  did a few years ago. I think it has a lot  to say, and I think it's really important  to sing from your anger. But that's not  my style - to sing of the anger. My style  is just more...well, okay, there's a lot of  crap around and we have to find ways to  feel positive about ourselves.  I think back then, I felt more hopeful and  I felt that we were on the verge of something really wonderful that was going to  change everything overnight. Now I don't  feel that it's going to change overnight.  But I still feel that we have to remain  hopeful in order to live through it. In  order to keep on going. I think that's the  difference there.  I think that without music and art and  dance and theatre in our political work,  it is lifeless. It's dry, cold and it's  dead. We really need that stuff, more than  the speeches. Especially as the struggle  goes on and on and the speeches sound the  same'.- Year after year. When the speeches  start and women turn to their neighbor and  start to talk, or go get a coffee or something... I've seen it happen. So to me it's  very important to have music as part of the  political work we do.  tion is being conducted by women who identify as feminists.  Liisa North writes in "Feminist Currents  in Latin America" about how a group of  middle class women opened a women's centre  in 197-8 in the poorest barrios (neighbourhoods) of Lima, Peru. They offer legal aid,  publish a bi-monthly bulletin and educational leaflets, carry out action research  and organize short courses. The courses  deal with how to meet the most basic needs  of the women in the barrios such as developing women's leadership to improve the  water and sewage systems. A second series  of courses looks at themes Canadian readers  might more easily identify as feminist:  sexuality, the re-evaluation of women,  their social status, historical roles and  personal alternatives.  "A Training Program for Rural Women in  Sumatra Indonesia" looks at how adult  educators are working with women. The emphasis is on developing local group leaders who will learn the participatory  learning techniques of radical Brazilian  educator Paolo Freire. They too try to  analyse local problems and issues and  learn how to come up with self-help solutions. These are two of the approaches initiated by and for women for their empowerment.  There are also other much more conservative  educational programs that affect thousands  of women world-wide. The development of  the women's movement has come at the same  time as the realization of the tremendous  potential labour force that women can provide for rural and urban economic development. Literacy and development programs  are training women for the female job  ghettos. Where women are not actively  organizing themselves in their own intersts,  they are being included in international  plans which will do the opposite. As  Canada and Canadians play an important role  in international development and education,  it's a disappointment that this edition of  Canadian Woman Studies  did not address  some of these problems.  If we are to benefit by the wealth of  women's international experience, there  is a lot for us all to learn. Some of it  challenges our western notions of feminism: of patriarchy, of organizing independently from men, of what is universally  true for all women.' Stories of women  fighting every day for their most basic  survival can inspire us with their courage  and dedication.  Some of the articles and photos in this  special edition present that strength of  spirit, but for the most part the words  are directed to the academic reader.  For those looking to further their international education, this is a disappoint- I Kinesis June 1985  LETTERS  Kill  Slide show  depicts fightback  On May 10 I went to the slide show, Women  Fight Back in B.C. in 1984 and came away  impressed and exhilarated.  On every wall at Women in Focus gallery  were hung long sheets of paper covered with  pictures and newspaper clippings of women's  fightbacks. Stories of the fight against  Jim Pattison and his profits from pornography, stories exposing J. Bob Carter,  stories of individual women fighting  against violence in their lives.  Added to this, five projectors were going  at once, showing slides of yet more women's  actions - the occupation of Christ Church  Cathedral protesting the injunction, this  year's colourful I.W.D.-march, Take Back  the Night, as well as slides of pictures  and posters celebrating women's struggles  around the world.  This show is only the first in a series  of films on women's battles, leading up to  the Take Back the Night March in September.  Other films include P4W (Prison for Women),  and Night Without Fear.  It was a rare feeling being there that  evening, surrounded with the evidence of  so many of our struggles, and the victories  were there too. A great number of women  did fight back against male violence in  1984, and seeing this slide show helped  me realize some of the scope of that fight.  Suzanne Hawkins, Vancovuer.  Group finds  message distorted  Kinesis:  We of the Lavendar Conception Conspiracy  are disappointed with the presentation of  our article in the May issue of Kinesis.  We all think that the graphics and layout  of the article present a negative ijnage  of lesbians and the issues of pregnancy  and parenting.  Here are some of our specific concerns:  •The graphic used was totally inappropriate. It makes no sense and does not have  anything to do with the issues raised.  Its Christian imagery is offensive.to  many of us in the group.  •We gave you a series of quotes to use to  break up the text. You placed all of "them  except one in a box at the top of the  page, as if you didn't know what to do  with them. You could have placed them in  places appropriate to the text. The one  quote -you chose to highlight (with the  dark black box) is the MOST negative of  the ones we gave you. We would have hoped  that if you were going to use only one  quote that you chose one that most accurately reflected the tone of the piece,  which is much more positive and one that  mentioned specific lesbian issues.  •The word lesbian in the title, "Lesbians  Becoming Mothers" is in much smaller and  lighter type than the other words and  takes away from the important fact that  this article is specifically about  LESBIANS and pregnancy.  •The overall effect is disjointed and uninteresting. The black lines and heavy  black type contribute to the negative impression of the article.  We acknowledge Kinesis  is done by volunteers, however, if there was a lack of  experienced production people we would  have appreciated the chance to help out.  It is disappointing to put so much time  and-energy into an article, only to see  its message distorted by bad design.  Sincerely,  The women of L.C.C.  Mother says  thank you  . fire in the woodstove, and  warm and inspired to cook for  I must thank you for 'Mothers: Unpaid and  Exploited' in the May '85 Kinesis.   As a  woman who has been firstly a married at-  home mother, then a married working mother,  then a single welfare mother I am knowledgeable about several different options for  mothers, all of which have their advantages  and disadvantages. For the past few years,,  however,*I have.felt strongly that wages  for motherwork is a solution that has  been sadly neglected by most of the feminist movement. I have been made to feel  like a reactionary, like I am letting  down the cause, for admitting that I  prefer being home with my children (whom  I love) than working in some office with  a bunch of women I have nothing in common  with! Still, when my daughter asked me  the other day, "Is it hard being a Mum?"  I said "Yes". It is all true, the overwork,  the criticism (especially if you are  single) and the lack of understanding from  both feminists and traditionalists, that  this is indeed work and worthy of a decent  wage!  I think that the fight for decent daycare  must go hand-in-hand with an awareness  that women who want to stay home with their  children should have the option to do so -  regardless of their economic status. That  means we should have money of our own for  motherwork, and not be dependent on a  man's (perhaps inadequate) salary and the  powerlessness that goes with that or on  welfare, and the stigma that goes with  that!  It hurts to have to argue this point  with those feminists who insist that work  outside the home is the only valid option  for the modern woman. Don't they see that  they have adopted a very patriarchal  definition of work?  Keep up the good work with your publication. (I got May's from the bookstore,  but am thinking of subscribing.)

However, display would be  permitted so long as warning signs are  In addition to the proposed new section,  the Committee agreed with the demands  made by many women's groups (including  the Working Group on Sexual Violence) that  the hate literature provisions in the  Criminal Code be amended to include womon  as an 'identifiable group' and to make it  easier to prosecute under this section.  The Committee also proposed new sections  to prohibit materials showing anyone who  is or appears to be under the age of  18 engaging in explicit sexual conduct  and to prohibit material which "advocates,  encourages, condones or presents as.normal  the sexual abuse of children".  While the report discusses the possibility  of using provincial Human Rights Codes  to deal with pornography, it concludes  ^that this would be less effective than  creating provincial legislation which  would give the women who were harmed by  pornography the right to sue the pornographers. This kind of legislation could be  modeled along the lines of the Minneapolis  by-law, drafted by Andrea Dworkin and  Catharine MacKinnon, a strategy supported  by the Working Group.  The Committee made various recommendations  for controlling broadcasting and mailing  pornography as well as importation |through  customs. While their recommendations show  a good deal of research into these areas,  they do not define the material which is  not bo be mailed, broadcast or imported.

Broadway  (refreshments)  DATE: Thursday, June 27/85  7:30 pm  Members and Friends of VSW:  show your support by  attending this important  meeting.  NOTICE TO V.S.W. MEMBERS  OF BYLAW CHANGE  Vancouver Status of Women will propose changes of Part 3 #11 of our current bylaws at the Annual General  Meeting, June 27, 1985. The proposal  is to change the year end from May 31  to March 31. The new bylaw would then  read: "the fiscal year shall be April 1st  to March 31st in each year."  Lastly the Committee has proposed a new  federal Secretariat to "stimulate and coordinate efforts" to deal with pornography  and prostitution as social phenomena.  The Fraser Committee has done important  work in gathering together an enormous  amount of research on the topics it  addressed and its members have given the  issues careful consideration. However, it  must be remembered that this is far from  a feminist document. Feminists should read  this report as useful resource material,  but not expect it to provide answers for  It is feminists who have raised the issues  around pornography and it is our work  which forced the government to create this  forum. The compromises suggested by the  Committee are not good enough. They do not  express our understanding of the reality  of pornography and the reality of violence  in women's lives. It is this reality which  we will continue to discuss with each  other and to state out loud whenever we  have the chance. It is not a reality  which is gender-neutral. It is not a  reality to be negotiated. Nor is it one  which needs to be 'proven' by outside  'experts'.  The government wiil no doubt lift out the  recommendations which suits its purpose  and discard those which don't. The  proposed amendments and legal phrases are  already beginning to fly around Ottawa.  Pressure will mount to send women to  'consult', to agree to 'improvements' which  are not good enough, and which we will  later be told were what we wanted.  It is important to remember that this  issue is one on which feminists do not yet  have consensus, one on which right-wing  groups who are not our allies are also  pushing. Legal changes which do not embody  a recognition of pornography as "the  graphic, sexually explicit subordination  of women" will not only fail to address  our concerns, but will also have serious  consequences for the images we produce.  The Fraser Committee report may well result  in a "rush to reform" on the pornography  issue. Unfortunately the report indicates  that feminist concerns are not yet even  on the government's agenda.  Zimbabwe from page 9  The formation of women's leagues has begun  to provide an alternative to strengthen  the women members of the unions and  enables them to fight more effectively  for changes in their working conditions.  These leagues have been formed, in Bulawayo  and Harare, in the United Food and Allied  Workers Union, and in the Harare branch  of the Clothing Union. They represent means  of organizing women to discuss their  problems and to gain confidence and support  before attending meetings. During union  meetings, their representatives encourages  men to elect women to leadership positions  and to organize meetings at a time and  place convenient to women members. Women  are also elected to travel around the  country to organize other women's leagues.  It is hoped that by working together  Zimbabwe's women workers will begin to get  full recognition for the key role they  play in the country's economic development.
