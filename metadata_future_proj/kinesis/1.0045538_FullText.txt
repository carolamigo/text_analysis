Vancouver Status of Women is a nonprofit, non-partisan, registered  society with charitable status. It  has been working with, and for, the  women of British Columbia since 1971.  Founded to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission on  the Status of Women were put into  practice, it continues to help women  gain knowledge of their rights, and  of their own potential.  WHAT DO WE DO?  Vancouver Status of Women:  * provides free ombudservice to  women in crisis  * refers women to agencies that can  help with their specific problem  * conducts "self-help" clinics to  assist women to resolve their legal  problems  * provides extensive research materials on women's issues and history,  unavailable elsewhere  * works to upgrade the status of  women working in the home and in  the marketplace  * provides a monthly newspaper,  Kinesis, for the communication of  ideas and information  * produces a weekly program on cable  10 TV  * trains community volunteers  * makes recommendations to all levels of government, regarding policy  and legislation on family law, education, child care and protection,  violence against women and children, pornography, equal employment  opportunities for women.  DONATIONS TO V.S.W. are  Tax Deductible  WHO USES OUR SERVICES?  * Our services are available to all  women throughout B.C.  * We exchange information across  Canada, and throughout the world, in  order to make it available to all  the women of British Columbia.  DID YOU KNOW THAT  AT V.S.W. in 1977-we   * answered 2244 telephone inquiries  about women's issues in B.C.  * produced 40 television shows  * gave paralegal service to 1107  women  * participated 262 times in skill-  sharing sessions  * took part in 234 "community linkage" activities - speaking engagements, conferences, etc.  * 324 women made use of our research  library resources, in person or by  mail  OUR GRANT APPLICATION  Now, just as we go to press, we  have received word from the Provincial Secretary 's office that  $75,000 has been allocated for  VSW for April 1,  1978 - March 31,  1979 as partial funding for our  ''ñ†ion.  This is half of what we asked for.  It's the same amount that we have  been receiving for three years.  The demand for our services goes  up,  the cost of living goes up,  but VSW goes down. After we received this amount last year, we had  to reduce our staff by one - when  Karen Richardson left the staff,  she was never replaced.  Her tasks  have been shared out, adding a  heavy load to an already overtaxed staff.  We also have a funding application  before Vancouver City Council.  On  March 14,  they rejected by one vote  our appeal for funding for one community worker.  We will be appealing  that decision.  If this appeal fails,  it looks as  if we will be forced to further reduce our staff. This will be a difficult decision to make at a time  when cutbacks in social services in  B.C.  have been causing real hardship  for women and an increased demand for  our services.

"We anticipate further expansion of  the Union in B.   C.  and Saskatchewan  within the next few months",   said  Jean Rands, who was re-elected  National President. "In fact,"  she  said, "the Convention authorized the  National Union to pay for a full-  time organizer for Local  I.     This  will bring to four the number of  paid elected organizers on SORWUCs  staff at the National and Local  and UBW levels. "  "The victory of the Bimini strike is  a further step in our efforts to  organize workers in restaurants,  pubs,  banks,  office and social  service areas,"  added Rands.  BANKS, PUBS, OFFICES, HOMEMAKERS  As well as new organizing possibilities, the Convention heard reports  on contract negotiations going on  for bank workers in both B. C. and  Saskatchewan, and for pub employees,  office workers and Homemakers in  B.C.  The Homemakers are the  employees who provide care offered  by the Provincial.Government's new  Long Term Health Care Programme.  CLC  The Convention endorsed the Executive's recent actions in initiating  discussions with the Canadian Labour  Congress.  Rands said: "Any invitation from the C.L.C.  regarding  affiliation would have to be approved  by all our members in a referendum  ballot."    A United Bank Worker's  delegate from B.C. added that the  U.B.W. had rejected an invitation  from the C.L.C. that the Bank Workers  separate from S.O.R.W.U.C. and join  the C.L.C.'s Bank Organizing  Committee. "We wanted to etay with  our own Union"  said the delegate.  CHILD CARE  The Union's Child Care Committee  Report was enthusiastically endorsed  when it recommended that employers,  governments, unions and the public  support free, 24-hour child care  facilities.  A further recommendation  was that child care workers be paid  on a par with teachers.  RESOLUTIONS  The Convention concluded with the  discussion of a number of policy-  setting resolutions:  * urging changes to provincial and  federal labour laws which would  ease restrictions on the many unorganized working people who would  like to join a union;  * supporting self-determination for  the people of Quebec;  * criticizing proposed federal legislation that will give the RCMP  the right to open mail;  * opposing wage controls in any form  - voluntary or government imposed;  * urging the Federal Government to  grant fishermen the legal right to  collective bargaining;  * supporting International Women's  Day;  * condemning unemployment and  calling for its membership to  negotiate for the shorter work  week and to support the B.C. Federation of Labour's rally in  Victoria on March 30th.  Needed:  NEW RAPE LAWS  In February, a representative of  Coalition of B. C. Rape Crisis  Centres, Lee Stevens, attended a  meeting in Ottawa called by Canadian  Rape Crisis Centres.  The meeting  demanded action by the Federal  Government on legal reform concerning  rape and related sexual offences.  In attendance were representatives  from all Canadian Rape Crisis Centres,  members from the National Association  of Women and the Law, the Advisory  Council on the Status of Women and  Lorenne Clark of the National Action  Committee, also co-author of the  recently published book:  Rape:  The Price of Coercive Sexuality.  The following criteria were listed as  being essential to ensure justice  for victims of rape and indecent  assault:  that:  1. Rape be removed from Part IV of  the Criminal Code entitled:  "Sexual Offences, Public Morals  and Disorderly Conduct".  2. New assault offences be created  to prohibit all acts of forcible  sexual contact.  3. There be no differentiation on  the basis of the gender of the  parties to the offence.  4. The concept that :-hould be  central in differentiating the  specific offence by the.nature  and degree of the risk created;  eg. use of a weapon, extent and  nature of injuries threatened  or inflicted.  5. Removal of the inter-spouse  exemption.  6. Offences should not be differentiated on the basis of whether  or not there was vaginal penetration by a penis.  Such distinctions have served to reinforce  the view that women's value is  determined primarily by their  sexuality and reproductivity.  7. The principle should be firmly  entrenched that women are as  credible as men.  Since the past  sexual history of the complainant has been admissable on the  theory that it goes to the issue  of her credibility, the Canada  Evidence Act and the Canadian  Criminal Code should be ammended  to state clearly that all evidence as to the past sexual  history of the complainant is  inadmissable.  Lobby for jobs  There's well over a million unemployed in Canada today.  Unemployment is higher for  women than for men.  The Greater Vancouver Union of the Unemployed is organizing a massive demonstration  for jobs in front of the provincial legislature March 30 - the first day of the new  session.  Make sure that you take part in this demonstration.  Unemployment is a vital feminist  issue!

Schools, Sexism & Society-  conference a huge success  A student conference on SCHOOLS,  SEXISM AND SOCIETY took place  Friday, February 24th.  The conference was planned and  organized by a committee of B. C.  Teachers' Federation members and high  school students from throughout the  Lower Mainland.  When initial plans  got under way, they were hoping for  200 students.  They got 475.  Student organizer Holly Ferguson  explained the reasons for the  excellent attendance: "Students came  because the topics we 're discussing  are really relevant to our lives.  We're looking at things that aren't  taught every day in school."  Workshops included:  Assertiveness  Training, Rape Relief, Students and  Human Rights, Relating - Male/Female  Contacts, Students:  the Powerless  Majority.  SURREY, LANGLEY TOOK FRIGHT  It was these last two workshops, in  particular, which caused the Surrey  and Langley School Boards to take  fright.  Fears were expressed that  the conference might "Stir up students against tradition."  "We don't  want any political activist group  preaching to our children", said a  Langley trustee.  Ferguson commented: "165 students  from Surrey and 90 from Langley had  expressed an interest in coming to  the conference.    But those Districts  pulled their students out."    Despite  the ban, some Surrey students attended  the conference.  One explained that  the school principal had phoned her  mother to warn her that "there's a  core of propaganda running through  this conference."  And there was a feeling of excitement at the conference.  "I learned  as much today as I learned in school  all last month", one student said.  CONFERENCE - ANNUAL EVENT?  The organizers were pleased with the  success of the conference.  "It's  been a long struggle", said Carol  Gardner, "but now it's here.  Student conferences are important  because it's students who make up  the school.  We should have more  conferences like this, with students  and teachers." Hopes were expressed  by both organizers and participants  that a conference on sexism would  become an annual event.  STUDENTS ENTHUSIASTIC  Students were enthusiastic about the  workshops.  One gave me her impressions of the Rape Relief workshop:  "This is the first time anyone told  me rape should be made into an  assult charge.    It's the first time  anyone told me what to do and what  not to do if I was raped - most of  us don't know,  for example,  that  we shouldn't take a bath right  away.    I think facts about rape  should be taught in a school course.  It shouldn't be left up to a talk  by Rape Relief once a year."  Six students from Burnaby North, a  Lower Mainland school which offers  Women's Studies, gave a workshop  on what Women's Studies is all  about.  Carol Gardner, Janice  Goodrich and Devna Krgovich, all  of Burnaby North, discussed their  impressions of the workshop with me:  "We blew their minds today.     We  concentrated on facts.     We said,  look, we know it's hard for you to  accept facts about the oppression  of women...we never knew how much  oppression there was until it was  brought forward in our course. "  SHOCKED BY OMISSIONS  "The object of our workshop was not  to teach, but rather to show what  students aren't taught.    For example,  students in the workshop were  shocked by the fact that there have  been great Canadian women they 've  never been told about. "  Do students in Lower Mainland schools  know that Women's Studies is available? "I think some students are  afraid of Women 's Studies because  they don't know what is involved",  said Holly Ferguson. -"Also,  many  of them don't know it's available."  Certainly, this day-long conference  was for many students the first  opportunity they had ever had to  find out something about Women's  Studies, and to get excited about  t  &  FEMINISM  WOMEN'S RESOURCES CENTRE NOON HOUR  SERIES FANTASTIC SUCCESS  "Come and hear six Vancouver women  talk about how feminism transformed  their lives", the brochure read.  The Women's Resources Centre, of  UBC's Centre for Continuing Education  was offering a free noon hour series.  The women came-, right enough.  They  came in such numbers that the  Resources Centre had to move the  series from their 1144 Robson  address to the auditorium of the  Vancouver Public Library.  Every Thursday at noon, the women  poured in.  From 200 to 300 women  came for every talk.  They filled  every seat in the auditorium and  they lined the walls.  They ate  lunches, took notes, and asked  questions.  And they heard six  excellent introductions to the  issues of the women's movement.  Speakers were:  Lisa Hobbs, of the  Vancouver Sun; Sue Stephenson, a  psychiatrist; Alix Granger, an  economist; Diana Smith, the BCFW  Lower Mainland Rep.; Sharon Kahn,  Counsellor; and Bonnie Kreps,  writer and film-maker.  Anyone harbouring notions that the  women's movement is dead would have  done well to attend: to listen to  the strength of the six feminist  presentations, and to experience the  energy and sxcitement which the  speakers generated.  If you want to find out more about  the Women's Resources Centre and  their programs, drop in to their  Centre at 1144 Robson. They are  open Monday - Friday 10 a.m. -  4 p.m.; Thursday 10 a.m. - 9 p.m.  Their number is 685-3934.  Some of the student organizers of the conference.  WOMAN KNOCKS RAPIST UNCONSCIOUS  A Coquitlam woman clouted a would-be  rapist over the head with a vase early  today, sending him to hospital.  Coquitlam RCMP said the woman, about  30, was awakened at 2:35 a.m. by a man  who entered her apartment bedroom in  Maillardville and attempted to sexually attack her.  "The woman offered considerable resistance," a police spokesman said. "-She  repelled the attack, rendering the man  unconscious."  In fact, he explained, during a scuffle, the woman picked up a vase and  hit her assailant over the head.  When the police arrived minutes later,  the man was lying unconscious on the  floor.  His intended victim, standing  hearby, had suffered only superficial  bruises, police said.  A Coquitlam  man, 29, is now in fair condition,  under police guard, in Royal Columbian  Hospital.  When he recovers, he will face charges  of attempted rape and breaking and  entering, police said.  (Vancouver Sun, March '78) Betsy Wood and Gay Hoon, two longtime feminist activists in the Vancouver area are facing sentences of  up to life imprisonment in the wake  of a desperate break-out attempt in  late January by five prisoners at the  maximum security B.C. Penitentiary,  the scene of more than a dozen insurrections and hostage-takings in the  past decade.  The charges against Wood, 48, and  Hoon, 32,   are the most serious and  the most arbitrary to confront politically active people on Canada's  West Coast in more than a generation.  Wood and Hoon are best known as daycare and women's workplace organizers  but they have been key figures recently in the campaign to focus attention on the Pen's solitary confinement unit, which prison experts have  called one of the most brutal and  inhuman in North America.  The federal authorities have already  given signs they intend to use the  trial to incite public opinion  against the growing Canadian prison  movement. For instance, they tried  to keep Wood and Hoon in custody  until the trial on the grounds that  they were menaces to society, but  the two activists were finally released on $40,000 bail each after  65 letters of reference were gathered virtually overnight from friends  and acquaintances attesting to their  long-standing pacifist inclinations.  The two are charged with attempted  murder and several other offenses  relating to aiding an escape. The  attempted murder charge, which carries a maximum life sentence, was  laid on the grounds that they bear  equal responsibility because one of  the prisoners stabbed a guard during  a scuffle.  The escape attempt involved five  long-term prisoners who had all  spent considerable stretches in  solitary, including Andy Bruce, who  came to national attention in 1975  during a previous escape attempt in  which prison social worker Mary  Steinhauser (being held hostage by  Bruce and two other prisoners) was  shot to death by the prison tactical  squad.  WOOD  ft  GOTO  TOIAL  Wood and Hoon were present in the  Pen's visiting area when the five  prisoners broke a reinforced glass  partition in their bid to escape.  When the attempt failed, the prisoners took 13 hostages - Wood and  Hoon included - and bargained with  police for a week before finally  giving up peacefully and returning  to custody.  After what turned out to be the  longest-such siege in Canadian prison history, Wood and Hoon were  immediately arrested and charged.  The authorities haven't indicated  yet what their evidence is.  Hoon, who was born and grew up on a  farm in the Fraser Valley, was a daycare worker in Vancouver's West End  who got squeezed out of her job after she attempted to organize herself and her co-workers into the  Service, Office and Retail Workers  Union of Canada, a small independent  union with a strong feminist orientation.  She has since worked on  SORWUC's bank organizing drive and  on the Leonard Peltier defense campaign.  Wood was a working mother for many  years in North Vancouver before getting actively involved in the women's  movement.  She helped organize the  cross-Canada abortion caravan in  1970, and she set up the first day  care for under-threes in East Vancouver .  A preliminary hearing has been set  for June 12 in New Westminster provincial court. If the prosecution  makes out a prima facie (credible)  case, the two will be bound over for  trial, probably in the fall.

Updates  BLISS  The STELLA BLISS APPEAL has now reached  approx. $1,200!  Strong support has been coming in from  organized labour. In the past few weeks,  the appeal has received cheques from  locals of:  CUPE, United Steelworkers of  America, B.C.Interior Fruit and Vegetable Workers Union, United Cement, Lime  and Gypsum Workers, and the IWA.  Thank you, sisters and brothers!  More good news: the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Ottawa, who are acting  as agents for the Vancouver Community  Legal Assistance Society lawyers, has  agreed to donate funds and labour to  the printing costs for the case.  This  will cut down expenses enormously, and  we express our appreciation of their  generosity.  The case itself may be heard in the  sitting of the Supreme Court which commences April 25.

PROSTITUTION  SUPREME COURT RULES ON PROSTITUTION  CASE  In a 9 - 0 decision February 7, the  Canadian Supreme Court squashed the  conviction of a Vancouver woman for  soliciting.  In so doing, they ruled  in favour of a clearer definition of  what the term 'soliciting' means.  Vancouver lawyers Anne Roundthwaite  and Tony Serka argued successfully  before the court that in the absence  of any legal definition of 'soliciting', the word must be understood in  its everyday usage of 'pressing,  persistent conduct.'  WHO WAS SOLICITING WHOM?  Debra Hutt had been convicted of  soliciting after a plainclothes  policeman in an unmarked car claimed  that she had solicited him. The  officer admitted that it was part of  his job to make it appear he was  shopping for sex.  "one wonders", said  Justice Spence, "whether the appeal-  lant solicited any more than the  complaining officer."  Since 1972, prostitution has not been  illegal in Canada, but soliciting has.  Until this Supreme Court judgement,  soliciting has been an extremely  vague term.  PROSTITUTES: ROAMING THE CITY??  Vancouver Mayor Volrich is unhappy  with the results of the Hutt case  because it will make it more difficult  for police to prosecute for soliciting.  The Vancouver Sun (Feb. 21) quoted  him as saying:  "We now have to treat  the situation as an urgent one in  Vancouver...citizens should be able  to walk the streets of the city without being accosted by a large number  of prostitutes roaming around and  staking out territory." March 8, 1908 women garment workers in  New York's Lower East Side marched in  the streets to demand an end to sweatshop conditions.  Two years later Clara Zetkin proposed  that March 8th be set aside as  International Women's Day in celebration  of the march by those garment workers.  The proposal was brought forward in  Copenhagen, at the Second International  Conference of Socialist Women, attended  by about 100 women from 17 countries.  Women, of course, had been militant long  before 1908.  In 1647, for example,  maids in London signed a petition  for the right to a day off, "to shut  up our kitchen doors jfrom eight in the  morning till eight at night every  second Tuesday.  A women's day had been organized for  the first time in the U.S. on February  27th, 1909.  On this day, women held  meetings across the country.  For  example, 3,000 women met in New York  city under the yellow flag of the U.S.  feminists.  They passed resolutions  protesting the non-recognition of  women's right to vote.  The theme of International Women 's  Day this year in Vancouver was  WOMEN AND WORK.  The International  Women 's Day Research Committee produced the following articles about  the themes of this year 's March 8:  Unemployment; Women and Unions,  Wage Controls and other forms of  anti-labour legislation; childcare;  housework; volunteerism.  Kinesis is grateful to the March 8  Committee for permission to reproduce these articles.  They are important, feminist perspectives on  the central part of our lives.  Makara at Info Day, March 5  In Europe, too, the issue of the day  was women's suffrage.  The theme of  the Second International Conference  of Socialist Women was, 'the vote  for women will unite our strength  in the struggle for socialism.'  International Women's Day was to be  a day of world-wide solidarity and  action among women.  In 1911, March  8 was celebrated for the first time  in Austria, Denmark, Germany and  Switzerland.  Quickly, it became  apparent that the right to vote  wasn't the only issue.  Alexandra  Kollontai (1872-1952), a Bolshevik  feminist and member of the Party's  Central Committee, recoounted how  "Germany...and Austria were one  seething, trembling sea of women.  Meetings were organized everywhere.  Halls were packed so full that they  had to ask workers to give up their  places to the women.  This was  certainly the first show of militancy  by the working women.  Men stayed  at home with the children for a  change, and their wives, the captive  housewives, went to meetings."  In  Austria alone, 30,000 women and men  marched and demonstrated in the  streets.  In 1913, women in Czarist Russia  celebrated International Women's Day.  Even though it was forbidden to hold  meetings women of the Petrograd  Bolshevik Party organized a public  forum, which was well-attended.  At  the end of the meeting, the police  arrested the main speakers.  March  8, 1917, heralded the beginning of  the revolution when women textile  workers poured into the streets  demanding bread.  By the end of the  day there were 90,000 women and men  demonstrating.  March 8 has continued to be a significant day for women.  In 1970, it  was celebrated in Uruguay by an all-  women jailbreak, organized by the  Tupamaros.  On March 8, 1977, over  8,000 Spanish factory workers demonstrated for equal pay, abortion, and  contraception.  7,000 people marched  in Belguim.  Women in Liverpool,  England, occupied their factory, with  support from other workers.  March 8th is celebrated as a public  holiday in socialist countries, with  varying degrees of fervour.  Here in  Canada, the day has re-emerged with  the women's movement. (Thanks to The  Other Woman and Socialist Voice)  Students at Information Day 6   the issues of  March 8  UNEMPLOYMENT  In the past thirty years there has been  a major shift in the nature of the  Canadian labour force.  The unemployment  statistics reflect this.  In 1947, the  Canadian economy was experiencing a boom  which ensured the maintenance of  relatively full employment.  That year  the unemployment rate for women was 1.7%  and 2.9% for men.  With the rapid  expansion of the service sector this  trend of lower unemployment for women  continued.  In 1967 the rate was 3.0%  for women and 4.6% for men.  In the middle seventies the economy  began to decline.  The non-industrial  sector of the economy was hardest hit;  as a result the government cutback  spending in the education, social  during World War II, women have  traditionally entered the w orkforce.  In periods of recession, however,  they are forced out of the workforce  and back into the family.  Cutbacks  in social services also force women  out of the workforce.  Daycare is  either no longer available or is  simply far too expensive for the  average working parent.  In the  1973 Childcare survey 40% of the  mothers wishing to involve themselves  in the workforce gave the absence of  satisfactory childcare as one of the  major reasons.  ''hidden unemployed".  Of the hidden  unemployed, young people accounted  for 38% and adult women for 41%.  If the hidden unemployed were added  to the official figures the unemployment rate for women in 1976 would  have been 14.5% instead of 8.4%.  When the hidden unemployed are added,  unemployment among young women (15-24)  turns out to be higher than that for  young men; that is 18.1% for the  former as opposed to 17.7% for the  latter.  Taking "hidden unemployment"  into account, the true rate of unemployment among adult women is 110%  higher than it is among adult men.  (L) Woman signing up for the March 30 rally of the unemployed at the B.C. Legislature.  (R)  Vancouver Status of Women's float in the March 8 parade, with a working mother.  The float questioned myths which are used to exclude women from the workforce -  "She only works for pin money", for example. It also outlined,  in poster form,  some of the basic rules of economic discrimination :  "Last Hired, First Fired" etc.  services and hospital spheres.  These  are the areas where women workers are  concentrated.  In 1975, for the first  time, the unemployment rate was higher  for women than for men.  It was 8.1%  for women and 6.2% for men.  The  January 1978 "statistics continue to  reveal this trend.  The unemployment  rate for women was 10.8% and for men  it was 9.3%.  In the same month the  construction, retail and wholesale,  and service occupations had extremely  high rates of unemployment.  The unemployment rate for adult women  is 60% higher than it is for adult  men.  Women are prone to unemployment  because of their concentration in the  service sector of the economy.  However, the reason is much more  fundamental and reflects women's  role in the family.  When the  economy is booming, as for instance,  Unemployment is severe among young  people and women over 25.  In October  1977, 14.1% of women and 15.3% of men,  both in the 15-24 age category, were  unemployed.  Over 25, the rate was  7.7% for women and 4.8% for men.  'Ģ Unemployment among young people is  2 1/2 times higher than it is among  adults.  Officially, unemployment is defined  as those persons who are actively  looking for work or who have been  working in the past twenty-six weeks.  This ignores women who are not working  because of family responsibilities,  lack of daycare, or lack of skills.  H.L. Robinson, in his article "A  Secondary Majority", pointed out that  these statistics fail to take into  account the 500,000 or more women  and men who have stopped looking for  work.  These people constitute the  In periods of high unemployment the  state uses women as scapegoats for  all economic problems.  The employers  and the government are perpetuating  the attitude that "women are taking  men's jobs.  With 85% of single  parent families headed by women, it  is clear that women are working out  of economic necessity.  Women have to call for full employment.  They have to fight against  cutbacks.  They have to call on the  government to establish job-making  programs.  Finally, women have to  call on the trade union movement to  organize the unorganized.  On  March 30, 1978, the B. C. Federation  of Labour is sponsoring a rally which  will be held in Victoria, and which  will focus on unemployment.  please attend!!   show your support  for the rights of women and all  unemployed!! Women and Work  UNIONIZE  In 1886 a prominent Toronto trade    \ i>K  union organizer made a Labour Day     \  |w  speech calling for equal pay and equal i! ;{\  work. While the union movement has  made certain very important gains in  terms of women, they have not lived  to the spirit of this statement  Unions were originally organized  and for skilled workers. Therefore  women were traditionally excluded from  them. Unions were based on the mining, transport and construction industries , not in the laundries and textile mills. The American Federation  of Labour which spearheaded this organizing drive rationalized their  failure to organize women by saying  that they did not organize unskilled  workers. During the CIO organizing  drive of the 30's and 4C's, the status  of women changed as the union movement became stronger and began to  orientate away* from craft (skilled)  unions, to industrial (unskilled)  unions.  Working for  Pin Money  Union leaders have been loathe to organize women because they have felt  that women only work for 'pin money'.  Union leaders have felt that women's  work is marginal to this society.  The fact that women work in small  isolated workplaces has also worked  against their organization by the traditional unions. Women mainly work in  the non-industrial sectors of the  economy. They do not have the same  economic clout as do workers in the  industrial sector. This has made  large unions reluctant to organize  them. Finally, large scale organization of women workers would force the  trade union leaders of this province  to take on a concerted challenge of  sexism within society and within the  ranks of the labour movement.  In 1972 there were 2,580,000 women and  4,731,000 male workers in the Canadian  labour force. Among them, 575,504  women and 1,801,617 men were members  of unions.  Also, in 1972, 22.3% of women and  38.1% of men workers were union members. The highest proportion of women  union members were in the public administration field in which union  membership was held by 59.8% of the  female workers. For men, this occurred in the construction field where  65% of male workers were union members .  The lowest proportion of male  and female unionized workers occurred  in the agricultural sector.  Women constitute 24.2% of total union  members, this proportion ranges from a  high of 58.4% in the service sector to  a low of .4% in the construction  industry. The number of women union  members increased 78.4% from 1966 to  1972.  7   %\ i  I ;      i  In 1976, 34.6% of B.C. working women  were union members. Half of these  women belonged to unions which were  affiliates of the Canadian Labour  Congress (CLC). This includes unions  such as the Canadian Union of Public  Employees (CUPE), Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), Office and  Technical Employees Union (OTEU),  Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union  and the Retail Clerks International  Association. The three B.C. unions  which have the largest female membership are outside the CLC. They are  the Registered Nurses' Association of  B.C., the B.C. Teachers Federation  and the Hospital Employees Union.  Each has a majority of women members  and between them they include close  to 50,000 women.  Independent  Unions  A new trend has emerged in the unionization of women workers. This is  small independent unions which are  mainly oriented towards women. At  UBC and SFU the Association of University and College Employees is leading  the way.  Service, Office and Retail  Workers of Canada has played a major  role in organizing bank workers.  It  also has organized in areas where the  workers are highly vulnerable to the  encroachment of the boss (neighbourhood pubs, fast-food chains, small  offices and social service agencies).  The significance of this unionization  cannot be underestimated.  Unions are very important for working  women. They give women a chance to  have their (our) skills properly recognized and paid for, decent maternity  leave, sick leave rights and control  over working conditions as well as  protection over the arbitrary actions  of the boss. When banded together,  union women can more effectively fight  for equal pay and for equal work, for  24-hour-day quality child care, for  jobs, and against anti-worker anti-  women legislation. Unions are the  most important way in which women can  win decent pay and have some defense  against the boss and the government.  WOmen  Unions do not adequately deal with the  problems and needs of women. Too  often does the union leadership only  superficially recognize the aforementioned . Women hear the argument time  and again that all workers are equal  trade union members. Women are unrepresented relative to men at all levels  of trade union activity.  1972: total executive board members  of unions, women executive board  members and women executive board  members as % of total executive board  members:  Type of union  total Executive  board members  INTERNATIONAL  132  NATIONAL  460  GOVERNMENT  413 _  TOTAL  1,005  Women executive  % of women  board members  exec, board members  5  3.8%  65  14.1%  24  5.8%  94  9.4%  Changes  Although it is still very difficult  for women to participate in unionsx  the situation is changing. The CLC  recently held a national education  conference directed towards the needs  of women union members. The B.C. Federation of Labour has set up its own  women's committee and has urged its  affiliates to do likewise. Unions  such as the BC Government Employee's  Union, CUPE, IWA and OTEU have their  own Women's Committees. The impact  of SORWUC in making both union members and leaders aware of the problems of working women has been  enormous. Women are slowly emerging  from the passive role we have been  condemned to play in unions. The  latest convention of the B.C. Federation of Labour considered these  motions: 8  women   and work  Women & Unionism cont'd  1) that the BC Fed view the following  as the minimum standard in Maternity  Protection:  a) reinstate in the same or comparable position with no reduction  in benefits  b) pre and post-natal leave must be  deemed continuous for the purpose  of pensions,  UIC contributions and.  other benefits  2) that the BC Federation of Labour  demand that the provincial government  set up Rape Relief Centres throughout  B.C. with a regular and ongoing source  of funding  3) that the BC Fed urge affiliates to  consider widow's benefits when  negotiating pension plans  4) that the BC Fed demand that the  provincial government develop an  active program for the removal of  sexism in school curricula.  Unions are the largest bodies of organized workers in Canada.  In this  capacity they can begin to fight  against wage controls, unemployment,  and so on.  Although unions are far from ideal, it  is important that women join them.  The trade union movement must undertake a massive campaign to organize  women workers. By means of Women's  Committees women must fight to ensure  that the trade union movement deal  with our specific needs.  Major questions face the trade union  movement today. This includes the  response to wage controls and tripar-  tism. One of the important questions  is the status of SORWUC. At present,  the CLC has set up a one million  dollar organizing fund to reach bank-  workers. The allocation of this money  will require a major debate on how  best to organize the banks.  On October 14,-1975, the Federal Finance  Minister introducted BILL C~73 " THE  ANTI-INFLATION ACT ~ into Parliament.  This bill is designed to make workers  pay for and bear the brunt of inflation.  For low paid workers, many of whom are  women, the imposition of wage controls  has stymied their struggle to win  equality in the work force.  Women  suffer from the effects of this legislation because their wages are frozen  at already inequitable levels.  The  meager percentage allowed by the AIB  for wage increases hurts women workers  as it serves to widen the wage gap  between them and make workers.  Six  percent of $6.00 is 36C, but 6% of  $3 is only 18$.  Wage control legislation aims to destroy  collective bargaining.  This is the  only means women have to eliminate  wage inequalities and job ghettoes.  Although wage control legislation  provides exemptions for additional  increases for women who have suffered  wage discrimination in the past, women  are faced with the ludicrous situation  wherein their employers are required  to place each case for equal rights  before the AIB; that is, those who  also benefit from the discrimination  of women.  tripartism  The Canadian Labour Congress's response  to Bill C-73 is the "Labour Manifesto".  The central feature of this proposal  is tripartism.  Tripartism is based on  the principle that workers have the  same interests as governments and  bosses, and that collaboration between  these three parties will solve all  Canada's economic woes.  Tripartism  makes unions mere arms of the state,  willing collaborators in their own  oppression.  It destroys the ability  of unions to fight back and/or to  protect the gains which they have  already won.  For women this means  that unions will no longer be able  to fight for equal pay, for better  maternity leave and for decent  working conditions.  Tripartism  is contrary to the interests of  all working people.  Most C.L.C. unions, including  C.U.P.E. and C.U.P.W., have rejected  the Labour Manifesto.  Instead of  establishing a partnership between  labour, government and business,  working women have to call upon  organized labour to develop and  adopt a militant fight-back stategy.  The proposed legislation replacing  Bill C-73 is the proverbial wolf in  sheep's clothing.  It will change  nothing.  DOMESTIC   AND FARM   WORKERS  Exploitation is upheld and condoned  by the. preservation of a bottom  stratum of workers who absorb the  shocks of the system for the rest.  Domestic workers, along with farm  workers, have long been part of the  bottom stratum.  In economic terms,  as the lowest stratum of workers,  these people form a valuable last-  resort labour pool. Workers from  more established sectors of the economy can and do cut into the jobs of  these low-wage workers in times of  recession.  Since no statistics are  kept on domestic or farm workers, they  are truly invisible when pushed out  of all they have - low-wage, seasonal, and part-time labour. Real unemployment is hidden. If the effect of  the present exclusion of domestic and  farm workers from labour standards  legislation is to discriminate against  women and ethnic minorities, as the  Human Rights Commission has stated,  then the situation must be corrected  immediately.  no protection  According to the Department of Labour,  there are roughly 3,000 full-time and  part-time domestic workers in B.C.,  nearly all women. This estimate is  undoubtedly low, but no other figures  are available. Domestic workers are a  highly invisible sector of the labour  force.  Women are domestic workers for diverse  reasons.  They may be single-support  women who are without skills to obtain  better-paying jobs, or who need the  flexibility of part-time work to care  for children; immigrant women who face  language barriers to other types of  work; foreign women on work visas,  generally hoping (unrealistically) to  become landed immigrants; or women  earning a second, undeclared income  for their families.  The number of casual farm workers in  B.C. is not known - one estimate of  farm workers in the lower mainland is  6,000-8,000, of which more than 50%  are women.  The majority of casual  farm labourers work only 4-6 months  of the year, and almost all depend  on unemployment insurance benefits  for at least 4 months of the offseason.  The incidence of poverty  among farm worker families is 24.9%;  among all workers, the incidence is  much lower, 11.4% of families.  As with domestic workers, farm workers are not yet vocal on their own  behalf.  Farmers, on the other hand,  have voiced major opposition to the  inclusion of casual farm workers  under labour standards legislation.  In 1970, the Royal Commission on the  Status:of Women reported that domestic workers had "little protection,  no occupational standards, no unions  or other organizations". This is  largely true today for both domestic  and farm workers.  Labour standards are minimum standards  set by the government to ensure workers a basic wage and decent working  conditions. Most workers today take  these minimum standards for granted,  and look upon them as a right. Yet  historically (and unfairly), domestic  and farm workers have been excluded  from the protection of labour standards legislation.  Labour standards legislation must be  amended to include domestic and farm  workers. Legislatively, the change  entails simply deleting those provisions specifically excluding these  workers from the various Acts dealing  with labour standards legislation. 9  women  and work  ANTI- LABOUR  LEGISLATION  As the economic crisis sharpens the  government steps up its attacks on  working people.  The following is a  partial list of such attacks.  BILL 65 — A provincial bill which  mandated the closing of the Vancouver  Resources Board.  This jeopardizes those  social services relied upon by women,  minorities, handicapped, and children.  It decertified three unions which  represented VRB employees.  It reflects  the attitude of the Socred government  whose concern is not the people of this  province but finances.  BILL 68 — This provincial bill contained  a blatant union-busting clause.  The  clause terminated the collective agreement between Notre Dame University and  the Faculty Association (A.C.T.E. 1728)  and abolished, quite arbitrarily, the  union itself.  BILL 80 — The Provincial Labour Code  Amendments Act.  It changes the  definition of 'employee' to exclude  all workers who have any advisory role  in the development or the exercising of  any management or supervisory functions.  The Code previously only excluded those  employees who were employed for the  primary purpose of exercising management functions.  All workers who deal  in a confidential way with any matters  relating to personnel are now excluded  from the definition of 'employee'.  The Code previously only excluded those  who were employed in a confidential  manner to deal with labour relations  matters.  These amendments will not  only exclude large groups of workers,  especially women, from bargaining  rights, but will likely result in the  loss of existing rights for many union  members.  The unfair labour practices  section has also been altered making  organizing in many cases virtually  impossible.  The new Act states that  an employer cannot be denied the right  to 'communicate' to an employee a  statement of fact or opinion reasonably held with respect to the employers  business.  This gives the employer the  right to propagandize among employees  during organizing drives.  The new  Act takes away from the union the  power to prevent the altering around  of job descriptions, etc. initiated  by an employer during organizing  drives.  The employer can now alter wages and  terms and conditions of employment  during organizing drives.  Unions  also lost the right to employee lists  during such a drive.  The Act changed the percentage needed  for application or certification.  Instead of 35% the Code now requires  that 45% of employees are signed up  before an application for certification.  The Act gives the Labour Relations  Board the right, where "perishable  goods" are involved to extend strikes  or lockout notices to an indefinite  period.  When slightly over 1/3 of the B. C.  workforce is unionized, any curtailment of organizing is criminal.  The  unorganized are mainly poorly paid  women.  THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES ACT — This  provincial bill gives the government  the right to make strikes illegal if  they jeopardize the economic well-  being of the province.  BILL C-27 ~ EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION  REORGANIZATION ACT. This federal act  curtails eligibility for UIC and the  length of benefits available. The  basic minimum qualifying period is  changed from 8 to 10-14 weeks, depending  on the regional level of unemployment  Total allowable benefits have been  reduced from 51 to 50 weeks. Many  women work on a temporary or casual  basis. The change in qualifying  periods will deprive them of UIC  benefits.  BILL C-24 — IMMIGRATION ACT. This  federal act is racist and broadens the  already too-wide powers of the Immigration officers.  It allows for  arbitrary deportations, increased  surveillance, and private deportation  hearings.  The act allows the  Immigration officers to deport any  immigrant who goes on welfare.  It is  intended to prevent immigrants from  participating in political, union,  ethnic, women's or self-defence  activities.  It allows for unspecified  terms to be imposed on new immigrants.  The provisions of this bill seem to  further condemn immigrant women workers  to low-paid job ghettoes.  Immigrant  women, will not be able to protect  themselves from the arbitrary actions  of the boss without jeopardizing their  status.  Two bills which have not yet been  presented in legislation form are also  dangerious to working women.  RIGHT-TO-WORK LEGISLATION — This has  been threatened by the Socred government.  It will give workers the right  to receive union benefits while they  undermine the union.  Fundamentally,  it is a right to scab bill.  Right to  work legislation gives the "right"  to work long hours at low pay, to  employers to hire women to do the  same work as men for less pay, and  the "right" to refuse to hire or  promote workers because of their  race, religion, sex, union or  political activity.  It is antiunion legislation.  AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE STAFF  RELATIONS ACT — The act covers all  federal civil servants.  The aim of  this legislation is to "reconcile  the interest of employed persons in  improving the terms and conditions of  their employment with management's  interest in obtaining operational  efficiency".  It gives non-union  members the right to vote on strike  and contract matters.  It essentially  confers full union benefits upon  scabs.  It prohibits the union from  striking over technological change.  It also gives Parliament the right __  to deem strikes illegal and for their  own body, the Public Servants Staff  Relations Board to astronomically  fine participants in a strike.  It  also gives the employer the right to  remove union officers from their  positions for participating in any  way in an illegal strike.  It is aimed  to break unions in the federal civil  service, an area where many women  are concentrated.  All these pieces of legislation attack  workers and their hard won rights.  Rather than attacking the true source  of inflation, the government attacks  workers.  Women must join together  with unions, etc. to defeat these  bills. 10          the issues off March 8  Introduction  The provision of day care services is  in an issue which has a long and com-  ^plex history, particularly in B.C.  It  is an issue which affects large num-  'bers of people (mostly women), and it  is one of the areas where a great deal  of agitation has occurred, with some  gains achieved, and ultimately where a  great deal has been lost.  Ad-hoc  committees have formed to write reports, demonstrate, lobby, and generally agitate around day care issues in  B.C. for a number of years, and essentially that impetus has now been lost;  those in the women's movement who have  spent years working for quality day  care on demand are now watching the  situation reverse itself, slowly but  surely.  For these reasons, it is crucial that the issue of day care be  closely examined, so that we do not  lose what few services we now have,  and so that we can take concrete steps  to further the struggle for universal  day care: quality day care, around the  clock, for those who need it.  behind  Day care in Canada is 25 years behind  the times...it is grossly inadequate.  Tnere a,re approximately 2,614,000  children under the age of 16 with  working mothers;  275,000 of these are  under the age of 3,  and 345,000 aged  3-5.     Yet in the entire country there  are no more than about 83,000 places  for children in supervised day care.  (Eileen Morris, "Who Will Mind the  Children?", Homemaker's Magazine,  Fall  1977)  In B.C., full day services fall into  two categories: group day care, and  family day care. Half-day services  consist of nursery schools and kindergartens (pre-Grade 1).  It is primarily full day services that will be  dealt with here. The Provincial Child  Care Facilities Licensing Board is  responsible for licensing day care  centres, and each type of centre has  its own set of regulations, including  health, fire, electrical, plumbing,  and building inspections. A provincial Day Care Information Centre exists to unravel the complexities of  licensing regulations and the subsidy  programme. The centre opened in February of 1973-, but shortly afterwards  women held an eleven-day sit-in there  to demand community controlled, acces-  ible child care. Although both the  Licensing Board and the Information  Centre were committed in theory to  providing these services, it is obvious that this commitment was not  being fulfilled. At this point, the  regulations are still a horrendous  maze. Since the Social Credit Government came to power in late 1975, serious changes in child care policy  have been instituted, resulting in a  situation where group day care is  almost a luxury which most people  cannot afford.  i S3 Sh  As of 1975, some interesting trends  can be noted in day care across Canada. First, the increase in numbers of  centres is well short of the previous  year.  Second, the trend is toward  serivces for the 3-5 age group: only  4.34% of children under three of working mothers were in day care. Yet the  percentage of children aged 3-5 of  working mothers who were in day care  was 17.22% - double that of the previous year. The highest growth rate  (167.92%) for type of service was  family day care (i.e. one woman looking after up to seven children in her  home, with no back-up staff or insurance , and for a very low income).1  The meaning of these trends is reflected in B.C. consistently: more complex  and restrictive licensing and subsidy  procedures mean a lower growth rate,  which is then used by those in power  to demonstrate a lessening of demand;  less services for younger children,  reflecting the attitude that they are  the mother's responsibility alone; and  an increase in family day care — the  cheapest service, and the most exploitive.  problems  The most pressing problems in the  'vy care system in B.C.  are:  1. There are no block grants given to  day care centres based on the centre 's  budgeted needs; rather, income is tied  to the subsidy system, which is based  on enrollment and which assumes full  enrollment at all times.    This is unrealistic, because enrollment is continually fluctuating; this is a natural occurrence, and is the experience  of all day care centres.    Thus, centres often operate in the red, and  wages for day care workers are correspondingly low.  2. The subsidy programme does not  allow nearly enough parents to qualify.    For example,  full time students,  sponsored or nominated immigrants, and  welfare recipients are not eligible  for day care subsidies.    Subsidies  are available only to those who are  already working.    Also,  the subsidy  rates are far too low.  3.  Finally, government regulations,  statements and actions on the subject  of day care reflect the attitude that  day care is not a right,  but a privilege; further,  the changing nature of  the family unit is not recognized  (particularly working mothers and  single-parent families) certainly not  in a positive or supportive manner.  The most recent and regionally relevant report to come to light is  Daycare:  1977,  submitted to the Vancouver Resources Board in June, 1977  by the ad-hoc committee on the status  of day care, headed by Alderwoman  Darlene Marzari. The report is based  on certain premises, which include  the right of every woman to work and/  or actively contribute to society, and  the right to expect the best possible  care for children. One of the conclusions drawn in the report is best put  by Aid. Marzari:  Day care cannot grow up to be a  strong,  supportive community service  while battered by financial difficulty,  insecurity, and stuffed into the  indelicate category of '^public  assistance"... We 've got to start looking at quality day care as a  right".  {The Vancouver Sun,  September, 1977)  J don 't care whether the parent works  or doesn't work; if a day care centre  is the best place for the child,  then  that is where the child should be.  The new regulations use the child as a  monetary unit.    This may be the space  age,  but for women and children it's  still thje dark age.     (Interview with  Bridie Mcllwraith, B.C. Preschool  Teacher's Association)  In 1966-67, the B.C. government instituted a policy of provincial funding  for day care, based on a sliding scale  subsidy system. Today, the subsidy  system is a citizen's nightmare, but  basically it works like this:  Day care subsidies are eligibility-  based, not only on proven financial  need, but also on proven social need.  There are tests available for each of  these criteria, which require thorough  documentation and which outline what  is acceptable in the way of legitimate  expenses. The present ceiling on the  subsidy scale is $140 for centres and 11  women  and   work  $100 for family day care per month  per child, but there is no longer any  ceiling on what the centre may charge,  except that the fee for every child  must be the same. Most centres need  to put a surcharge on top of the subsidy fee to meet costs, but what is  worse is that day care workers rarely  benefit through a raise in pay because  the centres themselves simply cannot  afford it.  The most crucial discrepancy in the  subsidy system is that the sliding  scale is not tied to the cost of  living in any way. At the moment,  many people who need the subsidy earn  too much to receive it, although what  they earn may be barely adequate to  cover their living expenses. Daycare:  1977  submitted as a part of their report to the VRB a new subsidy scale,  tied more closely to realistic income  and expenses, but there has been no  move by the government to implement a  new scale.  absolute  necessity  We will not move very far if we confine ourselves to thinking of day care  only for special groups of people in  society.     We need to plan this service on a broad basis,  so that it is  available to all families who need  and want to make use of it.   (Roslyn  Burshtyn, Proceedings of the Canadian  Conference on Day Care, June, 1971)  What is needed in the area of day care  is some very strong moves based on  the premise that day care is a necessity in this society. The social  attitudes about women and children  which have brought about the present  dilemma in day care are ultimately  the same attitudes upon which the  total oppression of women is based.  So long as women are seen as sexual  objects whose primary occupation is  to bear and raise children, quality  day care will never become a reality.  At its founding convention in 1974,  the B.C. Federation of Women declared,  "(Our) goal is the creation of high  quality, non-sexist, 24-hour a day  child care, available and accessible  to all children from infancy onwards,  in all parts of the province." If the  rights of women and children are to be  recognized, then this attitude must  underly all efforts toward improving  day care, not only in B.C. but across  the country.  Day care,  in the broadest sense of  the term,  should be regarded, first,  as  a right for children and mothers.,  as a positive alternative to the 24  hours a day,  seven days a week care  expected of women who have children in  this society.     (Cuz There Ain't No  Daycare  (Or Almost None) She Said,  Press Gang, 1973)  (Info from Update on the Status of  Women in British Columbia, 1978.  HOUSEWORK  Housework is a form of women's labour  which is ignored by society, despite  the fact that without it, the wheels  of this society would grind to a  standstill. Domestic labour maintains the workforce necessary for today's economy, at no cost to the government or to industry. Women prepare  food, clean clothes, care for and  produce  young children, give emotional  and sexual support to their partners,  maintain the home, and teach children  basic social norms.  unpaid labour  This work is unpaid labour. Within  this society (which runs on profit)  the woman's unpaid labour, although  resulting in her isolation and unhap-  piness, appears as rational: it excuses the government from providing  services which would lessen the burden  of women and allow us to participate  equally in the workforce.  The role of women as domestic workers  is seen as our primary task. We are  taught that this is our future from  our very first experiences. We are  given dolls to care for, and also  taught to orientate our attitudes and  appearance to be appealing to men, our  future mates.  Women are used as a reserve labour  force; in other words: when the economy is healthy and expanding, we are  pulled into the workforce. Because  our main job is to raise families, we  are paid less wages than men and condemned to work at jobs which are extensions of our role within the family — nursing, teaching, organizing,  cleaning, waitressing, or unskilled  factory work. As soon as the economy  is in crisis, we are forced out of  the workforce. The home is again used  as an excuse. This time, we are told  that we are taking work away from men  with families to support and that we  have deserted our proper sphere: the  home. Despite the fact that women  have become a more permanent part of  the labour force, this rationale is  still applied today.  If the services  within the home which we provide were  provided by society, such an excuse  would be unthinkable.  In a sense, but a limited one, the  work which we do is  paid for.  If we  do not work, our husband's wage is  expected to cover the entire needs of  the family. Our role is to budget it  to do this. The relationship which is  created between ourselves as women and  our husbands reproduces the inequalities of this society, our husband is  like our boss; we are economically  dependent upon him for survival.

The Information Day was attended by  over 500 people and focussed on the  issue of WOMEN AND WORK. A 4 page  program listed about 30 workshop  choices including Organizing the  Unorganized Workers, Immigrant Women,  Domestic and Farm Workers, Lesbians  and Employment, Women in the Trade  Union Movement, Women in Chile,  Jamaican Women, Women and the Unemployment Crisis, and Women in Prison.  Films and slide shows were presented  throughout the day, groups sang and  played instruments, and information  booths lined the main cafeteria,  stacked with books and pamphlets and  decorated with banners and placards.  Frances Wasserlein, a member of the  International Women's Day Organizing  Committee, said the Information Day  was a great success.  "The women's  movement is not dead - we're here to  prove it and we're looking forward  to a successful parade through downtown Vancouver on March 8th."  And a successful parade it was! Far  surpassing organizers expectations,  said one member of the organizing  committee.  On foot, horseback, roller skates,  bicycles, cars and trucks, 800 women,  children, and male supporters paraded  along Georgia Street from Bute to the  Queen Elizabeth Theatre. Women carried huge white sacks lettered with  "Unpaid housework, Unwanted pregnancies", pushed babystrollers, handed  out feminist fortune cookies, carried  placards and banners reading "Rape is  War", UIC Discriminates Against Women",  "Pink Collar Workers", "Women are the  last hired and first fired", "Women  Loving Women", and "Erase Sexism from  Education".  A major feature of the parade was a  large banner demonstrating the double-  work day women face. Women were portrayed sewing in the sweat-shop by day  and sewing at home after the children  had been put to bed.  Groups participating were women's  bookstores, women's groups such as  Rape Relief, Downtown Eastside Women's  Centre, V.S.W., Women's Resource  Centre, Women's Research Centre, university women's groups, B.C. Federation  of Women, SORWUC, AUCE, Press Gang,  Makara, Prisoner's Rights Group, Revolting Women, In Struggle, Revolutionary Workers League, Gay Alliance  Toward Equality, and committees for  the defence of human rights in Chile,  the Phillipines, and South Africa  among 30 other participating  organizations.  Provincially, International Women's  Day actions took place in Prince Rupert,  West Kootenays, Okanagan-Kamloops, the  Fraser Valley, the Sechelt Peninsula,  and various other parts of the province. Actions ranged from information  booths, pamphletting, film showings,  and workshops.  M  A  RS  H  <00SKr  *~»«    j  International Women's Day was celebrated in Toronto with, a 2 hour Rally at  Convocation Hall, University of Toronto,  followed by a long march through the  cold and slush-covered city streets  by 1500 demonstrators.  Speakers at the Rally demanded equal  job and salary opportunities, lesbian  rights, abortion on demand, and fair  rape trials.  They denounced proposed  cutbacks in Ontario's social services  and protested the deportation of  Jamaican immigrant women.  Carolyne Egan, a member of the International Women's Day Coalition and an  organizer of the march, criticized  the social service cutbacks in the  Ontario government's new budget.  Sherona Hall, speaking for the Committee against the Deportation of Jamaican Women, said that Jamaican mothers  - landed immigrants ■»  are being "held  ransom for government mismanagement."  The Rally voted unanimously to demand  that federal Minister of Employment  and Immigration, J.S.G. Cullen, rescind  the deportation orders against all the  Jamaican mothers charged with unlawful  entry into Canada.  Following the noon-hour Rally, demonstrators marched in the largest women's  march ever held in Toronto. About 1000  women and children began the march and  over the progress of the 2 hour walk  the numbers swelled to 1500.  In Montreal, a crowd of 2,000 marched  through the east end of the city in a  parade organized by Quebec's three  main labour organizations -- the Confederation des Syndicats Nationaus,  the Federation des Travailleurs du  Quebec, and the Corporation des  Enseignants du Quebec.  The marchers demanded paid maternity  leave, abortion on demand and equal  pay for equal work for women.  In Ottawa, 400 persons rallied on  Parliament Hill and then marched  through downtown with a list of 23  demands to improve the status of  women. Some of the demands were  equal pay for equal work, abortion on demand, free daycare and  instituting International Women's  Day as a statutory holiday.  At the Parliament Hill Rally, Dodie  Zerr of the Vancouver-based Service,  Office and Retail Worker's Union  (SORWUC)said the economic status of  women has increased only slightly  in the last century.  In Winnipeg, an International  Women's Day Rally was held at the  Legislative Buildings on March  8th.  On Saturday, March 11th, a  information day was held focussing  on topics such as -daycare, violence against women, justice in  the work place, housing, family  law reform and wages for housework. 14   women and work  cont.   from p.11  housework  today's inflation, the pressure is  greater: the family's economic resour^  ces are limited and the pressure on  the man at work is often extended to  the family at home.  double shift  Even if we work, we are still expected  to carry out the tasks of housework.  This means that working women face a  double workday: we work an eight hour  shift at work and an eight hour (at  least!) shift at home.  No wonder we  are exhausted.  If we have children, .  we are forced to choose between our  kids and our jobs, (if they are sick,  if daycare facilities are unavailable,  etc.). This reinforces our secondary  positions as workers, forces us into  part-time work and night shifts, and  reinforces our status as dependents.  The family and the housewife is essential as a unit of consumption.  The  family is structured so that we expect  to all have one car, a fridge, a television, a two-bedroom house of our  own, etc. This represents an incredible waste of resources. We are coerced by ads which promise us a better  life, but which rest on the exploitation of our bodies and minds.  boredom  Women in the home are set up for  boredom and unhappiness. The work  itself is repititious (no wonder  others will not do it), despite the  attempts by society to romanticize it.  What's more, it never  gets done. No  matter how many times the floor is  mopped, it will need to be done again,  no matter how many diapers are  changed, we will have to change another. This is in part why adverti  sing companies orientate to us. It is  not only that women are expected to  consume as part of our role as family  budgeter. We are also vulnerable to  consumption because there is little  else for us to do.  In North America, there have been some  changes in the structure of housework.  There are appliances, but their application is still only in individual  homes. There are limited daycare  resources, but they are being cut  back. Many of us work permanently,  and perhaps the people we live with do  some of the work in the home, but this  work still remains essentially our  task.  Unless women are freed from domestic  tasks, they will never be liberated.  This is because the most essential  sexist aspects of our roles (reproducing, housework, feminity, passivity) stem from both the nature and  job requirements of this work. We  can never be fully integrated into  work outside the home, if this work is  forever secondary to our main role.  We will only remain isolated and unhappy in the home.  THE WIZARD OF ID  By P»rk«f * Hart  VOLUNTEERISM  Volunteerism is "...one of the oldest,  most subtle, most complicated says in  which women have been disengaged from  the economy with their own eager  cooperation".  Women in Sexist Society,  Studies in Power and Power-  lessness.  Edited by Vivian  Gornick and Barbara K. Moran  What are the implications of volunteerism  for women, especially since the majority  of volunteers are women?  Initially it  may appear difficult to criticize anyone  or any group willing to work without pay,  but a more critical look at volunteerism  raises some contentious issues.  For  instance, does volunteerism deter the  government from assuming its social  responsibility? Can women afford to give  away their time and energy for nothing?  Is volunteer work a deterrent to improving  the status of women in society?  This last question is one of the key  criticisms of volunteerism.  Most of the  unpaid work in society is performed by  women, primarily in their role -as wives  and mothers.  Volunteerism is just one  more category of unpaid work.  Since in  Canadian society money is the status,  it follows that unpaid work is considered  to be of less value.  Given no economic  importance by society, the low status of  unpaid work reflects on those who do it,  i.e., mostly women.  Along with volunteerism comes a service  ideology (i.e. a willingness to help  others and put other interests ahead of  one's own) to which women are particularly  susceptible.  Rather than being paid  workers themselves they provide a free  labour force.  This can adversely affect  working women, who need their paid  employment.  Volunteerism can be  partially responsible for keeping wages  down for all women by, for example,  weakening employees bargaining power,  if in unions.  They do this by either  being willing to 'scab' in case of a  strike or by generally being available  to work which makes paid workers less  indispensable, particularly those women  not in unions, which constitutes the  majority of employed women workers.  There are benefits, other than  monetary, that can be gained from  volunteer work.  Examples include  practical experience, training  for job skills, building of  confidence, and satisfaction from  doing meaningful work.  It is  also painful to imagine the consequences should volunteer labour  be withdrawn, especially since  much of it helps women and children.  Even though this work should be  financed by the government, it is  doubtful that they would automatically assume this responsibility.  The National Organization for  Women's Task Force on Volunteerism  made a useful distinction between  two types of volunteer work.  Traditional, or service-oriented  volunteer work was seen as being  detrimental to improving the status  of women while political, or  change-oriented volunteer work was  seen as having the potential for  making changes that would benefit  women. -*■  '...volunteers are no threat to the  present system as long as they are  off in the sick bay folding bandages.  They're keeping the system going  just the way it is.  And, they're  not helping themselves in the area  of their greatest servitude - their  economci dependence upon men.'  Chatelaine June 1976  The traditional view of volunteers  as primarily 'housewives' was  supported, but somewhat modified,  by a national survey published in  1975 by the Canadian Council on  Social Development.  Just over half  of the female volunteers (52.9%)  were defined as housewives.  The  survey also showed that although  the majority of volunteers were  women, 44.5% were men.  In B. C, 52.7% of the population  is involved in some kind of volunteer  activity.   More than three-quarters  engage in active work while the  remainder donate money or "self"  (eg. blood, tissue)  turn to col. I, p. 15 15  women and work  VOLUNTEERISM from p. 14  A Grants Officer in the Community  Projects Division of the Ministry  of Human Resources (responsible for  allocating funds to social service  projects), said that in Vancouver  there is emphasis placed on programs  which have volunteer in-put and that  the majority of programs funded use  volunteers.  However, as far as  projects organized by, or for, women  are concerned, department policy  appears to be quite restrictive.  This is indicated by the fact that  women's centres are specifically  designated as one of the categories  not to be funded by the Ministry.  Specific women's organizations that  are funded by the provincial government are the Vancouver Women's Health  Collective, the Coalition of B. C.  Rape Relief Centres, and the Vancouver  Status of Women, though none know  from one year to the next if they will  be re-funded.  These groups provide  essential services to women and therefore should be funded by the government, and if forced to operate as  voluntary associations, would not be  able to offer such a compreshensive  service.  To volunteer or not to volunteer, then  is the question with which women are  faced.  It is importa/t to note that  some groups need to be free of government funding in order to operate  autonomously and without the pressure  to compromise their activities.  Volunteer status also provides a  license to criticize bureaucratic  methods and to make and/or demand  change.  One suggestion to consider  is to demand a guaranteed annual income  With this basic amount of money on  which to live, women could volunteer  in a greater number of areas without  the risk of exploitation.  *A guaranteed annual income is a way  of providing every adult Canadian  with a basic living income, thus  replacing all other forms of government provided income assistance.  This has been accepted in principle  by the Federal government but has  so far not been implemented.  1. Volunteerism, Ms., February 1975,  p. 73.  2.

The "International Women's Coordinating Commission to Prepare March 8,  1978" met in Paris on December 10 to  draw up plans for the action.  The Commission was mandated by the  international women's conference in  Paris last May, which was attended by  over 5,000 women.  One hundred women took part in the  planning meeting.  They came from England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland,  Spain, France, Austria, Algeria, Latin  America, and Africa. They represented  a wide range of organizations, currents , and political tendencies within  the women's movement.  The women took some important steps  towards coordinated March 8 actions  throughout Europe.  It was decided to  produce a poster in different languages, to issue a common press release  to the European media, and to coordinate actions on the same day — March  4.  Finally, the meeting agreed on the  need to coordinate internationally  two specific campaigns. Against repression — focusing on women prisoners in particular — and for freedom  of abortion.  WOMEN'S  WORK  The woman at home, usually the career  man's own wife, is expected to renew  his labour powers daily (cook, clean,  raise children).  He can, because of  this woman's labour, sell his labour  power without maintaining it, while  most women who go into the labour market are disadvantaged because they  have no wives.  His work is usually  made possible by her work - men profit both by higher wages and the  division of labour.  Working women  do, in fact, two-thirds of society's  work - no one renews the labour power  daily of working mothers...  There is a basic misconception in  patriarchal society:  invariably  women are expected to serve men.  And  no matter what work we do, it is  devalued, not because it is not  needed but because it is done by  women.  (Careers for Women, 1977 by Petra  Karin Kelly.  From the European  Economic Community, Economic and  Social Commission, Brussels, Belgium.)  (WIN NEWS)  FRANCE  In 1976, women in France made up only  22% of all apprenticeship trades.

The government announced  that it is sending a Bill to the Cortes  (parliament) seeking the removal of  adultery and cohabitation from the  criminal code.    In future,  judges  will be empowered to impose civil  sanctions.     Government sources say  the influence of the Roman Catholic  church against adultery is consider-d  to be deterrent enough.     If the Bill  is passed,  as it almost certainly  will,  a dozen Spanish - mostly  women - now in jail or awaiting  trial in adultery cases are expected  to be freed.

For the  first 10 years of her career, she  was not particularly concerned with  women's issues.  Having to prove herself an equal to men, she rather  avoided such issues, as she was  told from the start quite bluntly  "Journalism is no job for a women."  Matsui comments: "I see it this way:  the American and European women 's  liberation movement is based on....  European-type democracy and individualism.     ... this is very strong...  I went to China for one year.  There women's liberation goes hand  in hand with the revolution, with  changing the whole structure of  society.     When you look at Southeast Asia,  there the tradition of  the mother-centered society from  before modernization is still  strong (that was so in ancient  Japan too before Confucianism) so in  that sense Southeast Asian women are  very strong compared to Japanese  women.     ...We have to learn from all  three.   ...  Our economic system today is  ,  on a man working for all he's worth  and a woman backing him up.    If  women became equally independent  as men,   the Japanese economy would  not last.    Therefore we have all  kinds of propaganda to promote  the notion that a woman 's real  place is in the home.     One would  think that with a good economy  women would be better off, become  more aware, but it's the opposite.  Unless our present high-growth  policy in Japan changes,   things  won't imporve.     It's not a question  simply of educating women.   ..."  (WIN News)  FRANCE  In the French general elections this  month, the feminist movement will  be running candidates for the first  time.  NEW   ZEALAND  After April 1st, 1978, it will be  impossible to get a legal abortion in  New Zealand.  The only abortions will  be in cases of incest, or if the  mother-to-be is "severly subnormal".  The Contraception, Sterilization and  Abortion Bill was hailed by its  conservative supporters as "a tremendous  triumph for decent standards within our  community. "  The Bill will:  *WIPE OUT THE PROVISIONS IN THE PREVIOUS  N.Z. ABORTION BILL WHICH ALLOWED  "SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC" FACTORS TO BE  TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  *DISALLOW RAPE AS A REASON FOR OBTAINING  AN ABORTION, ^_\  The abortion debate was sprung on the  House by surprise when the right-wing  Nationalist Party Prime Minister  Muldoon moved the bill to the top  of the order paper.  The legislation  was forced through in a night session  during the New Zealand summer, at a  time when many parliamentarians were  absent overseas.  The only avenues for women wanting  abortions in New Zealand are the back-  alley abortionists and, for those  lucky enough to have the money, a trip  to Australia.  SORRY  MADAM  ^JjUJL©T8UWS  ITALY-RAPE LAW  The proposed deletion from the penal  code of the concept of crimes of honour  and the idea that marriage expiates  rape will have far-reaching effects.  The two articles which the new Bill  seeks to wipe out have been thoroughly  discredited.  The first lays down  short sentences in cases in which men  faced with unfaithfulness commit  murder ostensibly to protect their  honour, or that of the family.  Adultery is no longer a crime in  Italy, yet this article remained  practically a right to kill for  irate husbands, fathers or brothers  on the grounds of 'honour'.  Under the former bill, a man who  raped a woman went unpunished if he  agreed to marry her.  The marriage  also annulled the guilt of friends  who might have helped him rape her.  The practical effect of these  provisions was., "if you rape me  you can marry me; if I am unfaithful  to you, you can kill me."  (Avanti, WIN)  IRELAND  "Irish women,  trying to speed their  campaign for equal rights,  have been  set back by the economy.    There 's a  9.5 percent unemployment rate in the  Irish Republic,  highest in the  European Common Market,  and it's  sparked a backlash campaign to  send working married women back to  hearth and home.  One Catholic priest said in a radio  phone-in program on the state-run  RTE network.     "The working wife is  the greatest curse of this country. '  Ireland's 1.5 million women face a  formidable battery of laws that  appear Draconian compared with  the increasingly liberal feminist  legislation in Europe. "  *Sale of contraceptives is banned  under the Republic's 40 year old  constitution although the high  court ruled four years ago, in a  landmark decision, that they nay  be imported by individuals for their  own use.  * Abortion is illegal under the  constitution and bitterly opposed by  the church. But thousands of Irish  women go to England every year to  terminate unwanted pregnancies.  *Divorce is prohibited by the  constituion and only a national  referendum can change that. The  church has stonewalled moves to  legalize divorce but has in recent  years granted hundreds of annulments  as the divorce rate soared. Couples  can get civil divorces outside  Ireland, but under the Republic's  civil law they are still legally-  married and can be charged with  bigamy if they remarry.  *A husband can bring criminal charges  against his wife's lover for  "deprivation of services" because in  the eyes of the law she is the husband' s property. But the wife of an  unfaithful husband cannot bring  charges against his lover.  *Husband charged with wife-beating  can get legal aid, but wives filing  the charges have to pay for legal  representation.  * A woman has to work a year before  she is eligible for unemployment insurance.

HEARTS.'.,  BCFW BRIEF TO INQUIRY  A Royal Commission on the Incarceration of Female Offenders is  currently taking place in Vancouver.  The Commission has a provincial  scope, and was launched in response  to allegations of mismanagement at  the women's unit of Oakalla.  Justice  Patricia Proudfoot heads the  Commission, which has received briefs  from numerous groups concerned about  Oakalla women's unit.  The British Columbia Federation of  Women made its presentation February  23.  Spokesperson for the Federation  Lorri Rudland, said: "We were there  not only to present our recommendations with respect to the incarceration of female offenders in B.   C.  We were there to go on record as  publicly endorsing the recommendations that the women prisoners in  B. C.   had made to the Commission. "  "Women prisoners",   she added, "must  be recognized as the   'experts ' on  the subject of the incarceration of  females. "  ABOLITIONIST STANCE  The BCFW brief took an abolitionist  stance. "Prisons protect us for  the most part from people who wouldn 't  harm us.     They provide,  at best,  a  limited deterrent function and they  re-habilitate no-one",   said Rudland,  who presented the brief on behalf of  the BCFW. "On the contrary",   she  added, "the Report of the Parliamentary Sub-committee on the Penitentiary  System states:   'The prison system  subjects human beings to... the most  individually destructive,  psychologically crippling,  and socially  alienating experience that could  conceivably exist within the borders  of the country. '"  SYSTEM A PROVEN FAILURE  The brief began by challenging the  parameters of the Commission's investigation.  The Commission is mandated  to investigate whether or not  correctional policies and practices  are in accordance with the proper  administration of justice.  BCFW  asked the Commission to look beyond  its terms of reference of reform  measures which imply acceptance "of  a system that is a proven failure.  It asked the' Commission "to consider  a moratorium on prison construction  in B.C., and to make a serious  investigation of alternatives to  incarceration and alternative methods  of incarceration".  SEXIST, PATERNALISTIC  "Is the prison system responding to  the changing role of women in today's  society?", was a central question  posed by the BCFW brief. "Far from  discovering that prisons encourage  self-determination or self-definition  for men or for women",   said Rutland  in presenting the brief, "we find,  in fact,  the reverse is true,  and  that,  in addition,  women prisoners  are subjected to sexist and paternalistic attitudes that further work  against these concepts. "  The brief attacked the paucity of  job-training within the institutions  and pointed out that the inadequate  training which is provided "falls  within the lowest-paid and traditionally female occupational  groupings:  hairdressing, power-  sewing, laundry and kitchen work."  Paternalism in word and deed is  rampant within women's correctional  facilities.  The brief cited one  example:  "When a custodian of the  women's unit (at Oakalla) was asked  why women prisoners were not provided  with the Rules and Regulations  governing the treatment of prisoners,  the reply was: 'That is unnecessary.  We tell our girls everything they  need to know.  It would just cause  trouble.'"  REINFORCES DEPENDENCY  As the brief pointed out, this "kind  of protection from independent  decision making can only create and  reinforce dependency patterns and  increase frustration."'  BCFW recommended that Oakalla women's  unit be replaced with small,  community based facilities where work,  educational programs and social activities are integrated into the life  of that community.  ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION  The brief emphasized that economic  discrimination is practised against  women prisoners, because they form  only 10% of the prison population.  This is used as an excuse for the  inadequate provision of facilities,  and for jumbling together all  different kinds of inmates,  "including those serving varying  lenghts of sentences, the mentally  ill, ...the violent and disruptive,  the totally institutionalized, and  those from different cultures  or those who do not speak the  language."  BCFW stressed the need for meaningful, productive job-training, and  for adequate educational and  recreational facilities within the  institution.  It also called for  the abolition of solitary confinement.  In addition, it demanded  that the provincial minimum wage be  paid to all prisoners, that mail  censorship cease, that prisoners  have access to copies of prison  rules and regulations, and to their  own files.  It made specific recommendations concerning drug study  programs, the temporary absence  program and visiting regulations.  It proposed that a physician of the  prisoner's choice be made available  on a regular basis and that both a  prisoners' committee and a citizen's  advisory committee be set up.  REMOVE MALE GUARDS FROM LIVING AREAS  BCFW supports the removal of male  guards from the female prisoners'  living area, and recommended that  prisoners have input into the assessment process before staff members  are taken on in a permanent capacity.  %M, Fei^Mf 1!  IHMAJSS 8RICF  LIFE IN OAKALLA  A brief to the Royal Commission on the  Incarceration of Female Offenders in  B.C. was presented on behalf of all  the women inmates in Oakalla by inmate  Jan Taylor.  This brief gives us real insight into  what living conditions are like for  women in Oakalla. We realise that the  persons best qualified to comment upon  prisons are the prisoners themselves,  and that the Commission would need to  consider their recommendations with  utmost seriousness if they hoped to  effect any positive change.  Here are some highlights of that  brief:  The following recommendations represent the feelings of the women as a  whole, incarcerated at the Lower Mainland Regional Correctional Centre.  ABOLISH PRISON SYSTEM  We would like to ^recommend that the  prison system be abolished. A prison  takes away every prisoner's basic  needs and human rights. The very  nature of prisons breeds contempt and  brutality. Prisons fail miserably at  their professed objectives, rehabilitation, deterence and protection.  They produce jail house junkies and  criminals who will only come back into  the community somewhat more knowledgeable than they entered the system on  how to break the law.  It has been  proven unsuccessful due to the recidivist rate. We realize this is a  long range goal and ideal and no easy  task, but feel it is realizable. We  are therefore making the following  recommendations to deal with the prison at this time.  INTERVIEWS  RECOMMENDATION:  Women should be interviewed on ar-  rival to help them adjust and to  answer any questions with regard to  the institution policy, legal assistance etc.  When arriving at L.M.R.C.C, one finds  oneself completely disorientated. You  are stripped of all your pride and  dignity; you're no longer free to express your feelings and emotions. If  one happens to be lucky enough to have  an aggressive or extroverted personality, you may find your bearings.  If  you stay around long .enough, that is.  Many are frightened, insecure and unsure of themselves. They should be  advised who to contact with regard to  any problems they may run up against.  A position such as this could be handled by a reliable, knowleadgeable  prisoner and staff.  It would create a  more relaxed atmosphere for the woman.  Many who would be reluctant to speak  with staff themselves could benefit  having someone as a liason in between.  There is no one available to deal with  people from other ethnic groups when  they arrive at the prison.  It is very  difficult for one coming into a new  country, never mind a prison as well.  RULES AND REGULATIONS  RECOMMENDATION:  That a handbook of prison rules and  regulations be given to a woman on  arrival.  No prison rules and regulations are  now available to the woman.  BASIC PERSONAL NECESSITIES  RECOMMENDATION:  Basic necessities for personal  grooming and cleanliness should  be issued regularly by the institution.  At present most women upon arrival  must depend on those who have been  incarcerated for some time to loan  them deodorant, toothpaste, shampoo  and various grooming aids.  If you  happened to be a stranger you're just  plain out of luck as a rule because  most women are reluctant to ask for  assistance. All women have to purchase these items themselves from an  insufficient income of $ .50 per day  and up received working the institution.  Non-traditional job training skills  must be provided, e.g. air brake  training, woodworking etc. Women  prisoners helped build the Oakalla  Women's Woodworking shop and the Twin  Maples Minimum Security Prison. Hair-  dressing, sewing skills and such are  traditionally feminine and low paying  job skills. We do not want to be restricted to these.  WORK CAMPS  RECOMMENDATION:  That work camps for women be provided  and we suggest that existing work  camps could be on a co-ed basis.  There are work camps open to men in  B.C. We have heard that there is a  JOB TRAINING NEEDED  RECOMMENDATION:  Meaningful job training must be provided to facilitate women's re entry  to the work force, to all women who  desire it.  There is no work area in the institution that offers one anything other  than personal gratification. You may  learn hairdressing skills but that  doesn't give you a certificate to say  you're a qualified hairdresser. Our  beauty parlour is only equipped to  handle four operators and is usually  running at full capacity with insufficient materials to function properly.  There are many different power machines. Again we stress that although  you have been trained by a qualified  operator there is nothing to certify  that you are now an experienced operator yourself. The sewing area is  equipped to train approximately 15  women. At present it employs six only  and has for some time. A lack of  materials to work with is partially  responsible for this negligence.  possibility of Brannon Lake facilities  being opened on a co-ed basis. Men  already have camps all over the province and are possibly going to be  included in that facility as well. We  believe that many women serving sentence could benefit from these same  facilities. Women are just as capable  of planting trees, cleaning beaches,  handling machinery and tools, and  should not be discriminated against  with regard to work camps.  SCHOOL EQUIPMENT  RECOMMENDATION:  That an up-to-date school with up-to-  date educational criteria be instituted in an area away from living  quarters.  School is held in one of the group  living quarters during the day shift.  Schooling is programmed only for women  below a grade 12 level. There is  nothing geared to accomodate college  and university level women. There are  no typewriters, business machines or  anything along these lines which would  enable someone to find employment upon  release.  TURN TO P.22 L£TT€RS  Women from the Pink  Collar Brigade in  March 8 parade.  They came dressed in  costumes of unpaid  women 's work.  CLC   S SORWUC  Dear Sister:  I read with great interest the art-  cle by Joan Woodward, "SORWUC faces  off with the CLC" in the February  1978 edition.  Our union, CALFAA, has an 80% female  embership, runs its own affairs and  is affiliated to the Canada Labour  Congress.  We also donate to SORWUC.  Why as CLC affiliates did we donate  to SORWUC?  Because the status of  working women in the economy has  actually deterioriated since the  report of the Royal Commission on  the Status of Women.  We belive that  women in the Canadian workforce are  in desperate need of a strong  democratic trade union structure in  which to represent themselves and  resolve their concerns.  At present, still only 20% of women  in the workforce are unionized.  The  problems of women in the workforce  are well documented and their  problems need to be resolved.  All of the above, leads to the  following questions:  Who can  guarantee their resolution, the CLC  or SORWUC?  CALFAA as an 80% female union cannot  help but empathize and sympathize  with SORWUC.  However, the realities  of 1978 are that the CLC can strongly  provide representation whereas SORWUC  is a "maybe" solution at best, in  spite of SORWUCs strong, dedicated  feminist leadership.  So much money  is required to even get started on  the mammoth task of organizing all  of the branches of the banks  stretching from sea to sea, let  alone the problems of reaching a  decent first agreement.  SORWUC is  naive to believe that the job can be  done without massive and major  funding which can only come from the  CLC.  The job must be done properly and in  a united fashion.  For the sake of  all those yet unorganized women, we  cannot afford, within the labour  movement or the women's movement,  to get into jurisdictional hassles.  How does it aid SORWUC to call names  at the CLC whilst simultaneously  asking the CLC for assistance? Just  what is important for all those many,  many women functioning on bare sub-  sistance incomes and dreadful working conditions? Do they need  rhetoric or results?  I suggest to  you that they need results.  Women  have been waiting for far too long.  SORWUC and the CLC have more in  common than either realizes.  SORWUC,  those feminist, fighting furies have  accomplished something the CLC should  have done a long time ago.  SORWUC,  to some extent, represents feminists  who are finally discovering that the  realization of equal pay for work of  equal value is within trade union  framework.  Organizing working women  is indeed, the only way to make  stereotyped "women's" work, recognized  as work of value.  The CLC, that 80% male, old behemoth  has finally turned its shaggy head  in the same direction.  Sisters, we  all learn slowly, we all evolve.  Men too, even the CLC.  SORWUC needs  the CLC.  The CLC needs SORWUC.  We within the CLC need more feminists,  and feminists need to learn more  about trade unions.  It is time to  stop the rhetoric and get the job  done.  Our goals are so similar.  This is probably why we even share  bad press.  Yours fraternally and in sisterhood  Shirley L. Poole, National President  Canadian Air Line Flight Attendants  Association  Lyn Buckle photo  REPLY TO CALFAA  Dear Madame;  In reply to Shirley Poole's letter of  February 17th, I feel a clarification  of SORWUC's objectives is in order.  SORWUC's first priority is to encourage the democratic organization of  unorganized workers.  In regard to the  banks, our present goal is the organization of the bank workers of B.C.  and Saskatchewan.  Historically, each industry has been  organized by workers within that industry.  While money and support from  other unions are necessary for the  campaign to organize the banks, the  decisive requirement is that there be  an organization of bank workers capable of conducting the campaign.  SORWUC is the only union with an  organization of bank workers, an  autonomous section within SORWUC.  Two bank workers have recently been  elected by the United Bank Workers as  full time organizers.  This is only  reasonable since these women have a  first-hand knowledge of working conditions within the banks.  It is the  bank workers themselves, who will show  the greatest expertise in the organization and representation of bank  workers.  I would like to stress that SORWUC has  corresponded with the C.L.C. executive  for more than half a year in the hope  that some arrangement might be made to  enable SORWUC to become an affiliate  of the C.L.C.  The C.L.C. did suggest  that the bank workers divorce themselves from SORWUC's constitution and  structure in order to satisfy requirements for affiliation. However, this  proposal was overwhelmingly rejected  by the bank workers at their Special  Convention on January 29 of this year.  Both bank workers and other SORWUC  members feel that since our overtures  have met with the complete rejection  of our union and the principles behind  it, we must carry on with the organization of women workers, and in particular the bank employees of B.C. and  Saskatchewan, as best we can.  The most recent attempt of the C.L.C.  to organize women workers took place  in 1973 under the auspices of the  Association of Clerical and Technical  Employees union.  Over a million dollars was spent and almost nothing was  accomplished. We hope, and we have  reason to believe that we can do  better.  With specific reference to the banks,  we are not far off from having the  necessary financial means, and we most  certainly have the necessary woman-  power to achieve our goals. And on  behalf of SORWUC I would like to thank  those readers who have already contributed both their money and their time  to furthering our organizing drive.

I suggest that the present staff of  VSW should get to know their sister  organization better, perhaps then  they would stop making snide remarks  about the YW in their literature.  The YWCA has been kind enough to lend  the VSW their board room for general  meetings for a number of years.  Yet  at Christmas time it was pointed out  a party somewhere other than the YW  "bored" room would be much more fun.  We of the YW who built that room are  very proud of it.  However, I was  going to let that crack pass, until  I read another in the January Kinesis,  In the film review of "Intimate  Strangers", the reviewer says "the  /ictim did turn to a 'transition  house' (strangely, one run by the  YWCA)" What is so strange about it?  There are hundreds of YWCA's in 80  countries of the world doing whatever they can to help women and  girls.  Each YWCA is autonomous,  that is their programs differ from  place to place depending on need.  If in New York or wherever the story  took place a need for a transition  house became apparent to the YWCA  they would make every effort to  establish one (limited finances dog  every women's organization as you  well know!).  The Vancouver YWCA has been running  co-operative homes for single parents  and their children for years.  We  were into this long before the VSW  came into being!  As editor, I think it was your duty  to strike out that "strangely", even  if you had to make some enquiries  first.  The YWCA is an organization that  really knows the meaning of 'sisterhood1 and has been practising it  for over a hundred years.  Not in a  noisy fashion, but quietly and  sincerely.  Just ask the women who  have been released from prison in  South Africa through the efforts of  the YW; or the flood victims of  Bangladesh who have been cared for  by YW workers.  Perhaps you think I've made an issue  about two very small remarks, but  the women's movement will only gain  strength through unity; person to  person and organization to organization.  Sincerely  Pat Russell  SUBSCRIPTIONS  BEWLEY  Dear Kinesis  From a women's croup numbering eight  "active" members, approached the  Fraser Valley Regional Library  concerning gift subscriptions to  three feminist publications.  We are pleased to report that Mission  Public Library will be receiving  Kinesis, Branching Out and Makara,  courtesy of Fronya.  Moreover, the  regional library is considering  taking Makara on a permanent  basis for the entire system.  We suggest that other women's  groups consider gifts to their local  library.  All libraries have  acquisition policies, so any gifts  must be previewed, but we encountered  no difficulty.  Libraries are also  notoriously poorly funded, so  public demand determines acquisition  priorities.  If we help, with gifts,  to develop demand, the libraries  will take on permanent subscriptions.  Ellen Dixon  for Fronya  OUR READERS WRITE  Thank god the dollar signs in their  eyes prevent them from being totally  efficient vultures and blind them to  their inevitable defeat, while we  build our strength right under their  noses.  The future is ours!  I have been planning to send you my  renewal for ages...along with a letter  of support for your excellent efforts .  In the true spirit of sisterhood and  because I cannot be as available as I  once was, please accept my tithe as  proof that my politics are still somewhat together.  ($64.00 enclosed.  Thank you, sister!)  I thoroughly enjoy each issue and feel  you are playing a vital role in the  women's movement in B.C.  I particu  larly appreciate the political direction of most of the contributors you  publish.  KINESIS is an important link for me,  although I don't always agree with  your opinions.  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN/ THOUGH SILENT/  SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS.  Dear Sisters:  We read in the Montreal Star that  Judge Bewley was not removed from  his seat by the Judicial Council.  We have written to the Montreal  Star to protest that fact.  Even though this particular case  was not won, it is time that all  women's organizations attempt to  make public the facts about these  sexist men who are in positions of  power over women (and men too, for  that fact).  We are publicizing  this case in our next newsletter  which goes out to over 2000  women and men in Montreal and  Quebec, because we think women  ought to become aware of the fact  that Judges like this do exist,  and not only in BC.  I think that  the more cases like this that are  brought to light the better for  all of us.  Sooner or later one  of them is going to be removed, and  then and only then will all of them  begin to watch what they say, and  perhaps - although this is maybe too  much to hope for - a few of them will  begin to question their attitudes.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  We  enjoy getting Kinesis - there aren't  many sources of information about  what's going on in other parts of  the country.  Actually, we are  thinking of trying to start a  feminist paper which would carry news  and political analysis (etc) from  all over the country.  If anyone  there would be interested in  contributing to it on a regular  (or even irregular) basis, please  let us know.

In the part around the struggle  whether or not men and women should  be able to earn the same work-  points it is reported that the  women who raised the objection was  criticized for being selfish and  not working for the development  of the commune.  It was my understanding from the talk, that in  the end, it was seen that she  was right, that not being able to  make as many work-points as men  was, in fact, unfair and the  situation in that commune had been  rectified.  She was no longer  seen as selfish but as someone  who had struggled for what was  fair.  Sincerely  Betty-Ann Buss 22  more about Oakalla  CONT.  from p.   19  MINIMUM WAGE  RECOMMENDATION:  A minimum wage of $3.25 per hour be  paid to all prisoners whether in  school or other programs.  The women are not a bunch of illiterate, lazy nobodies with no motivation.  What is there to motivate them? There  is no award for good behavior, work or  such, yet there are definitely punishments for infractions of rules and  misbehaviour.  INCONSISTENCY RAMPANT  RECOMMENDATION:  Consistency is required for both staff  and prisoners with regard to rules and  regulations which must be provided to  women upon admittance.  Inconsistency runs rampant. Rules and  regulations vary with shift changes  and within shifts.  Continuity is required for both staff and prisoners  with regard to this. Those incarcerated in 1974-75 and previously saw  more programs and constructive ideas  conducive to re-entry into society  and rehabilitation.  Since that period  the women's building has been in a  stagnated regression.  LIBRARY  RECOMMENDATION:  That a quiet, separate prison library  containing up-to-date Criminal Codes,  other law books, prison rules and  regulations, prison and reformatories  acts, parole acts and the attorney  general's directives relevant to our  incarceration.  Most books in the library are cast-  offs from the Haney Correctional Institute. There are no Criminal Codes  or law books. We have books such as  Life In Outer Space, Harlequin Romances and How To Carve Your Own Work  Bench. A various collection of antiquated educational criteria, such as  Dick, Jane and Spot.  Other women in  the prison do not have access to the  library as it is kept locked after  school hours. Those not attending  school are not allowed into another  group area. More up-to-date modern  literature is required to make for  interesting reading.  RECREATION  RECOMMENDATION:  (a) That more programs be implemented  and recreational facilities be  provided.  Music lessons and the use of instruments should be provided for women  expressing interest. Music Is something that most everyone at the prison  is interested in and gives a great  deal of pleasure. We have an ancient  piano in the gym that is in poor condition as 10 keys are missing and have  been for a long time.  The lack of programs and recreational  facilities leads to more bitterness.  ABOLISH SOLITARY  Recommendation:  Abolition of Solitary Confinement.  Solitary confinement is an inhuman  and barbaric method of punishment.  It is used indiscriminately. To  attempt suicide or self inflict  wounds is punished by solitary confinement. A cry for help such as  slashing is an offence punished  by solitary confinement.  I quote from the institution's  solitary confinement log. This inmate was sentenced to 10 days for  slashing her wrists and barricading  her room. "Dec. 14th - 1:24 a.m. -  Hear strange noise coming from cell  #2. Upon checking found that said  inmate had weaved remainder of sheet  through bars and door in cell with a  narrow piece of sheet hanging down.  Caught her in the act of making a  noose. Removed sheet, tried calling  for assistance via phone - busy,  busy, busy. Pressed intercom a  number of times - no response."  At least there was a staff member  present when this incident happened.  Until recently the staff made hourly or 2 hourly checks but there was  no one present at all times. Why  was the phone continuously busy at  nearly 1:30 in the morning? This  was an emergency situation and the  phone was busy and none of the  night staff could be bothered to  answer the intercom. A week later  this woman was medically cleared to  be transferred to Twin Maples minimum security farm.  She later arrived back here with an escape  charge that could possible have been  avoided with competent staff who  would answer this cry for help in  the beginning. Another prisoner  also in solitary confinement for  slashing and barricading begging  constantly to see a psychiatrist  for days was completely ignored at  this time. Why must a woman go to  such self-destructive lengths to ask  for help?  COMPULSORY TREATMENT FOR  HEROIN ADDICTS DOOMED TO FAILURE  We would like to sum up by saying  that we condemn the government's  proposed compulsory treatment for  heroin addicts. We feel that maintenance heroin treatment should be  instituted for the addicts.  The  compulsory treatment is a waste of  taxpayers money, an abrogation of  basic human rights and is definitely doomed to failure.  It would  cost the self-supporting addict  pennies a day if legalized. Most  crimes by women in particular centre around drugs.  open letter  to Repo  Letters from Marjaleena Repo appeared  in Kinesis, December '77 and February  '78.  Dear Marjaleena Repo:  What does your group do besides  attack the women's movement? God  knows we don't hold the power the  way the government or the state  apparatus does. We don't control  people's lives.' We try in the best  way we know how to fight sexism. We  struggle to understand classism and  racism and yes, we try not to be  defensive. Yes, we fight with each  other and we don't always come up  with the right answer.  Having said that I would also like  to point out that we are not a highly organized group who hold private  meetings. We are many small groups  who come together at different times  to organize around an issue, or to  share experiences, or to analyse  what is happening now to women. We  are only a small section of the women's movement and I believe that  despite our differences we have a  healthy respect for each other.  Before the women's movement came  along I was in a fog. There was  nobody who spoke directly to my  needs.  I was a true blue working  class woman choking on my working  class pride.  I was too proud to  even accept unemployment insurance  or welfare.  The women's movement gave me the  courage to grow.  It also educated  me to the way the system manipulates  working class people.  It enabled me  to see the way I as a worker,  mother and woman had been trained  to take part in my own oppression.  It helped me to direct my energy  outwards, to fight back.  I spent some time with you and I  was impressed with your knowledge  of how things work, and with your  and Cady's ability and energy to  get things done. However, I think  I would find it very hard to work  around you because it's not safe to  think out loud with you. You repeat  word for word what I say yet I know  you don't know what I mean.  I feel  like I'm being interrogated instead  of being listened to, and anything  that I say will be used as evidence  against me.  I have only talked to two members of  your group and you made political  sense.  I also read your articles in  Transformation. They also made sense.  The only fault I find is that you  spent more time attacking the groups  that are fighting the system than  attacking the system. I am not say  ing that we should never criticize  each other. Of course we should.  But when we just give negative criticism then that is destructive, and  unfortunately that is the way you have  been coming across.  I would like to read more about what  you and the group are doing to fight  the system.  I would like to know  because even though our styles are  different I think our aim may be the  same.
