X  £  Vancouver Status of Women  1 /; ®78     \  MATTIG GUNTGPvMAN THANKS TO YOUR SOLIDARITY we're still here -almost  VSW  This year, Vancouver Status of Women  will be operating on less than half  of our necessary budget. Although  many of our services will have to be  cut, Kinesis will survive.  B.C.'s Provincial Secretary, Grace  McCarthy, allocated this group only  $75,000 for the coming fiscal year.  Describing her grant as "generous",  she offered the following excuses for  partial funding:  "Your request for full funding is not  justifiable as a number of your activities are in part duplication of  government services." She does not  provide specific examples.  Our Constituency  Is A Poverty Group  McCarthy accuses us of failing to  find "community support in depth" -  viz private funding. She simply refuses to acknowledge that our constituency is a poverty group - women.  At an emergency meeting March 16, the  Vancouver Status of Women voted unanimously to protest McCarthy's decision. A telegram was immediately sent  to McCarthy, requesting funding in  full.  On March 20, an information picket  went up outside McCarthy's constituency office on Fraser Ave. Information sheets about the services provided  by VSW, and McCarthy's budget, went  to every home in her riding.  McCarthy's offices in Vancouver and  Victoria were deluged with calls,  demanding the other half of the budget for VSW. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU  WHO CALLED.  When the Provincial Legislature reopened March 30,  2,500 protested  on its steps, demanding jobs.  L.to R. Rosemary Joy, Margaret Mitchell  (NDP Candidate,  Vancouver  East), Margaret Birrell.  Gayla Reid (L) and Susan Moore  (R) of VSW, before setting  out to picket Grace McCarthy's constituency office.  Here's how Grace McCarthy spends  her share of government money:  $100,000 for 5 cars on the Royal  Hudson (train promoting tourism)  $400,000 on advertising  $225,000 on the Royal Hudson Silver  Jubilee Tour  $105,000 repairs to the Royal Hudson  $80,000 on Hospitality Certificates  $60,000 Tourist Counsellors for the  B.C.Ferry Fleet  $1.6 million to promote Captain Cook  On the one million women of B.C., she  spends $75,000.  BC Women  Have Nothing  To Smile About  At Vancouver Status of Women, with our  staff already depleted by one, we are  re-establishing our priorities to decide where our energies can most usefully be spent.  In addition to producing Kinesis each  month,  here 's what we do at VSW:  Legal Information Clinics  Assertiveness Training  Consciousness Raising  Complete Reference Library on Women 's Issues  Education Programmes in Schools and  Universities  Speaking Engagements to Community  Groups  "Woman Alive" - weekly television  show  Information by phone on Women 's  Issues  Community Development  Publications  Communication Skills Workshops  Space Available for Use by Other  Women's Groups  Briefs on Legislation  Submissions to Boards and Inquiries  Research.  Many of these services will now have  to be cut.- It is extremely painful to  have to make that decision.  For the coming year, VSW has listed  its priorities:  1. The physical space, 2029 West 4th  Ave, must be kept open for use by all  women's groups.  2. The newsletter, Kinesis, must continue, as an information link and a  forum for feminist issues.  3. Action-oriented community development around women's issues which will  reach women who cannot reach us.  Rope Relief  On March 31st, the funding for the  BC COALITION OF RAPE RELIEF CENTRES  ran out. They have received no word  about funding for the coming year,  no indication that interim funding  will be provided. Last year, the coalition (comprised of centres in Kamloops, Nanaimo, Victoria and Vancouver) received $125,000 combined from  the Attorney General, the Minister  of Health and the Ministry of Human  Resources.  WRITE TO ALL THREEE DEPT- 'ñ†  ARTMENTS AND DEMAND TO KNOW WHERE  THE RAPE RELIEF FUNDING IS.  Health  Collective  The VANCOUVER WOMEN'S HEALTH COLLECTIVE is still waiting on word from  the government about their funding.  Health Minister McClelland has been  receptive, and has given them verbal  indications that they will receive  at least as much as they did last  year - $90,000. They have, however,  received no formal indication. WRITE  TO MCCLELLAND, MINISTER OF HEALTH  AND URGE HIM TO GET THE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS FINALIZED. 2  Say Goodbye  to Storaska  The Storaska movie, "How to Say No  to a Rapist and Survive", was banned April 3 by the Vancouver School  Board.  The film has been banned in other  major Canadian cities such as Toronto and Ottawa. Locally, the Provincial Educational Media Centre  recently withdrew the film from  its library, while the National Library of Canada has also canned it.  Stephanie Crate, of the Vancouver  Rape Relief centre, commented: "We  are pleased that the Vancouver School Board has decided to act in a  responsible manner to remove this  film. Storaska gives misleading  advice about rape, which places  women, children and male victims  of rape in physical and legal danger ."  Rape Relief and Vancouver Status  of Women supplied the School Board  with background information about  its sexist and dangerous content.  New Rape Film  A new film about rape has just  been released, and it will provide  an excellent resource for talks and  workshops. "This film is about rape",  was made by Bonnie Kreps, for the  B.C.Rape Prevention Project, a joint  venture by both the B.C.Police Commission and Rape Relief. The movie  comes with a manual which contains  suggestions for post-film discussion.  Next month's Kinesis will carry a  review of the film and manual.  Press Gang has Moved  PRESS GANG PRINTERS AND PUBLISHERS  is moving. After many years in the  basement at 821 East Hastings, they  are moving up to Princess and Powell  - up to sunshine and more space.  Moving expenses will be more than  $3,000. As a group which does not  receive any form of government funding, they will have to meet those  expenses from donations.  PRESS GANG is central to the women's  movement in Vancouver. Send them what  you can to welcome them to their  new address : 603 POWELL STREET, VANCOUVER, V6A 1H2.  Rape Conference  The National Conference of Canadian  Rape Crisis Centres will take place  in Victoria during the last weekend  of April.  Priorities of the conference will be  to finalize the constitution for a  national association of rape relief  centres and to discuss strategies  for legal reform concerning rape.  Delegates from each established rape  crisis centre across Canada are expected to attend. Approximately 85  people will be coming, from as far  away as New Brunswick. In addition,  there will be observers from Yukon  and the NWT, where incipient rape  crisis centres are being developed.  Joanie Vance, the National Assister  of Canadian Rape Crisis Centres, will  be there. So will Lorenne Clark and  Debra Lewis, who wrote Rape: The  Price of Coercive Sexuality. Alice  Ages of SWAG and Rosemary Brown NDP  will be keynote speakers.Lucy Berliner, from the Seattle Sexual Assault Centre, will discuss the sexual assault of children.  BCTF Conference  At the annual convention of the B.C.  Teachers' Federation in Vancouver  this Easter, feminist Julia Goulden  was defeated in her bid for the Federation presidency by conservative  encumbent, Pat Brady.  Goulden, however, received substantial support. Moreover, the BCTF did  pass progressive policy to combat  sexism and racism in B.C. schools.  Highlights of the resolutions against  sexism include:  - a call for the BCTF to defend the  rights of women, regardless of marital  status, to be employed on the same  basis as men.  Supporting statement to this resolution spoke to the restrictions on parenthood leave, increasing numbers of  women on temporary appointments, and  current statistics on female teacher  unemployment - all of which indicate  that a critical situation is developing.  - a call for affirmative action in  hiring.  - a proposal that each school board  examine the status of female students  and teachers, and develop a program  to eliminate sex discrimination.  - a proposal that Practical Life  Skills be developed, to encompass  various aspects of home economics  and industrial education in a fully  integrated manner.  - a recommendation that programmes  be developed to educate students  about rape and sexual assault.  Policy, by itself, cannot produce  change. But these resolutions give  us some ammunition when pressuring  our own school boards and districts.  BURKE VS. NORTH SHORE CREDIT UNION  The story of Judith Burke's dismissal as Public Relations Officer  from the North Shore Credit Union  because she wrote about sex-  stereotyping appeared in February  Kinesis. Judith appealed for  people to run in the upcoming  elections to the board of directors. Although greatly encouraged  by the support received so far  from feminists, she says that  even more help is required.  Concerned for the welfare of remaining staff members, Judith has  kept in touch with a number of  them. She believes that certain  employees are being harassed by  management to the point of having  to quit, or suffering health  problems. There seems to be an  atmosphere of fear amongst the  employees.  Commenting on the issue, people  have mentioned to Judith that,  despite her suggestion to members  to leave their money at the cre  dit union, some may feel strongly  enough about the situation to  withdraw all funds except the  five dollars required for membership (and therefore still retain  voting power). If members decide  to do this and they write a letter  to the president explaining their  purpose, Judith would appreciate  receiving a copy.  You are urged to attend the annual meeting. Voting by proxy is  not allowed, so a large turnout  of supporters is required. All  members over age 16 (minimum of  $5 in Share savings - bring your  passbook) are eligible to vote.  The meeting will be held:  Tues. April 25, 7 p.m.  Carson Graham School  (Auditorium)  2145 Jones Avenue  North Vancouver  For further information, please  call Judith Burke at 985-3852. SORWUC NEWS  Wizard of Id  \  And FfiHse benefits.           )  r YfeS, BUT WHAT ABOUT   j j  ^^"jj  !K$\  cP!k  /w Jo!  —^fer^Rf-  j^JSJtt  Muckomuck Certified  SORWUC Local 1 has been certified to  represent the employees of Muckamuck  Restaurant, which specializes in Indian food. All of the staff are native people, although the owners are  not.  "We joined SORWUC because we wanted  job security and better working conditions", said a union member and  employee of Kuckamuck. "We needed a  union contract because it is the  only way we are guaranteed a say in  our working conditions. We joined  SORWUC because it is a union that  lets us draw up our own contract to  reflect our own situation.  "One of the biggest problems Is scheduling. The way it is now, some of  us don't know from one day to the next  what our hours will be. In fact, we  are told that we could lose our jobs  if we don't have a phone - that's how  bad scheduling is here.  "We hear a lot about how we are one  big happy family, but then we also get  told that if we're not happy, we can  be replaced.  " Since the Union was certified, we  have started getting our regular breaks  - but it used to be that we could work  a seven and a half hour shift, without  a break, and it is a busy restaurant.  There are a lot of other little rules  too, like you can't sit on the stairs  and rest your feet for a minute,and  you aren't supposed to talk to the  staff in the back hall.'  4 Fired  "Job security is also a big issue.  Since the union drive started, four  people have been fired, and union members at Muckamuck consider this to be  intimidation by the employer. The Union has filed unfair labour practices  with the Labour Relations Board over  the firings.  "We need a voice in our scheduling  and working conditions - we have the  right to plan our personal lives around our job, and we need to know when  we are going to work so we can do that  - as well as budget our finances.  "Now that we are certified with SORWUC  we hope that our management will listen to us and respect our requests  for changes in our working conditions."  Average salary for a bank teller is  $8,800 a year. Average salary for  Canadians last year: $13,406.  _Dulyk Loses,  The Canada Labour Relations Board  has rejected a complaint by the  Service, Office and Retail Workers  Union of Canada (SORWUC) that the  Bank of Commerce committed an unfair labour practice in laying off  a union representative from it's  Gibson's Branch.  "This decision is one more indication that the laws are stacked in  favour of the banks," said Dodie  Zerr of the United Bank Workers  section of SORWUC.  Carol Dulyk is the representative  of the Gibsons Branch on the union  negotiating committee. Her lay-off  followed the lay-off of the original union organizer in the bank,  Eileen Quigley. The manager, by his  own admission before the Labour Relations Board, was upset and contin  ues to be upset by the fact that the  employees in the branch joined the  union. Yet the Board ruled that the  union did not prove anti-union motivation on the part of the employer.  "Carol Dulyk was a senior teller in  the branch. Her last evaluation report was good. This decision by the  Board shows that bank employees have  no rights until they have a union  contract. It also shows that bank  workers must rely on our own strength  and on the strength of our public support to prevent the banks from taking  anti-union action. We obviously cannot expect the Labour Relations Board  or the Courts to compel the banks  to accept unionization", said Zerr.  The Union cannot accept this decision.  The United Bank Workers will be holding meetings this week in Gibsons  to plan further action.  THIS   OUGHT   TO   HELP   H/M    RECONSIDER  Credit Union  Employees at the Electrical Trades  Credit Union in Burnaby have just  signed a second collective agreement,  in which they won wages of $980.00  a month for a 33 hour week.  The  certification for the credit union  is held by the Service, Office,  Retail Workers Union of Canada,  Local 1.  Charlotte Johnson, president of the  United Bank Workers section of  SORWUC, stated, "This is the type  of contract we intend to win for  all women in the clerical and  banking fields."  The contract also includes 5 days  of family illnesses leave, a  floating holiday, and four weeks of  holiday in the third calendar year.  CLRB Decision  The Canada Labour Relations Board  has ruled recently that unionized  bank workers will not be paid as  much as non-unionized workers.  SORWUC pressed charges against the  Bank of Nova Scotia and the Royal  Bank because both banks have been  witholding system-wide increases  from unionized banks. The CLRB decided that banks can pick and choose  about their increases, and withold  increases from organized banks.  One member of the three-member CLRB  panel dissented, saying that there  was no question about the matter :  clearly there has been discrimination  and the discrimination will have the  effect of undermining the union.  Officials of the Canadian Banks Association said March 15 that only a  handful of bank workers belong to  unions because they are happy with  working conditions, not because managers are pressuring them to stay  away from unions.  (CP)  In another recent ruling, the banks  disputed SORWUC contracts which had  included a manager's secretary and  a loans officer in their bargaining  units. The Banks lost, both before  the CLRB, and at their appeal to the  Federal Courts. WOMEN'S STUDIES SUMMER INSTITUTE  SFU  Womens Studies  The Women's Studies Programme at Simon  Fraser has organized a special Institute for this coming summer, a six week  session from July 3 to August 19, that  will feature outstanding feminists as  visiting faculty.  Dorothy Livesay,  well known poet and author, will co-  teach "Women in Canada:  1920-Present"  with Barbara Todd, one of the authors  of Never Done and She Named it Canada.  Two other credit courses will be  offered:  "Women and the Visual Arts"  and "Issues in Women's Health and  Health Care".  The first of these  will be taught by Maria Tippett, an  art historian and author of the  forthcoming Emily Carr: a Biography;  the second will be taught by Abby  Schwartz, one of the authors of  Our Bodies, Ourselves.  The institute serves several functions.  It gives the Women's Studies  programme a chance to bring in  people like Livesay, Schwarz and  the other faculty who would not be  able to teach in W.S. programme.  It makes Women's Studies courses  available to teachers and others  looking for summer session courses.  And, for participants, it is designed  as an intensive educational experience since a variety of other  happenings are planned.  The courses  themselves will provide very concentrated material; they are regular  university courses done in half the  time.  For this reason participants  are expected to take at most two of  the courses for credit.  All of the  courses are open to special auditors  at half the usual fees.  Special  audit does not require admission to  the university and, for such students,  provides a way of taking the course  on a credit free basis.  A number of credit free workshops  and special events will be part of  the Institute.  Foremost among these  will be two weekend symposia;  "Women and Power" on July 21-22 and  "Women as Artists" on July 28-29.  An  evening discussion series "Varieties  of Feminism", to be held at the SFU  Women's Centre, will feature local  feminists as resource people in an  interchange of ideas and strategies.  A major exhibit of the work of B.C.'s  Women artists and a film series are  among the other events planned.  Those wishing credit for any of the  courses must be admitted to the  university.  The deadline for applications for new admissions is May 15  (for anyone registered at another  university or college or for those  over 23 this is a particularly-easy  process).  Further information is  available from Meredith Kimball or  Margaret Benston, Women's Studies,  Simon Fraser University, Burnaby,B.C.   LABOUR COD€   MOR€ RIGHTS FOR TH€ UNORGANIZ€D?  liill C-8, An Act to Amend the Labour  Code received second reading in the  House of Commons on December 4, 1977.  This Bill provides the first major  revisions to the Canada Labour Code  in five years and includes more rights  for unorganized workers.  It affects workers in the federally  regulated private sector - workforce  numbering some 555,000 in industries  such as banking, airlines, broadcasting, railways, trucking, grain-  handling and communications operations.  The changes which will affect most  workers are:  - the extra statutory holiday  (Boxing Day)  - the right to three days leave with  pay for death in the family  - up to twelve weeks sick leave without pay after three months employment  - a prohibition to dismiss or lay off  an employee solely because she is  pregnant.  Before, you had to have been continuously employed for a period of  twelve months before the date of dismissal due to pregnancy.  PROTECTION OF UNORGANIZED FROM UNJUST  DISMISSAL  A major section (61.5) would afford  non-unionized employees protection  from unjust dismissal.  It would  provide a procedure which employees  who feel they have been dismissed unjustly could complain to an inspector  (designated under the Canada Labour  Code).  After investigation, and if there is  no settlement, the case could be  transferred to an adjucator who  would have the power to order rein  statement or compensation.  (This of  course presumes you have the time  and energy to follow through on the  complaint.)  Further amendments give an employee  the right to refuse to work if she  or he preceives a condition at work  that constitutes an imminent danger  to safety or health, and provides  for the establishment of safety and  health committees (either by fiat  or voluntarily).  CANADA LABOUR BOARD  Changes have been made, increasing  the powers of the Canada Labour  Board.  1. The Board would allowed to make  regulations respecting the  criteria for determining whether  an employee is a member of a  trade union.  2. The Board would be allowed to  order a representation vote whenever the Board considers that  it would assist the Board to  dispose of a question that has  arisen.  3. The Board would be given power  to settle the terms and conditions of the first collective  agreement between the parties  if negotiations have been  exhausted.  4. The employer would be prohibited  from changing the terms or  conditions of employment while  an application for certification  is pending and within 30 days  after the union has been certified as a bargaining unit.  Canada's bankers are worried that  these changes in the Canada Labour  Board's powers will give the unions  who are organizing banks too much  power....  poor babies  JUST CAN'T COP€  Mr. David MacDonald: in view of the  fact that women have been licensed  as pilots for the past 65 years in  Canada, can the minister explain why  it is still the policy of the  Department of National Defence not to  have any women pilots in National  Defence?  Mr. Danson: The difficulty really  revolves itself in relation to women  serving in combat, which is something  quite frankly, we have not come to  grips with:  no western nation really  has.  Our pilots are versatile and  must perform many roles.  It does  create a problem—one which we are  examining—in so far as women serving  in combat is concerned.  We have not  yet made a decision as to what is an  appropriate role, after the experience of other nations which have  tried that and found it quite  demoralizing, not because women cannot stand it but because men in  combat with them emotionally are not  able to accept it.  From Hansard,  March 13,   1978  '***  WANT€D  FOR GROSS SEXISM, BLATANT BIAS  In Vancouver, the sexist coverage  of the March 8 parade by Vancouver  Sun reporter Dave Stockand has drawn  protest from an anonymous group.  The group produced and distributed  a flyer which carried Stockand's  picture, and stated, "WANTED: Dave  Stockand, for gross sexism, blatant  bias and false information in his  journalistic reporting on March 9,  1978." The flyer concluded: DAVE  STOCKAND IS GUILTY AND MUST PAY FOR  HIS GROSS INJUSTICE!  The poster is now decorating telegraph  poles and storefronts in Vancouver.  Turn to p.22 for a letter which you  can write to the Sun to register your  comments on the media coverage of  March 8. 5  national action committee  confers, lobbies  %  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women held their annual  conference in Ottawa on the weekend  of March 17.  The National Action  Commitee (NAC) has 130 member groups  which represent several million women  from coast to coast.  VSW members Lee Grills, Jillian  Ridington and Karen Richardson  attended this conference.  Two of  them, Lee and Karen, were elected to  NAC as Members-at-Large, constituting  the only B.C. representation on the  executive.  Member Diana Ellis led  the lobby skills workshop.  Kinesis spoke with Lee Grills on her  return from Ottawa.  Kinesis:    A lot of feminists I know  are not familiar with NAC and what  it does.     What is this national group,  anyway?    When was it formed?  Grills: The National Action Committee  on the Status of Women grew out of the  Committee for the Equality of Women in  Canada. That's the group that mounted  the national lobby which led to the  establishment of the Royal Commission  on the Status of Women.  Kinesis:    I gather it's an umbrella  group for women's groups across Canada.  Is it a sort of B.C.F.W.   on a national  scale?  Grills: Something like that. The  groups which participate in NAC cover  a very wide spectrum: Rank and File,  Montreal; Toronto Rape Relief; the  Ontario Federation of Labour; Cape  Breton Working Committee on the  Status of Women; the Communist Party  of Canada - they're all member groups.  Then there're groups like the  following: Federation of Junior  Leagues of Canada, Zonta Club of  Toronto, Canadian Association of  Women's Deans and Advisors.  Kinesis:    What priorities could bring  such a mixed group together?  Grills: NAC works for legislative  reforms designed to improve the status  of women in Canada. The removal of  abortion from the Criminal Code, the  removal of rape from the sexual offences . section of the Criminal Code,  for example. Their most recent definition of priorities looks like  this:  1. Equal Pay for work of equal value  2. Equal opportunity for jobs,  training, education and mobility  3. Universal access to child-care  services  4. Birth control services to all who  need them/abortion, a matter of  private conscience  5. Family law reform/marriage, a  partnership of equals  6. Pension rights for the homemaker/  spouse  7. Support for native women's rights.  Kinesis:    Who plays a leadership  role in NAC,  in defining these  priorities,  for example?    Was  there any caucusing at the  conference?    How would you describe  the dominant ideology?  Grills: No caucusing that I  noticed. I would say that there's  a mix of ideologies on the executive, with commitment to reform  the common factor. There's  certainly a very visible difference  among the women at the conference  for instance it's noticeable in the  way we dressed. Ultra-suede to  blue jeans.  Kinesis:    What kind of power as a  lobbying group does NAC have?-   Does  the government listen to NAC?  Grills: Certainly, MP's take some  kind of interest in the NAC convention. Flora MacDonald was there,  so was Simma Holt. The P.C. critic  on women's issues (a male) also put  in an appearance.  One of the actions of the conference was to lobby MP's on women's  issues. We addressed all three  caucuses. The conference unamin-  iously passed a resolution calling  for the removal of abortion from  the criminal code, for immediate  steps to ensure equal access to  birth planning, for health clinic  funding....  Kinesis:    The' Anti-Abortionists  didn't show?  Grills: None in sight. When we  presented the abortion resolution  to the Liberal caucus, they said  they intended to leave the abortion  law just as it is now. The NDP  has policy that abortion should  be a matter of choice for the  woman and her doctor. The P.C.'s  said that if they got into power  they would put the matter to a  vote in the Commons   Kinesis:    One of the workshops  at the conference was devoted to  Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value.  Many feminists think this issue  is a red herring...we all wear ourselves out defining and redefining  "equal value" "or substantially  similar value", and the wage gap  quietly goes on widening.     Were  any of the NAC reps challenging  the adoption of equal pay for work  of equal value as a priority?  Grills: There was a resolution  passed which spoke to the issue of  widening wage gap.  It called upon  the federal government to effectively implement affirma t ive action  programs and to review the voluntary nature of these programs with  an eye to making them compulsory.  Generally, I think that the feeling  at the conference was in favour of  regarding equal pay for work of  equal value as a priority issue.  Kinesis:    Any other resolutions of  note?  Grills: There was one deploring the  deportation of Jamaican women workers  in Toronto, and another supporting  the striking Bank Note Workers in  Ottawa.  Kinesis:    What kind of representation  was there from B. C.,  apart from the  three  VSW women?  Grills: There were two women from  Ts'aiku Women's Centre in Burns Lake,  two from Terrace, and one from the  Status of Women Action Group in  Victoria. Darlene Marzari was there,  too, as a speaker.  Kinesis:    The delegates met for a  weekend,  passed resolutions and took  in lobbying.     What do you think was  achieved?  Grills: For me, the nain purpose of  NAC is its function as a communication  link between different women's groups  throughout Canada. The information  exchange is a really valulable thing.  Women from different classes and  different lifestyles actually sit  down and talk with one another: on  certain fundamental reforms, we do  agree.  Kinesis:    Does NAC have any liaison  with the Advisory Council on the  Status of Women,  or with the existing  Provincial Councils on the Status of  Grills: Unofficially, NAC's member  groups are all non-government organizations.  Kinesis: What's the best avenue for  women and women's groups to take if  they want to find out more about the  National Action Committee?  Grills: Status of Women News, NAC's  publication.  Kinesis: I see they're going in for  a new spiffy format....

Vancouver and Ottawa are a  long way apart.  Going to the Annual Convention of  the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women was a revelation and a challenge for me, and  the questions it raising I am still  mulling over.  roads to  changed  Is the way to change things for all  women to increase the numer of politically conscious women in positi-  ions of power? Or is it to form our  own counter-systems, providing alternatives to a male dominated and  hierarchical system? Are both necessary, and can they work together?  When and how can they be co-ordinated  or eventually synthesized?  As it becomes more and more obvious  that governments will not continue  to fund organizations that actively  seek political change, these questions become more important.  I was impressed by the number of competent, articulate, politically skilled and (seemingly) confident women I  met in Ottawa. Their 'pipelines' to  important offices, their knowledge of  how to ask the right questions to  reach the right ears, the efficiency  of their information-sharing network,  inspired awe.  But I was left, in the end, with a  nagging frustration.  Many of the issues that were raised,  and particularly those that were presented as questions to the caucuses,  were ones that have been discussed  since before the Royal Commission on  the Status of Women was first tabled.  Why, eight years after the abortion  caravan, must we still ask caucuses  if they support removal of Section  251 from the Criminal Code?  Why did we allow passage of a Human  Rights Act that specifically excluded the human rights of native  women?  Why is equal pay for equal value  still an issue, a decade after submissions on women and poverty were  made to the Royal Commission on the  Status of Women?  neFieoTions  on  nac  Why, if the road to equality is through the involvement of women in  the political system, are so few  women given nominations in good ridings, even by the one party which  does ostensibly support total equality for women?  During the conference I was confused and outraged when told that women  should cross political party lines  to vote for other women. Familiarity  with B.C. politics creates awareness  of the ludicrous nature of that proposal!  There was, however, some solidarity  across class lines and an honest attempt to make N.A.C. more truly representative of women in all regions.  what  have  we gaine<  d?  Issues of particular importance to  B.C. women were raised in the lobbying. Block funding, and the fear of  loss of social services in provinces  where provincial governments give them  low priority, was one of these. A verbal promise that monitoring systems  will be available, and information supplied to concerned groups, was given  by the Minister in charge of women's  issues.  Though I started the weekend overwhelmed by the apparent skills of the Eastern women, in retrospect, my respect  for the B.C. women's movement was increased by the comparison.  The only union organized totally by  and for working women had its beginnings here, and is growing in strength.  Our lobbying model, developed for the  Women Rally for Action, has become  recognized and imitated throughout  Canada. Diana Ellis skilfully directed a lobbying workshop which resulted  in presentations to the caucuses which  was said to be, "the best ever, by far.  We have a provincial coalition of rape  crisis centres in B.C., and the greatest number of transition houses in any  province.  We have perhaps the strongest and most  dedicated feminist politician in Canada serving us in the provincial legislature .  jillian  riddington  In a geographically diverse province  we do have a representative - and diverse - working federation of women's  groups: BCFW.  But we do lack political clout. Most  of our organizations are marginal,  dependent on the very institutions we  seek to change.  We do need women in politics, at all  levels. Women should vote for women  but only for women who will truly  represent them. Our candidates must  be women who understand the economic  and social realities of life for most  women. We do need liaison with politically skilled women throughout Canada.  To the extent that N.A.C.'s concerns  echo our own, affiliation with N.A.C.  can be of benefit. N.A.C. has attempted  regional representation, and VSW's president, Lee Grills, along with representatives from most other provinces, was  elected to the new executive. This will  certainly allow us much closer liaison  than we had in the past.  A warning, -though. N.A.C.'s purposes  include "to initiate and work for improvement in the status of women by  actions designed to change legislation,  attitudes and customs which discriminate  against women."  For those among us who believe that  more far-reaching and radical changes  are necessary, that alternative systems  and institutions must be developed,  action on many other fronts continues  to be necessary.  *IN ANY GIVEN SOCIETY THE  DEGREE OF WOMAN'S EMANCIPATION  IS THE NATURAL MEASURE OF THE  GENERAL EMANCIPATION."  - FOURIER REPRESENTATION    without     NOTIFICATION  The government o-f B.C. appears to be  trying to keep the women of B.C. out  of the national discussion on the  status of women.  So far, they've  been quite effective.  Take the Status of Women Advisory  Council meetings, for example.  Last  November, a joint meeting of the  provincial councils and the federal  council took place in Halifax, Nova  Scotia.  Six provinces currently have Status  of Women Councils.  Nova Scotia's  Status of Women Council was appointed  in the autumn of 1977, just in time  to host the November conference.  New Brunswick's was established in  January of 1978.  Manitoba, Alberta  and B. C. are the only provinces  without councils.  Provincial Status of Women Councils  have been set up in response to  recommendations of the 1970 Royal  Commission into the Status of Women.  They are government, appointed  bodies, sometimes with one or two  salaried administrative positions.  Usually, they have a designated  minister to report to.  Although B.C. possesses no such  Status of Women Council, the provincial government did send a representative to the November meeting.  A Human Rights Officer, from the  Ministry of Labour.  Does this mean that Allan Williams,  our Minister of Labour, who operates  . the Human Rights Branch, accepts  some responsibility for the status  of women in B.C.?  WHAT DO PROVINCIAL COUNCILS DO?  What goes on at these joint council  meetings that might be useful to  B.C. women?  They review provincial and federal  activities - new legislation,  changes in legislation, issues under  discussion in the provinces, outbreaks of activity - which have  implications for other provinces.  What, for example, was the nature  of Ontario's legal advice that they  managed to use it to get various  levels of government to say NO to  the Storaska movie?  But why send a Human Rights Officer?  The Human Rights Branch does not have  any responsibility for global policy  on women's issues.  It has no man-  B.G Women Denied  Notional Voice  date from the provincial government  to develop policy on women's issues.  It has no one to report to about  such matters.  So what happens? A civil servant  gets a trip back east.  A report  gets filed and buried.  The Women  in B.C. who are actually working on  women's issues don't hear a whisper  of what went on.  OTTAWA MEETINGS  The other level of meetings that have  occurred have emanted from the office  of Marc Lalonde, the Federal Minister  responsible for the Status of Women.  He has a staff of civil servants,  headed by Julie Loranger, the Co-ordinator for the Status of Women. ,  Their current mandate is to develop  a National Plan of Action for the  International Decade of Women.  The feds called a meeting in February  to draw up plans around this issue.  This meeting was to be attended by  delegates from the provincial governments.  Whom does one invite from  B.C.?  Well, Allan Williams got dubbed in  again and so did Don Phillips, of  Economic Development.  Off to Ottawa  went a Human Rights Officer, this  time accompanied by Eileen Caner, from  the Ministry of Economic Development.  Caner has done some important work  on women in mining and she's something of a watchdog for the interests  of women in social and economic  development in the north.  But that's  a far cry from overall responsibility  for government action on status of  women issues.  SILENCE FROM WILLIAMS  Once more, no comments from the  Ministry of Labour to the women of B.C.  about what went on in Ottawa.  REPRESENTATION WITHOUT CONSENT  B.C.'s representation at national  meetings has been useless, both in  terms of impact within government and  on public awareness.  B.C. Women may  chose not to be represented on bodies  that raise dust within the halls of  Ottawa.  But right now we are being  represented without being told about  it.  PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL DISCRIMINATES & HOW!  Recently, Kinesis spoke with Gordon  Routley, a professional Employment  Counsellor in Vancouver.  He gave us  some interesting details about sex  discrimination practices in major  Vancouver employment agencies:  Professional Personnel, City Girl  Personnel and City Temps are all  divisions of Pacific Rim Management  Services Ltd.  These companies are  all owned and controlled by Mr.  Brian Goulding  Blatant  A female applicant applying for a job  through this agency is given a special application form to complete  (different from the male application).  Several discriminatory and irrelevant  questions are asked of the female  applicant.  IE:  age, height, weight,  marital status, maiden name, daycare  arrangements, ages of children,  citizenship, physical limitations  (if any) , amongst other irrelevant  queries prohibited by the Human  Rights Code of B. C.  The very fact.that Goulding has the  companies appropriately named —  Professional Personnel and City Girl  Personnel — smacks of his biases.  Can't a woman be a Professional?  I  wonder what would happen if a man  wandered in and asked to register  with City Girl.  Would he be  required to take a typing test and  devulge his maiden name?  The first clue you get into their  discriminatory practices occurs when  you observe that all female applicants are given scores of tests to  complete.  For example, they are  given an "Intelligence" test; a  "Bookkeeping" test (whether or not  you profess any knowledge of it);  a "Spelling" test; and the good ol'  "Typing" test (very, very important).  Secondly you will notice that very  few men are given tests.  In fact  the only one I ever observed administered to a man was the Intelligence test, and the man tested was  an East Indian person.  Stereotyping  On the reverse.side of the female  application form, is a "rating  form" to be completed by the  counsellor interviewing you.  The  counsellor must rate each female  applicant.as "excellent", "very  good", "good" or "fair" in the  following categories:  appearance  make-up  clothes  grooming    hair     personality  complexion  figure   maturity  No such rating form exists on the  reverse side of the male application form.  City Temps also discriminates.  They  have blue application forms for men  and pink application forms for  women.

At least 28 other  immigrant women have been deported  for failing to report the existence  of children in their country of  origin.  Under Bill C-24, a discriminatory  and racist immigration law, women  who acquire landed immigrant status  have to be "without minor children"  in the country of origin.  ANTI-IMMIGRATION REGULATIONS  On April 10, a new series of regulations come into effect under the  new immigration act.  These new  provisions claim to "tie immigration  to long-term demographic planning  and Canadian labour market needs."  According to Bud Cullen, Manpower  and Immigration Minister, new  immigrants worsen "the already  serious job situation", and are an  "economic and social burden."  The main thrust of the April 10  measures is to select immigrants  with professional training - vocational training and job experience  together account for a maximum of  23 points, while the maximum for  education has dropped from 20 to 12  points.  They also clamp down on immigrants  who are students.  Under the new  provisions, foreign students will  not be permitted to change either  their course of study or the  institution they attend without  government authorization.  Immigrants who leave Canada for "any  length of time" will have to reapply* for entry into Canada.  Visitors to Canada who find a job or  get accepted into a university will  have to go back to their own  country and apply for entry from  there.

It appeared for  months that Nellie's would be forced  to move, although no other location  could be found.  At the last moment,  a settlement was arranged.

Saskatoon Women's Liberation organized the weekend, the first of its  kind on the prairies.  They had  expected about 60 delegates, but  more than 130 women had registered  by the end of the weekend.  Workshops took place around such  topics as Bourgeois Feminism vs.  Socialist Feminist, Wages for Housework, Autonomy of the Women's Movement ....  Prairie Woman lists important areas  of debate about options for socialist  feminists.  THREE POSSIBILITIES:  -a revolutionary wing of the  broader movement be developed  with options open in the area  of formal alignments, informal  links or complete autonomy with  relations to established left  groups;      -a revolutionary women's party,  an avenue almost totally unexplored so far by most of us;  -development of revolutionary 'ñ†  politics within an autonomous  women's movement is diversionary  and divisive of the working  class struggle as the only  avenue for overthrow of the capitalist state.  Conference participant Liz Willick  commented: "The formulation of these  possibilities,  however sketchy, was  one of the crucial functions of the  conference. "  Willick also commented: "...at some  point,  we will have to come to grips  with the potentially thorny question  of whether there are not viable  alternatives to a Leninist/Vanguard  approach to revolution. "  Prairie Woman info.  Indian Women  in NB  The Tobique Indian Reserve in New Brunswick has been the scene of a desperate  struggle of Indian women for their  basic rights to housing.  When a marriage breaks up, it is the  wife and children who are forced to  leave the family home.  Thus there  are instances of a wife with many  children living in a trailer, while  a husband has the whole house to  himself.  At Tobique, most family houses are  held in the husband's name alone,  with a "certificate of possession"  held under his name.  BAND HALL OCCUPIED  Last September, several women and  their children moved into the Band  Hall because there was nowhere else  to go.  After a month's occupation,  they were forced out by an injunction.  The local office of the Department of  Indian Affairs refused to intervene  on the grounds that it was an  "internal affair" among Indian people.  An appeal to the New Brunswick Human  Rights Commission brought the  response that Indians come under  federal jurisdiction and that therefore New Brunswick "can't interfere".  PROVIDE HOUSING  The Tobique Indian women explain:  "We want the Department  (of Indian  Affairs and Northern Development)  to switch its priorities from  providing a high standard of living  for its mostly non-Indian civil  servants to providing housing for  Indian women. "  (info excerpted from NAC Status of  Women News)  Engineers'  SASKATCHEWAN WOMEN STUDENTS CHALLENGE  SEXISM  The Women's Directorate at the University of Saskatchewan has taken on the  sexist engineers there.  The Red Eye is the publication of the  Engineering Students Society there.  You can imagine the contents:  a  graphic of the "perfect woman" -  breasts, buttocks, pubic hair, legs  and no head.  A 'satire' on the Peanuts comic strip - Linus raping Lucy.  Graffiti example:  "They should  declare open season on faggots..."  Red Eye editor explains that boys will  be boys.  The Directorate sought support from  the Student Council to file a group  complaint to the Saskatchewan Human  Rights Commission, but their motion  was defeated.  Since then, approximately 20 individuals have filed complaints with the  Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission,  claiming that the sexism of The Red  Eye infringes on their human rights.  Prairie Woman info. e  UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN B.C,  It's out at last.  And as you may  have expected it's mostly bad news.  Of the sixty-eight recommendations  handed down to the provinces in 1970  by the Royal Commission on the  Status of Women, only sixteen have  been fully implemented.  The sixteen  being, of course, of minor significance.  Nevertheless, UPDATE ON THE STATUS  OF WOMEN IN B.C. is an essential  reference for all women in British  Columbia.  The report is divided  into four sections which deal with  women's concerns in the following  areas:  Labour, Education, Social  Services, and Family Law.  on the II Status of Women in British Columbia  The UPDATE Researchers  Within the Education Section, the  researchers take a look at such  areas as Textbooks, Family Life  Education, Native Women, Immigrant  Women and Educational Programmes  for Rural Women.  Women in Prisons, Police Search and  Custody Procedures, Day Care and  Birth Control Services are among  topics addressed in the Social  Services Section, while the Family  Law Section investigates such areas  as Support Obligations, Change of  Name and Matrimonial Property.  In each of the four sections there  are a number of subsections.  In  the Labour section, for example,  various subsections deal individually with each of the 20 recommendations from the Royal Commission.  Occupational training,  Maternity Rights and Part-time  Work are among the topics covered.  The UPDATE researchers evaluated the  issues relating to each recommendation and in many cases made their  own, alternate recommendation at  the end of each section.  Maternity  Rights, for example, makes 11  recommendations in response to the  one made by the Royal Commission.  It is interesting to note that  none of these women were "experts"  or "professionals" on the subjects  which they were required to research.  A postscript to the report discusses  in some detail the demystification of  research work in general, and in particular, in legal areas.  An extensive  bibliography is provided as well for  women who may be interested in doing  further research on any given topic.  METHODOLOGY  UPDATE researchers examined recommendations from the Royal Commission,  providing an up-to-date feminist  critique. For example, they found  that the original Royal Commission  recommendation on Maternity Rights  contained no protection against  dismissal on grounds of pregnancy  before maternity leave begins.  Then they provided extensive new  recommendations, including, for  example, a recommendation that the  Maternity Protection Act prohibit  dismissal on grounds of pregnancy  at any time.  UPDATE is published and is being  distributed.  The UPDATE Workers are  currently giving workshops about  their findings to interested women's  groups throughout the province.  The great UPDATE travelling workshops have so far been held in  Powell River, Courtenay, Queen  Charlotte Island, Dawson Creek, Fort  St. John and Fort Nelson.  Kinesis asked some of the UPDATE  workers how the workshops had been  received:  "People have been interested.    The  workshops have not only made the  information available,  but have  provoked discussion on local issues. "  "We wanted UPDATE to be used as a  resource.     We weren't primarily  interested in providing yes or no  answers to the question of the  amount of provincial response to  specific recommendations of the  Royal Commission.     We tried to  discuss the issues,  to present  various viewpoints,  and to include  issues that had been ignored by the  Commission."  "We have really enjoyed meeting the  women in different centres,  and  sharing information and energy  together."  "Given further funding,  we will continue to offer to do workshops  both in the Lower Mainland and  throughout the province. "  The UPDATE researchers will be holding a workshop at Vancouver Status  of Women on April 20 at 7.30pm.  Anyone who is interested is very  welcome.

Abortion is available in most B.C.  hospitals, but the frequently arbitrary interpretation of abortion laws  is forcing women to endure delays  which are physically risky and more  emotionally traumatic.  FINDINGS  These are the findings of the recently published B.C. Federation of Women  Abortion Availability Survey, a comprehensive collection of practical  information on B.C. hospitals' regulations , interpretation of the abortion law and counselling services.  The survey concludes that delays are  unacceptable and must be drastically  reduced to ensure abortions can be  obtained, preferably before 8 weeks  of pregnancy and without question  before 12 weeks.  The problems confronting a woman  seeking an abortion are largely avoidable, the health sub-committee points  out. Women are not always able to  get reliable information on abortion  in their area, and in fact may be  given mis-information by an unsympathetic doctor, such as that abortion  is illegal. Even with a sympathetic  doctor, she must meet arbitrarily-  decided requirements and then wait for  approval from the hospital's therapeutic abortion committee.  Two-week  delays are the absolute minimum a  woman must expect to endure, and much  longer waiting periods are common.  HUSBAND'S CONSENT  Although it is not required by law,  husband's consent for an abortion is  demanded in 20 out of 35 hospitals  surveyed.  In 9 of these hospitals,  legal papers were necessary to prove  separation.  by  Federation of Women Health  Sub-Committee  "As it is, the abortion situation in  B.C. puts women in a degrading, powerless position, subject to the personal  and often arbitrary predispositions of  mainly male lawmakers and medical  personnel," said Jenna Jordinson of  the health sub-committee.  "Whether a woman can get an abortion  depends on chance and luck, depending  on where she lives and the personal  sympathies of her doctor." Many  unsympathetic doctors refuse to recommend to a woman a doctor who will help  her.  The survey recommends that the decision be made by a woman and her doctor, not the. abortion committee — a  procedure which would reduce the debilitating delays now common.  In addition, if small hospitals and general  practitioners would take responsibility for performing early abortion  instead of relying on large referral  hospitals and gynecologists, delays  would be cut even further.  Women living in Kelowna, the Fraser  Canyon and Sidney are virtually unable to obtain a safe, legal operation  opisH-LCMCN- i wink vfc'Ke all  ^- % THB ABORtON ISSUE...  in their home area. The non-cooperative hospitals in question are Kelowna  General Hospital, Fraser Canyon Hospital and Rest Haven Hospital in  Sidney.  RESIDENCY  Thirteen out of 36 hospitals surveyed  required abortion patients to be resir  dents of their areas, for periods  ranging from three months to up to two  years before the 12th week of pregnancy, although obtaining an abortion  locally within that time period is  made almost impossible. This means  women must face costly and time-consuming travel to a larger centre.  Some centers surveyed reported a complete lack of publicly-available information on birth control.  "It is  appalling that there is no attempt to  obviate the necessity for abortion by  providing birth control information  and encouraging responsible attitudes," says Jacqueling Simpson,  health committee chairperson.  "Even  when birth control is used conscientiously, there is still the possibility of unplanned pregnancy: legal  abortion must be available for backup to all women quickly and must in  no way be labeled a crime."  RESOURCE  The survey, which was designed to  serve as a resource for women seeking  abortion, will be distributed to appropriate resource centres around the  province. Its purpose is to compare  conditions in B.C. hospitals and act  as a motivating force to ensure that  all women have access to safe, legal  abortion, as well as proper emotional  and birth control counselling.

ANTI-CHOICC ACTION  PROTECT WAWENS RI6HTS  pef4MAtf/mzzm\m ncw seewiai  The probably imminent Federal elections will find anti-abortionists  joining political parties in an attempt to vote in anti-choice candidates.  Allegations have been made that this  is what happened in the new riding  of Richmond-South Delta. Joan Wallace,  defeated Liberal candidate, founding  member of VSW and a supporter of a  woman's right to choose, was defeated  by Tony Schmand, a so-called "Pro-  lifer."  Some anti-abortionists are said to be  joining more than one party to send  a "pro-lifer" to parliament, regardless of which party wins.  Meanwhile, anti-abortionists in Prince  George have been offering cash for  fetuses, through an ad. campaign entitled " Babies Ransom Fund". ft  Successes OF MARCH 8 - CVALUATCD  Any assessment of the International  Women's Day organizing this year  can only be good.  I would like to  describe and evaluate not only the  March 8 activities themselves but  the internal workings of the organizing committee as well.  Two important things about the  internal organization:  1. While the women involved tried  new structures and organizational  techniques which proved effective,  we consciously maintained gains  that the women's movement has made  to date. For example, while we adopted a structured decision-making  process, with limited discussion  periods and a 2/3 majority vote,  we also maintained, as essential to  the assurance of internal democracy  and to breakdown further the personal/political split which we are  all conditioned to, the necessity  of clearing sessions as an integral part of each meeting.  There are certain guidelines to help  us through some of the dangers or  pitfalls we encounter in our organizing. These ideas were conscious  and acted upon to varying degrees in  this year's March 8 organizing.  They contributed to making the celebrations a success. Highlighted  also are some of our shortcomings  in these areas.  1. It is important to be INCLUSIVE  in our organizing if we want to increase participation in the women's  movement.  In our organizing women of all political persuasions, so long as they  are in support of women's liberation,  should not only be allowed, but should be encouraged to participate.  Many of us are aware of the tensions  which surrounded and still haunt the  WAR organizing. The absence of certain women from the IWD organizing,  feminists who have been active in  Vancouver for quite some time, may  HeRe 6 Our ccwarje VLqSSO\a, a 9ooD fmfPR  fleUAftfi IN tWe FIGPL CUtVefi AGAINSt our eNeMW And  OTAeRS Lite HeK -fteUt-teNac/ouSLL/ RoiaRLU rin*n?/v/  tn CHiue,TMaiL3NP anp soutM afi&v^omi>cl£V€^Ly,  SAN JUAN aMP C\£S£lAHV KCPr  ALL ttte VLaSSOVdS Of ALL COUfttRlP^  UNKVOWO  5DLPJeRSGPtHE f^VOLUhcn  INPISF£NS\BLe. ^^JLur/QN,  -FROAft 'HUe /WneR" BH   BfegtoU-   BreOHr-  2. There was a real attempt to  broaden the activities to those outside the already organized women's  movement. This attempt was both conscious and structural. The committee  itself was what was termed an 'open'  committee, meaning that both groups  and individuals outside the British  Columbia Federation of Women (BCFW)  were invited to participate.  Participation in both the information day and the parade was seen  as involving many groups and individuals with the sole provision  that individuals there supported  women's liberation.  Mistakes, if we can call them such,  were made in the course of our  organizing. We should not exaggerate these mistakes: this year's activities have brought the women's  movement forward. There was substantial learning and sharing of organizational skills, and on the level  of consciousness, the attempt to  broaden, though not entirely successful, is the.most significant advance.  be at least partially the result of  these tensions. If this is the case,  it is tragic that these women did  not participate in IWD organizing-  tragic in both a personal and organizational sense.  Those women who view the absence of  others with differing political conceptions as an advantage in organizing a mass action or movement are  totally mistaken. This conception  can only come from the fact that  they would rather win their sister  organizers to their own views than  build a movement of women based on  women's liberation.  Socialist-Feminists  Dominant ?  The organizing committee this year  was composed to a large extent of  women who could in varying ways be  called socialist-feminists, and the  organizing committee erred in adopt  ing an almost exclusively socialist-  feminist perspective.  Where Were Other  Sections  Of The Movement ?  This perspective was especially evident in the literature that went  out in the name of the committee.  The absence of women in the committee who hold the view that MAN is the  enemy was viewed by those who hold  the view that CAPITALISM is the  enemy as an opportunity to hegemon-  ize the organizing, perspective, literature and public face of the women's movement with their own ideology.  This had no disasterous effects in  the organizing this year, but could,  if it continues, be a drawback to  building the women's movement.  Assessment  Of The Internal  Organizing Of IWD  by Patty Clark  The women's movement must hold a feminist perspective. That is - women  are oppressed.in society, so what are  we going to do about it? Not a socialist, separatist or radical feminist  perspective, each of which would bar  the participation of women of other  political ideas as well as being a  stumbling block to women coming to  a feminist consciousness.  Our organizing committee should have  made a special attempt at involving  those women who were conspicuously  absent and who have contributed so  much to the women's movement in Vancouver in the past.  2. We must not let ideological debate preclude activitly or organization for successful activitity.  We have not yet.learned how to deal'  successfully with differences that  arise in the course of our organizing,  The few issues in which conflicts  arose in the committee led to some  turn to p.   15  ... CAMPBELL  RIVER  In protest against the sexual  harassment of two femal workers,  members of the International  Woodworkers of America (IWA) shut  down a Campbell River sawmill Feb.  17th. The strike lasted six days.  118 workers refused to cross a  citizens' picket set up in front of  Raven Lumber by local women.  The  dispute concerns two part-time  women workers who had been doing  relief work at the mill on weekends.  One of the women has charged in a  written statement that the supervisor had offered her Scotch, had  kissed her and grabbed at her  breasts.  The supervisor allegedly  propositioned one woman repeatedly,  even following her to her home to  do so.  The strikers are demanding the  dismissal of the supervisor and the  immediate re-instatement of the two  women.  LRB INQUIRY  The B. C. Labour Relations Board  announced February 22 that it would  appoint a three-man panel to investigate the situation at Raven Lumber.  Watch next month's Kinesis for an  - update   What It Is  Sexual harassment is a term which  refers to unwanted sexual advances  like leering, ogling, touching,  pinghing, verbal innuendo, pro-  positing. ..  It's been going on since women  started waged work, but women are  just beginning to speak out against  it.  Women have been isolated in  their jobs and therefore afraid to  speak up.  Most often, the offender  waits until there is nobody else  around.  There is the humilating  fear that the harassment is  impossible to prove, and will be seen  as trivial.  Most importantly, there  is the fear of job loss.  How It Works  Sexual harassment in the workplace  reinforces women's subordination on  the job and in society as a whole.  It derives from the myth that men  are naturally aggressive and that  women's sexuality is a commodity to  be bought and sold.  We are treated  as decorations on the job place and  then made to feel guilty for being  objectified.  In particular, sexual harassment  helps shore up the sexually segregated job market, in which male  bosses control women workers.  It  undermines our already insecure  position:  we have to 'put out or  get out'.  SEXUAL HARASSMENT  IT'S LIKE RAPE  "Sexual harassment is like rape  because women are afraid to file  complaints - afraid of employer  retaliation and social repercussions",  said a US lawyer for their Equal  Employment Opportunities Commission.  "In rape,  a man overpowers a woman  with brute strength or a weapon.    In  sexual harassment,  he overpowers her  economically and threatens loss of  livelihood. "  "I went to the personel manager with  a complaint that two men were propositioning me",  wrote a factory  worker. "He promised immediate  action.    When ■! got up to leave,  he  grabbed my breast and said,   'Be nice  to me and I'll take care of you. '"  This is one of the responses from a  recent Redbook survey, which  revealed that 90% of its 9000 respondents experienced sexual harassment on the job.  The survey showed that the majority  of women reporting sexual harassment  were married women fh clerical work  who earned between $5000 and $10,000  a year.  The men responsible for the harassment are always in positions 'superior to the women - supervisors,  bosses and sometimes customers.  They can put economic pressure on  the woman.  A US group, the Working Women United  Institute, (WWUI), which has investigated the problem extensively,"  reports that women workers are in  fact penalized for not responding  positively to sexual advances on the  job.  They say that in 75% of the  cases where women tried to ignore  the harassment, it got worse.  Calgary Status of Women Action Committee has prepared a brief dealing  with legal protection against sexual  harassment in employment.  "None of us feels legislation will  end sexual harassment",   comment  Committee members, "but we do feel  that by its very introduction,  legislation would act as a possible  preventative measure - a type of  deterrent.... Our concern is to see  legislative action which will at  least provide the possibility of  redress. "  mr*  "Mr. Baker, I've just divorced one of 'God's gifts to women.'  And for the time being, I'm returning further packages unopened."  The Facts  An informal survey conducted by the  Working Women United Institute during  May, 1975, resulted in the first  statistics ever compiled about sexual  harassment.  There were 155 respondents whose ages ranged from 19 to 65.  The definition of sexual harassment  used in this survey was "any repeated  and unwanted sexual comments, looks,  suggestions or physical contact that  you find objectionable or offensive  and causes you discomfort on your  job".  Some of the findings as reported in  "Do It Now", June, 1977, are as  follows:  1. Sexual harassment is widespread.  70% of the women sampled had  experienced it at least once.  2. Women from all ages and marital  status, job categories and pay  ranges experience sexual harassment on the job. - there is some  indication that waitresses and  clerical workers are more likely  to be harassed than women in  other job categories.  3. 91% of sexual harassment is  verbal.  4. If sexual harassment is ignored,  it does not stop. - 75% of the  cases where the woman ignored it,  the behavior continued or got  worse.  5. Most women do not make formal  complaints about sexual harassment. - the most common reasons  women gave for not complaining  were that they believed:  a. nothing would be done about  it (52%) .  b. it would be treated lightly  or they would be ridiculed  (43%).  c. they would be blamed or there  would be some repercussions  (30%).  6.  Of those cases where the victim  complained through established  channels, no action was taken  in over half the cases.  '7.  In 1/3 of the cases where the  victim complained through  channels, negative repercussions  resulted.  8. Sexual harassment has an emotional  effect on yhodr eho experience  it. - specific effects women  reported included:  a. becoming more self-conscious  about their appearance.  b. feeling trapped or powerless.  c. feelings of defeat and  diminished ambition.  d. decreased job satisfaction  and impairment of job performance .  e. physical symptoms including  nervous stomachs, migrane  headaches and loss Of appetite.  9. Sexual harassment on the job is  a serious problem. - 92% of the  respondents considered it a  serious problem.  Some comments from the Women's  Division of the Saskatchewan Department of Labour place the problem  in its Canadian perspective:  In Canada  Under The Fair Employment Practices  Act, an employer cannot discriminate  against any employee on the basis of  sex.  However, sexual harassment is  not spelled out clearly which makes  it difficult to enforce.  The Canada Employment Centre  (formerly the Unemployment Insurance  Commission) does not have a standard  policy which considers sexual harassment "just cause" for quitting a job.  What they will do is have you talk  to one of their investigators who  will, depending on how well you  convince that person, grant you  immediate coverage.  Unfortunately  this seems to be a hit and miss  proposition; most investigators, it  would seem, do not take such cases  seriously.  (If you prefer to talk  to a femal investigator, you can  request one.)  It will help your  case if you can argue that you did  everything you could do rectify the  situation before it got so bad that  you had to quit — ie. you talked  the problem over with your employer,  that you did not consider any  sexual advances either on his part  or someone else's, as something that  "went with the job."  Up to now, the above prospects were  not too encouraging.  We are informed that the federal Human Rights  Act will incorporate the notion of  sexual harassment.  It is still  left open for interpretation and we  are awaiting word from the federal  Human Rights Commission to see what  the scope of the legislation will  entail.  Up to now, there has been  no legal precedent set in Canada —  such a case has never been taken  through the courts.  What is important is that women are  starting to talk about this widespread problem, and are bringing the  issue out in the open. When sexual  harassment is exposed and is taken  serious _, then the chances of  getting support and proper action  against such injustice is much  greater.

But now the Commission is  examining the possibility of establishing a clearer jurisdictional  position.  The Commission's main  consideration is whether sexual  harassment is a form of sex discrimination and therefore specifically covered by the Alberta  Individual's Rights Protection Act.  The recent US court decision  recognizing sexual harassment as a  form of sex discrimination (see  story about Yale students, below)  will have some influence here in  Canada.  IN BRITISH COLUMBIA  The B. C. Human Rights Branch has  investigated several complaints of  sexual harassment.  There have, however, been no public cases to date,  and none of the cases have gone to  a Board of Inquiry.  One major snag  is that there has to have been a  witness to the harassment, or other  employees willing to come forward  as victims of similar harassment  from the same offender.  What You Con Do  1. Make it plain from the start that  you do not regard your sexuality  as something you have sold to the  employer.  Object to jokes about  your sexuality, and about other  women's sexuality.  2. Object to any form of sexual  harassment to other fellow  employees.  Speak up loudly about  it in some place where you  gather - such as the coffee-room.  3. If you become a victim of sexual  harassment, place a complaint  before the B.C. Human Rights  Branch. Let other workers know  that complaints can be made. Be  sure to write a letter of formal  complaint to the employer.  4. Should you lose your job, raise  a stink.  Sue for damages.  Picket the employer to embarass  him publicly...  5. Try to get a clause into your  union contract probiting sexual  harassment.  VSW  A woman came to Vancouver Status of  Women recently with the following  account:  She had quit her job  because of sexual harassment.  When  she applied for Unemployment Insurance however, they claimed that she  did not have 'just cause' for  quitting, because she had not  written a letter of formal complaint to the employer. *&  Women and Unemployment  After the Throne Speech, made by the Premier to mark the resumption of sessions at the Legislature,  the NDP moved a vote of non-confidence against it. Rosemary Brown  (Vancouver Burrard -  NDP) proposed an amendment to the no-confidence vote, charging the Socreds with embarking upon  a programme of deliberate discrimination against women. Her amendment triggered lengthy  debate in the House about women and unemployment,  the neglect of child care services by the  Socreds, anti-union discrimination,   lack of apprenticeship training. And the Vancouver  Status of Women. Here 's excerpts of what we heard about ourselves on April 4:  EILEEN DAILLY (Burnaby North NDP):  "...it's becoming increasingly obvious that the impact of unemployment in British Columbia and across  Canada is being felt most strongly  by young people and by women. Discrimination against women in the  workforce is once again beginning  to surface openly...  "Yet what has happened? The Minister  of Travel Industry (Hon.Mrs Mc Car-  thy), who happens also to be in  charge of dispersing grants, has  seen fit to give at this crucial time  for women only half the annual required budget to the Vancouver Stati s  of Women, an organization that is  needed at this time, Mr.Speaker,  more than ever before. It was a shameful decision, when, at the same time,  we find that this same minister has  spent $80,000 on hospitality certificates ...where are the priorities of  this government?"  DAILLY contined with a description  of unemployment amongst women: we  make up 36.9% of the entire Canadian  labour force; but we're 44.2% of  the official unemployed. She concluded:  "...the idea that women today are  working for frills and luxuries...  and are therefore secondary earners,  is increasingly being perpetuated by  governments, media and right-wing  elements in our Canadian society.  This pressure on women to return to  the^home has been exerted throughout  Canadian history whenever jobs are  scarce'"     Dailly  ROSEMARY BROWN (Vancouver Burrard  NDP) "...the Status of Women council  received a letter from the Provincial  Secretary (Hon, Mrs McCarthy) on  March 23, because they had written  her on March 17 to say in view of the  fact that the $75,000 would force  them to fire two of their workers, because it wasn't quite enough...the  Provincial Secretary responded by saying... in a nutshell...if you don't  want "the grant, there are a lot of  other people around who could use the  money...that's a really warm, compassionate kind of response, isn't it?  "The suggestion was made that they  should apply to outside funding, they  should try some of the foundations,  the community support. This shows that  she didn't read their brief, because  they were very clear in the brief  about foundations and other community groups that they had tried to tap,  including City Council, Secretary of  State, and various other groups...  they're an advocacy group. They fight  for women, and as such they do not  fit into the funding criteria of ...  the Koerner Foundation or the Vancouver Foundation...They tried, and they  made it absolutely clear in their  appeal to the Provincial Secretary  that they had tried these other areas.  They do get some money from memberships ...but because they address themselves to a constituency that is for  the most part poor, there's isn't any  money out there.  Oil Company Grants  That is the reason it really irks me,  Mr Speaker, when someone gets up in  this House and talks about the grant  mentality. If they had the grant mentality, they would have the grant in  the same way that the oil companies  and the mining companies and the large  corporations get the grant.  "But it's because they work with and  for dispossessed people that they are  not having at least as much money assigned to them as is assigned to the  printing and distributing of hospitality certificates...  The Ombudsman  Excuse  "Mr.Speaker, the Vancouver Status of  Women have been told that when the ombudsman has been chosen for the province, the ombudsman would be able  to do the job which is presently being done by the ombudservice. This  shows again that the minister has not  read the report. If she had read the  report she would see that the kind of  job carried out by the ombudservice  has nothing to do with fighting bureaucracy .  "It deals with problems of isolation,  marital stress, inflation, reduced  hope for jobs, lack of education, and  personal problems. These are not touched by an ombudsman. The aim is to  bring women together in their own communities to share experience and to  seek seek solutions...  Health Collective  "I would like to talk about another  group, the Women's Health Collective.  ...The Women's Health Collective is  in a serious situation'because the  Minister of Human Resources has seen  fit to withdraw the salary of one person who used to work with them. So  already they are one person short.  They have long waiting lists... Again  they are finding that in terms of  the priorities of this government,  they are not considered to be important. They have still not heard the .  word from the minister (Minister of  Health Hon.McMcClelland) about whether  their budget is going to be met or  not. This is not a criticism of the  minister. They have met with the minister; he was warm and sympathetic  and understanding. They state very  clearly that he understands their dilemma. The dilemma that they have is  with the government that sees that it  is more important to put money into  things than it is to put money into  people, even if it is involved in  such a thing as preventive services  and certainly in terms of preventive  health services."  Cocke  DENNIS COCKE (New Westminster NDP)  " ...Mr Speaker, go around and talk  to the women in this province, the  women who are really suffering the  greatest burden of all, with the  possible exception of youth...  What do we hear in response from  this government? .. .The. Minister of  Travel Industry and Provincial Secretary, Mrs.McCarthy tells all the  women of this province: "I made it,  girls. So can you." That's kind of  faint hope for most of the people,  particularly...when there just are  not the jobs. One job for every 30  applicants, and most of those applicants are women...a great many  of those are the first earner in the  family. The first earner of the family, 46% of them, and they have been  sold out...  "Seme of the areas where the Vancouver Status of Women work..is in their  skill-sharing... these are the very  areas where women require assistance.  Mr.Speaker, the government says that  we're going to hold them down to the  same level as they were in 1975, and  prior. No thought in terms of inflation. No thought in terms of an increas'  ed need. No thought in terms of the  fact that we're in tougher times now  ...I'm scared of a government that  has absolutely no sense at all in  terms of producing direction, and  they've exhibited that best by turning their backs on the women, the women who are trying their very best  to help one another.-."   cont.in col 2sp.20 15  MARCH 8 EVALUATIONS  cont. from p.11  degree of paralysis during which subcommittees and individuals became disoriented and were undermined.  During one period the organizing  committee went through three weeks of  discussion, during which time the subcommittees could not act effectively.  We must learn what basis on which  we are uniting and act on that basis,  compromising views where necessary so  that the work can go forward.  One case in point is a debate on the  contents of the letter to invite groups to participate in the parade. The  disagreement was about how to word  the letter in regards to men's participation. The most extreme views  were:  a. we want only a few men  b. we want the participation of any  man who supports women's liberation.  The final debate was whether or not  we would say, "this is a women's action primarily, so keep the women to  men ratio proportionate", or "men  can participate but not on the floats".  The second of these proposals was finally adopted. On the day of the parade,  however, men were on the mobile vehicles. One man was in a pickup with  several children, helping them blow  their whistles. No woman seemed to  object. The argument of those against  the first proposal was that it would  limit the participation of some groups,  In actuality, it seems a moot point  which of the two mutations is better,  yet this argument spanned two if not  three organizing meetings.  3. Finances are an integral part of  our organizing, not only because we  need a certain amount of money to do  what we want to do but because the  soliciting and financial support (along with endorsements) helps to make  our presence known. Each group which  we approach for financial backing will  need to discuss us. In the case of  leader-member bodies such as trade  unions, the appeal may be brought to  the membership for discussion or alternately, women within the union  may be able to force the discussion  based on the appeal.  We need money to plan and accomplish  our activities. Shutting our eyes to  this necessity solves no problems.  Soliciting money broadly gets us  more of the attention we need in order  to attract as many women as possible.  IWD Committee's Comment  Two weeks after March 8, the Vancouver International Women's Day  Organizing Committee held its  evaluation.  by Janet Sawyer  It was pointed out, however, that an  organizing committee basically provides  a structure and gets others to do the  work.  Those who attended were mainly the  members of the Committee, so, lacking outside reaction, this was an  IWD evaluation of how well we did  our job.  The first issue raised was the childcare at Information Day, March 5.  It was badly organized, and quite  chaotic. Owing originally to a  misunderstanding with In Struggle,  we had the classic situation where  everyone thinks someone else is in  charge.  Specifically, we needed more than  two people per shift. We needed a  place where kids could take a nap.  Rules for parents (e.g. sign-in  and sign-out) needed to be clearer,  and to be enforced.  In the future it seems that there  should be a couple of people whose  specific, responsibility is the childcare, so that we know the job is  getting done.  The Committee did a round for an  overall evaluation:  We all agreed that the IWD events were  successes, and we all admitted that  we didn't expect such success.  JUST GOT LUCKY  Many felt that to a certain extent  at least, we just got lucky.  We did virtually nothing about finances until the benefit dance bailed  us out by netting enough $s to cover  everything, and then some.  The sun came out for March 8, and people showed up in the right spirit.  But our publicity was spotty, and generally rather late. Indeed, we only  had leaflets to hand out at the parade because some dedicated women at  Press Gang, on their own initiative,  stayed up all night before the parade to make them.  The test of good organizing is in the  results, and by that test we did fine.  Superhuman efforts by a couple of people, plus the work of various groups,  made for a good Information Day. Childcare was the only real problem.  Things that particularly pleased people about Information Day:  2 GAINS  - the participation of Third World  groups, immigrant women and unions;  - the relative painlessness of contacting organized left groups.  Several positive comments were made on  the participation of men in all activities . It seemed generally felt that  men did contribute without taking over.  One woman remarked on how nice it was  to be at a dance with men ndt hassling  women and lots of lesbians there having  a good time.  We were all delighted by the parade.  It was also unanimous that there should  have been some ending to tie it together  singing, a rally, whatever. Some still  regretted holding the parade on a weekday, as it limited the participation of  working women - "Think how many more we  could have had on a Saturday!" Others  were glad we chose Wednesday, partly  because it was International Women's Day  and also because Georgia Street on a  weekday lunch hour is when all the downtown workers are there to see us go by  and hear what we have to say.  US€D TH€ MCDIA  The IWD Organizing Committee had decided  to try and use all the media we could  get to publicize our action.  People felt that, considering who the  established media are, our coverage was  pretty good.      tupn ^ pm20,  col 1 MATTIE GUNTEDMAN  Henri  Robicteau  Mattie Gunterman was born Ida Madeline  Warner sometime during May 1872 in La  Crosse, Wisconsin, a town on the Mississippi River.  At that time La Crosse  was an important lumber manufacturing  center to which many German and Norwegian immigrants were drawn.  Nothing  is known of Mattie's family or childhood.  Around 1890 she left her home  and travelled west to the fledgeling  city of Seattle, Washington.  There she met Bill Gunterman, a candy  maker.  They were married December 19,  1891.  Bill was five years older than  Mattie and had come from a large  family.  He was born in Iowa but was  raised in Santa Barbara, California  until the age of 17 when his family  moved to Seattle.  Bill's mother  later owned and operated hotels in  Seattle, including the Grand Central  Hotel which still stands today near  Pioneer Square.  During her first few years in Seattle,  Mattie, like millions of other people  was caught up in the "Kodak" craze.  George Eastman's new camera and film  had opened up the world of snapshot  photography to everyone with the  statement, "You push the button, we  do the rest."  The "Kodak" was  Mattie's introduction to photography.  Her interest was further inspired  by her brother-in-law Frank Smith,  an avid amateur photographer.  He  instructed her in the use of the  5x7 dry plate camera as well as  the techniques of developing and  printing.  On October 20, 1892, Mattie gave birth  to their only child, Henry.  Bill  continued to run a candy shop with  his brother Arthur during the lean  years of the mid 1890's.  In Seattle's  wet climate Mattie developed what  was thought to have been tuberculosis  and was advised to move to a dryer  place.  She was not expected to live.  In 1898 they packed up their  possessions, including Mattie's new  5x7 camera,and left Seattle looking  for a new home.  Their destination,  determined by the flip of a coin, was  Thompson's Landing (later Beaton),  British Columbia, where Mattie's  cousin Hattie Needham lived.  Bill, Mattie, five year old Henry,  two dogs and horse 'Nellie', walked  a good deal of the more than five  hundred miles.  They followed the  main transportation routes in order  to find work as they went.  In  Washington they travelled along  the Great Northern railroad line, the  Columbia and Okanagan Rivers to the  Canadian border at Osoyoos.  From  there they followed the Dewdney  Trail east to the southern end of  Mattie Gunterman photo  the Arrow Lakes where they caught  the sternwheelers for Arrowhead and  finally Thompson's Landing, arriving  mid summer 1898.  Mattie's "tuberculosis" had disappeared.  She was  later known to say, "Get out and get  the fresh air and you will be all  right regardless of what is the matter  with you".  Thompson's Landing at that time was  a transportation transfer point for  people heading to the Lardeau mining  boom-towns of Trout Lake and Ferguson.  The boom, which started about 1897,  was small compared to the Klondike  gold rush and had a different kind  of atmosphere. Whole families came  rather than all single men, making  for a more sociable community.  Picnics, outings and dances were  frequent and well attended.  There  was always the general boom-town  rowdiness but it was balanced and  partially subdued by the familial  presence.  Pioneer Photos  The Guntermans with the help of their  new neighbours set about clearing  land and building their log house.  During this time Bill worked for a  short while in Nakusp at the Yale-  Columbia sawmill.  The house was  finished by 1899, complete with  adjoining shed where Mattie had her  darkroom.  There she developed and  printed the photographs of her new  friends, experiences and explorations  into the wilderness.  Henri Robideau print  As the boom continued there were  plenty of jobs in the mining camps.  In the Winter of 1902 Mattie worked  as a cook at the Nettie-L mine  above Ferguson.  For the miners the  work was always backbreaking, but  the labour unions were finally winnin  the eight hour day with three dollars  a day as top pay for hard-rock miners.  An eight hour day for the miners meant  a twelve-to-fourteen hour day for the  kitchen crew. When the day's work  was finished, any energy left was  spent having fun.  Games invented for  entertainment were limited only by  the imagination and personal morals  of the participants.  Camborne, five miles up the Fish River  from Beaton, got a late start in the  boom as it wasn't until 1901 that a  wagon road was finally blasted through  the treacherous Fish River canyon,  opening up the area to mining and  logging.  Bill and Mattie then found  work there closer to home at Hillman  and Beaton's logging camp during  1903 and 1904.  The logs cut there  went to the sawmill at Comaplix  across the lake from Beaton.  Comaplix  which had a large East Indian labour  force manufactured lumber for the  mines and for shipment to the prairies.  Dances and masquerade balls were held  regularly, each town trying to  outdo the other.  Reduced rates on  the stages were offered as an inducement to bring people in from the  surrounding communities.  Inclement  weather seldom put a damper on things,  the merry-makers braving even the worst winter conditions.  The usual program  consisted of the opening grand march  of couples at 8 P.M., then dancing  until midnight when a banquet was  served, followed by the continuance  of dancing until daylight.  Mattie  and Bill were famous for their  dancing abilities and it was said  that, "To watch Mr. and Mrs. Gunterman  dance the French Minuet and Spanish  Waltz was to understand what dancing  could be." Mattie was especially  fond of teaching people how to dance.  She transformed many a stumble-footed  miner into a tripper of the light  fantastic.  In 1905 Bill, Mattie and Henry headed  south on a trip to visit friends and  relatives.  Besides his familv in the  Seattle area, Bill had a brother and  sister in San Francisco and another  sister in Los Angeles.  Mattie of  course took her camera along and  photographed their travels.  She was  particularly inspired by the San  Francisco area as a majority of her  photographs from the trip are of  places around the Bay area.  Boom Over  On their return to Beaton it was  obvious the boom was over.  Few  new mines were opening and the  ones already running were having  a difficult time staying operative.  The mines couldn't make a profit  even though they contained abundant  quantities of minerals.  The ore  had to be mined, brought down the  mountains, transported to the lake,  loaded on barges, towed to the  railhead, loaded on railcars and  finally delivered to the smelter  which was over one hundred miles  from the mines.  The cost of  transportation was greater than  the value of the refined metals.  There was much talk of the railroad coming in but it never did.  Mining activity began to decrease,  people started to move away.  The  few jobs available were in the  logging camps but even these  couldn't sustain the situation very  long.  By 1910 the exodus was turning  Ferguson, Trout Lake and Camborne  into ghost towns.  Beaton, however,  wasn't as badly hurt as it remained  a transportation point and some light  farming was being undertaken.  The Guntermans stayed in Beaton but  their lives were changing too.  Henry at 17 began leaving home  periodically roaming the province  and the state of Washington looking  for work.  The Guntermans worked  wherever they could find it.  From  the fall of 1910 until the,spring  of 1911 Mattie worked at the Summit  Mine in Sheep Creek.  A trap line  plus hunting and fishing supplemented  their income.  Mattie's photography  became more casual and less  frequent.  She started using a  lighter roll film camera, sending out  her film to Revelstoke Pharmacy for  processing.  WW 2  With the coming of the First World Wai  the last embers of the Lardeau boom  were snuffed out.  On April 15, 1915,  the entire town of Comaplix and the  sternwheeler 'Revelstoke' were  consumed in flame, putting a sudden  and complete end to the local logging  possibilities.  1915 also saw the  marriage of Henry Gunterman to  Petranella Quackenbush.  Henry and  Petranella had three children, two  girls and a boy.  Their first girl  died as a baby in 1918.  In the early 1920*s the Guntermans  travelled to Vulcan, Alberta, cooking  for the crews during wheat harvest  time.  A tragic fire in 1927 burned  Bill and Mattie's cottage to the  ground.  Lost were all of Mattie's  photographic equipment, cameras,  prints, negatives, everything.  Only  her glass plate negatives stored  separately in the old shed survived.  The 1930's saw a short resurgence of  mining activity in Camborne but the  same problems of transportation once  again defeated the attempt.  On  December 19, 1935, the business  district of Beaton was destroyed by  fire.  In February of 1936 Bill  dropped dead of a heart attack out  in the bush while hauling logs with  his horse.  Bill's death didn't seem  to slow Mattie down.  She continued  taking brisk hikes to visit friends,  went fishing, and tended her garden.  During the Second World War, her  grandson/ Avery, was in the Canadian  Army in Europe.  In May 1945 word came  through that the war in Europe was  over and that Avery would be coming  home.  With great excitment, Mattie  set about cleaning and fixing up the  house for his return.  She overworked  herself and one morning Henry woke up  to find his mother on the floor of her  room.  Mattie was dead at the age of  73.  .Mattie was remembered as "a wonderful  person, always so kind to anyone she  thought was lonely.  Her motto was to  do kind things for people close by,  hoping that someone would do kind  things for her friends far away."  Epilogue  In 1961 Ron D'Altroy of the Historical  Photograph Section of the Vancouver  Public Library received a tip that a  caretaker of the Sunshine Lardeau Mine  in Camborne had a wealth of historical  material about the area.  Ron's  friend Bruce Ramsey was heading up  into this area to do research for his  book, Ghost Towns of British Columbia  so Ron and Bruce went up together.  When they arrived it turned out that  the "wealth of historical material'  was not much more than' a pile of old  Time magazines and National Geographies.  Feeling somewhat distraught, they went  to the beer parlour in Beaton.  There  they were told of an old prosepctor  and trapper named Henry Gunterman, who  had lived in that area most of his life.  They found him, and started talking with  him explaining what they were doing.  Suddenly, out of the blue, Henry said  his old mother took a lot of pictures  on glass and that they were around  the place somewhere.  Ron's heart  began to thump.  After a short search  Ron climbed up a rickety ladder in an  old shed and there in the loft that  had once been Mattie's darkroom was  an apple crate full of glass plates.  Rats had built a nest on top of the  create, covering it with a dome of  droppings.  This had caused the  plates to stick together in lumps.  Ron looked at only a couple of the  negatives but realized what a fantastic  find he had come across.  Henry  offered the negatives to the library's  collection and Ron gratefully  accepted.  The box of plates rode  on Ron's lap the rest of the trip.  Once back in Vancouver it took Ron  several months of tedious and painstaking work to separate and clean  the delicate plates.  Although some  had been very badly damaged, most  had come through in good condition.  Mattie's photograt' s had been saved  for posterity.  Henry Gunterman passed away not long  thereafter.  Beaton was soon to die  as well.  A storage dam built by  B.C. Hydro on the Columbia River above  Castlegar flooded the Arrow Lakes all  the way up to Revelstoke.  Hydro put  more than a dozen communities to the  torch.  Many historical buildings  were bulldozed or burned.  Prime  agricultural land was lost to the  flood.  Beaton and the old ways of  life on the Arrow Lakes had been  destroyed forever.  We are indeed lucky Mattie's  photographs have survived.  This material on Mattie Gunterman  is from a book-in-progress by  Henri Robideau, and we are grateful to him for letting us use it.  From March 21 to April 8, 1978  the Vancouver Public Library held  an exhibition of Mattie Gunterman's  photographs, with Robideau*s prints  of those photographs. The exhibition  was a beautiful contribution to B.C.  herstory.  Jeanne Tetrault and Sherry Thomas,  COUNTRY WOMEN: A HANDBOOK FOR THE  NEW FARMER/ <New York: Anchor Books,  1976).  Encouraged by the success of Country  Women magazine, to which they both  contribute, Tetrault and Thomas have  compiled a comprehensive and readable  account of women returning to the  land, and of their struggles to learn  and grow.  This is, however, not just practical  information; there are poems, photographs, line drawings, and most  important, the journal of one of the  technical details of farm work.  Irresistably written, the journal  tempts one to read it through, skipping the stuff in between, and perhaps this is not such a bad thing.  We watch an individual grow in  strength and love for other women  in their work together and there is  real joy for the reader in the satisfaction gained by her growing  skills.  Basically, of course, the book is  intended as a textbook on country  living, covering all the contingencies of farm life.  For anyone  farming a small piece of land,  doing as much of the work involved  as is humanly possible, and caring '  deeply about the enterprise, this  is a valuable and noble book.  Jane Evans 18  ENGLAND  ENGLISH GAYS PROTEST HARASSMENT OF  OF PUBLICATION, GAY NEWS  Britain—5,000 lesbian and gay male  activists marched through London to  Trafalgar Square February 11 to protest the convictions for blasphemous  libel against Gay News♦ Gay News is  the world's largest circulation gay  publication. Mary Whitehouse, the  British version of Anita Bryant, took  Gay News to court for publishing a  poem which made sexual references to  Christ.  The demonstration received support  from many lesbian and gay organizations, from some trade union locals  and labour councils. A message of  support was received from Canada's  Body Politic.  WOMEN PROTEST SENSATIONAL ATTACKS  ON LESBIAN MOTHERS  Artificial Insemination by Donor  (AID) is nothing new.  It's been  available in France for 30 years,  for example. But recently the London paper, Evening News, published  a series of articles about lesbians  getting pregnant through AID. Those  articles were written in a sensational manner that stirred up anti-  lesbian backlash.  In protest against this vicious press  coverage, more than 50 women staged a  sit-in in the editorial offices of  Evening News on January 6. Spare Rib  reporter Barbara Charles comments:  "It's amazing the indignation that  lesbians loving children has aroused  - how about that anger being directed  to men who batter their wives?"  MEXICO  Mexico City, Mexico — Prostitutes in  Mexico City say they will form a  national union to protect themselves  against police extoration and harassment.  Vergara Perez, a spokeswomen  for the city's estimated 70,000  prostitutes, said that a petition  will be delivered to President Jose  Lopez Portillo outlining the problems  the women face with law enforcement  officers in that city.  Recently, prostitutes in Spain threatened to divulge the names of high  members of the Spanish government  .who frequented bordellos unless  police harassment stopped and working  conditions improved for prostitutes  in that country.  —reprinted from. Her Say  Moscow, USSR—An amazon warrior,  buried with her war horse, spears,  arrows and gold earrings was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists  recently. The remains of the  warrior, who lived in the 4th or  5th century B.C. were excavated  near the Moldavian village of  Balabany. The scientists were  working at a burial mound built  by the Scythians, a nomadic tribe  of ancient times who roamed the  areas north of the Black Sea.  (Big Mama Rag)  MALAYSIA  MALAYSIAN WOMEN FIGHT  CORPORATE DUMPING OF DEP0-PR0VERA  IN SOUTHEAST ASIA  LNS—Depo-provera, the highly suspect injectable contraceptive tightly  restricted in England and America,  has now surfaced in Malaysia. Alert  women in Pinang, alarmed by reports  in the British Guardian, spotted the  substance here late last year.  Now they believe they have evidence  that the Rockefeller-funded International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF) has donated 100,000 vials  of the possible carcinogen to the  National Family Planning Board (NFPB)  of Malaysia. The drug is produced  by Upjohn, the large drug corporation  which sold over $1 billion worth of  products in 1976, according to official figures.  Confronted with evidence that depo-  provera causes protracted bleeding  and extended infertility beyond the  period of its use, as well as possible cancer, the NFCB attempted to  mollify the Pinang women's group,  claiming that the drug actually  "cures cancer".  In fact, according to a January 24,  1978 statement by the U.S. Department of the Environment, Health,  Education and Welfare (DEHEW),  depo-provera's only use in relation  to cancer is as "adjunctive therapy  and palliative treatment of inoperable, recurrent, and metastatic  endometrial carcinoma" —in other  words, it slightly eases the suffering caused by cancer in terminal  cases.  Even more important issues are  raised by the DEHEW statement, however, since it flatly declares that  for the United States, "the drug  is not regarded as being safe and  effective for any other condition  of use".  In other words, depo-  provera is virtually banned in the  country that manufactures it. The  only exceptions from the ban are  those "unable or unwilling to practice birth control" — in effect,  women who are confined to mental  institutions and who have lost all  personal say in the matter.  But the IPPF is dumping vast quantities of depo-provera abroad, apparently on the theory that 'population increase in the Third World  fuels revolution. And, just as the  intra-uterine device (IUD) and the  "Pill" were first tried out on the  captive population of Puerto Rico,  so now depo-provera is being tested  on 500,000 Third World women.  Union Wage reports  AUSTRALIA  BANK WORKERS ORGANIZE  AUSTRALIA has a union for bankworkers - the Bank Offices Association.  The union puts pressure on by refusing to handle business cheques, and  the tactic appears very successful.  Australian bankworker Janey Stone  comments: "They will process pension  cheques or pay cheques. Most blue  collar workers get paid by cash  anyway. But they won't handle  business or individual cheques."  "This is a terrific tactic because  they put such pressure on the business community, and they never have  to use it for more than a few days  at a stretch."  Banks in US  In SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, the Seattle  First National Bank went to trial  March 21 before the National Labor  Relations Board for unfair labour  practices.  Seattle First is the 21st largest  banking corporation in the U.S.,  and Firstbank Independent Employees  Association (FIEA), with 3,000 members, is the largest union of bank-  workers in the U.S.  Eighty percent  of the members of the union are  women.  Last November, the Seattle First  unilaterally implemented its new  contract,, taking away benefits the  union had won in earlier years.  The National Labor Relations Board  ruled in favour of the union, and  ordered the bank to change its  practices to avoid trial. The bank  refused.  The first bank strike in the state  of MINNESOTA is now under way in  the small town of Willmar. Eight  women, members of the Willmar Bank  Employees Association struck last  December. The major issue is sex  discrimination.  The Bank Employees appealed to the  Willmar chapter of NOW for assistance. NOW found them an attorney  and organized the picket in front  of the bank, which has continued in  sub-zero weather.  Harassment  Strike Issue  The sex discrimination issue arose  last year. A man was hired as a  "management trainee", at a salary  almost double the pay of the women  who were doing the same work. When  the women were asked to train him,  a striker said, "that was the last  straw".  The strikers are receiving no benefits, so NOW is on a fund-raising  campaign. Louise Mack, co-president  of the Willmar NOW chapter says,  "When you put together feminists  and unionists you've got a pretty  powerful organization."

The Sisters of the Precious Blood  claimed in the suit that the corporation was using high-powered advertising to persuade women to abandon  breast-feeding and use its product  instead.  The nuns claimed Bristol-  Myers knew that poor women had  neither the money to afford the  formula nor the facilities to properly  sterilize it.  Filed in US District Court in 1977,  the suit charged the company with  making false and misleading statements to its stockholders about the  true nature of its marketing methods  abroad.  The Nestle's Company, meanwhile, in  response to a 7 month long boycott of  its products in America, has  announced it is sending a company  representative on a tour of the US  to explain that corporation's policies for marketing its baby formulas  in the third world.  Nestle's has  reportedly been selling its baby  formulas by sending out employees  dressed as nurses, who persuade  third-world mothers of newborn  children to use Nestle's formulas  instead of breast milk to feed  their children.  In a related matter, a plant partly  operated by Nestle's in Medellin,  Colombia, and a Nestle's plant at  Tongala, in Australia, were reported  recently found by health authorities  in those countries to be marketing  milk which was contaminated with  %OTT i&  Mr. David E.

The way you sell infant formula in  developing countries in unethical,  deceptive and deadly.  It promotes  Baby Bottle Disease, which has  caused thousands of babies to die.  Until you change your sales practices, I shall continue to boycott  and urge my friends to do the same.  Signed,      - March 8  Above:    International Women's Day in  Paris.     Three thousand women marched  through a central area of Paris  March 4th to celebrate International  Women's Day.    A big and lively contingent in the demonstration was  that of Latin American women.    Being  refugees from various repressive  regimes,  most of them were hiding  their faces with masks and scarves.  Their banner reads:   "Latin American  Women,  forward. "  In Italy,   50,000 women marched in  the streets of Rome,   defying a ban  on protests and marches in that city.  They were demanding legalized  abortion, public day care centres,  equal pay for equal work,  and legal  guarantees for the autonomy of women.  SOUTH  BANNED WOMAN AND FRIENDS SENTENCED  Blomfontein, South Africa —Black  activist Winnie Mandela and 4 white  South African women have been sentenced for violations of the "banning"  order on Mandela.  A Blomfontein  Court found Mandela guilty of  receiving an unauthorized visit and  having a conversation with 2 neighbours in which she discussed the  price of a chicken.  Under South  African law, a "banned" person may  not speak to more than one person at  a time, is under continuous house  arrest, and can receive only visitors  approved by the authorities.  Although Mandela could have gotten a  maximum of 15 years in prison, she  received 2 suspended six-month  sentences.  This probably reflects  the South African government's fear  of skill.as an organizer, even in  prisons, and the growing power of  black South Africans, who packed both  the "black" and the "white" sections  of the courtroom during the trial.  The 4 white South African women who  were arrested for visiting Mandela  have been sentenced to prison terms  for refusing to answer police questions about the visit.  Three of the  women were sentenced to one year in  prison for "obstructing the course  of justice."  The fourth, 72-year old  Helen Joseph, was sentenced to 4  months, in consideration of her heart  condition.  Joseph herself was once  "banned" for 5 years and has spent 9  years under house arrest for anti-  apartheid acts.  —info from various news sources  Big Mama Rag  BOLIVIA  SIX WOMEN FORCE GOVERNMENT TO BACK DOWN  Six wives of miners began a hunger  strike in Bolivia last December 28  to demand that a Christmas amnesty  be extended to their husbands and  342 other political exiles.  University students joined the  hunger strike.  The miner's union  called a one-day workstoppage.  Church groups declared their support.  Support grew to the extent that the  government either had to give in or  mount repression on scale similar to  that in neighbouring Argentina.  Bolivian President Banzar capitulated.

When the  lesbian mothers were awarded custody  by King County Superior Court in  1972, the children's fathers appealed  the decision.  The case has ended up  before the State Supreme Court which  has been considering the case for-a  year but has yet to make a decision.

B^g Majm Rag 20  MLA's Debate      &      McCarthy's Response  MARCH 8 Evaluated  cont.from p.15  The exceptions, of course, were the  articles in the Sun and Province  about the parade. One suggestion was  to forestall this kind of coverage  with a barrage of letters and press  releases, and get our publicity going earlier.  In addition, the men's group against  sexism which has emerged from Information Day, has prepared a letter and  a petition about the coverage in the  Sun (see col 3, p. 22 -ed.)  -  we were  urged to take copies and give the  group feedback on the contents of  the letter.  There were two particularly interesting refusals to endorse or participate in the IWD action.  Fed of Labour  Womens Refusal  The first came from the Women's Committee of the B.C.Federation of Labour, apparently because:  1. there was too much of an element  of protest in our plans;  2. some women from the Committee  at the B.C. Federation of Labour  were at the BCFW convention last November and felt that anti-union sentiments were expressed there.  The Women's Committee did, however,  endorse March 8 as International Women's Day. They also protested the  sexist nature of the media coverage  of the parade in the Sun.  Several people at the evaluation said  that we shouldn't just ignore the  Women's Committee's refusals - we  should both publicize it and pressure  them about it because it is important  for us to find a way to work together  with the labour movement.  Some doubted whether we could get  much response from the B.C.Fed of  Labour bureaucracy, and that rank-  and-file contact is much more important. These women pointed out that  we did, in fact, get endorsements  from several individual locals. One  comment: "Working with the B.C. Fed.  is like working with a whale on land.  Big Mr Brady  During the planning stages for IWD,  a man arrived at the beginning of one  organizing meeting, refused to identify himself, and said he was there  in response to our letter asking for  participation.  After checking that the letter did in  fact specific women's attendance at  organizing meetings, the group politely asked him to leave.  He stormed out, declaring that this  was "reverse discrimination", and that  he was the President of the B.C. Teachers' Federation, no less!  This important man's name is Pat  Brady. He revoked, the endorsement  for IWD which we had from the B.C.  Teachers' Federation.  turn to p.22,col 1  cont. from p.   14   Liberal Leader Gordon Gibson and  Norm Levi  (Vancouver Burrard NDP)  also raised the issue of VSW's  funding. May 's Kinesis will tell  all...  BARBARA WALLACE (Cowichan-Malahat,  NDP), KAREN SANFORD (Comox - NDP)  and BILL KING (Revelstoke - Slocan  - NDP) also spoke about women and  unemployment.  Here's some brief excerpts:  BARBARA WALLACE: "I suggest, Mr.  Speaker, that women's problems do  need some specific attention from  the government. This government is  committed to leaving things to private enterprise...1 suggest that governments have a much larger responsibility than simply that well-being.  "...The minister (of Human Resources)  has said openly that day care is simply baby-sitting service, proves that  this government does not recognize  that this need for day care is something that has been going on and on  for years...always it has always  been the women who have been forced  back into the kitchen and told that  they did not have a right to freedom  of choice."  Next month: Details of the Socred mentality about "secondary wage earners"  - women,  that is.  Or,  how to make one  wage do for two...  KAREN SANDFORD: "We've had some publicity about attempts to organize  workers in the banks. The working conditions that those women have to put  .up with should not be allowed in this  day and age in this province or this  country. They are underpaid, overworked, very often have overtime without recognition, and accept all kinds  of additional responsibilities without  any sort of recognition from the employer. . .  "When economic times are difficult,  it becomes increasingly difficult for  them to organize...when jobs are scarce  and when we have a government that's  not prepared to do anything...people  cling to their jobs. They are worried  that if they even mention the word  "union" in a non-union place, they  will lose their jcbs..."  BILL KING: "I would expect from the  government a response that...is rational in terms of outlining what their  problems are in failing to come up  with programmes that recognize the  social and economic plight of women  in the workforce in British Columbia  today..."  GRACE MCCARTHY (Provincial Secretary)  responded:  "...You will recall through the press  recently that there has been a great  deal of concern expressed by the Status of Women. In fact, they picketed  my office on Fraser Ave., Mr Speaker,  because they were not pleased with  the amount of money...  "...this government has recognized  the fact that there is a place in  this province for women to have some  kind of status and pay tribute to the:  fact that they need assistance in  that regard...I want to make it clear  to the House that this is the only  organization that is fully funded by  this Ministry...  "In my conversations with and from  my letters to the Vancouver Status of  Women in the past I have said to them  ...that in order for any organization  to be viable and to warrant support  certainly of this provincial government, they have to have community support in depth, in fact, and in reality.  Last year that was given to the Status of Women very clearly and apparently, according to their brief before  the cabinet in Saanich approximately  three or four weeks ago, they were  not able to get the required assistance from the community. So, Mr.Speak  er, they were given their grant once  again and they refused to accept it  in that they said it wasn't sufficient. Yet it was not cutting down  their grant, in spite of the warning  that they had that they should get  some support from the community to  prove their worth within the community. I hope this closes the matter  in respect to whether or not they  have been cut down in any way...  EILEEN DAILLY commented on McCarthy's  response:  "If anyone in that government should  be giving leadership to the women of  this province, that is the minister  who should be doing it. She has the  power. She has the power of the grants  She is a woman herself. She should  understand the problems that women  face. But instead we find that this  minister shows a complete ignorance  of the struggles of women in this  province today. She shows a complete  ignorance of a very fine organization,  the Status of Women organization of  Vancouver.  "The statements that she made tonight  regarding that organization I consider were insulting to the group.  They're based on complete ignorance,  or else that minister is playing  straight politics with the House...  turn to col 3, p.23 21  ANTI NUCLEAR RESISTANCE  On May 22nd, there will be a mass  action of nuclear resistance at Bangor  Washington, site of the Trident Submarine Base.  On May 23rd, the United Nations will  meet for a special session to consider  nuclear disarmament.  Throughout North America, coalitions  for nuclear resistance will be pressuring for the U.N. to support disarmament .  One of the local women's groups which  has consistently opposed the construction of Trident, and which is now  involved in the Ad Hoc Coalition of  Disarmament is the VOICE OF WOMEN.  The Ad Hoc Coalition for Disarmament  is located at 1811 West 16th Avenue,  Vancouver, B. C.  They have materials  available concerning the upcoming  Special Session on Disarmament  VOICE OF WOMEN  In recognition of the major anti-  nuclear mobilizations coming up this  summer, and of the part played in  nuclear resistance by the VOICE OF  WOMEN, Kinesis asked the group to  give us a brief outline of their  group's history and current work:  The Voice of Women, a national organization whose objective is to bring  about World Peace, to realize a "world  without war", was founded in 1960 with  branches in every province and its  national office in Toronto.  In the 1950's many women were still  stunned by the incredible devastation  of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings  which happened in August 1945.  Canadian mothers were concerned about  the atomic testing that was being carried out on this continent with the  resulting residues of Strontium 90  which was found to exist in the crops  and consequently in the milk.  It was inevitable that the women so  concerned would come together and form  an organization within which they  could express their fears and take  some positive action.  So it was in July 1960 that the Voice  of Women was formed, the founding members travelled across Canada and soon  gathered other interested women into  action.  The first step was the preparation of a brief on disarmament,  which, on behalf of all the branches,  was presented and discussed with Canadian parliamentary leaders.  DISARMAMENT  Over the years, every possible means  has been utilized by the organization  to press for its objective; briefs and  fact sheets were prepared and distributed, letter writing sessions were  held, films and slide shows were prepared and delegations have interviewed  prime ministers, cabinet ministers and  members of parliament and legislatures.  This has been done consistently over the years.  This type of  approach was also extended to prime  ministers and presidents of other  countries asking for their commitments  in achieving World Disarmament.  Many conferences and workshops were  organized at the national and local  levels to discuss issues and formulate  policy for future action.  At other times representatives of the  Voice of Women attended numerous  internaional meetings including those  of the United Nations.  Over the years there was a consistent  effort to have China, then, an emerging power, invited to become a member  of the United Nations. This was finally realized.  VIETNAM WAR  The Vietnam War was a source of concern to members and many helped to  raise large sums of money for relief  of the injured victims and committees  were formed to collect clothing and  knitted garments, particularly for  Vietnamese children.  In recent years the Voice of Women  became concerned about environmental  problems, especially those which resulted from the build-up of waste  materials from nuclear reactors and  other low level radiation. Again,  there has been a prolific publication  of booklets, fact sheets and slide  shows and the information has been  circulated to the public, so that many  more people have now become aware of  the situation.  A number of our members in eastern  Canada were involved in the formation  and success of the Status of Women.  At this point, one has to look back  over the years and realize in spite of  our efforts for world peace, the proliferation of nuclear weapons has  developed beyond belief and now we  have the "neutron bomb", a deadly  thing.  This sophisticated, costly and  widespread technology must be the  greatest threat to civilization that  has ever been known.  Because, it is  felt by this organization and others  who agree with us that we now face the  final choice between extermination or  the survival of Life on Earth, we have  assisted in forming an Ad Hoc Coalition in British Columbia in preparation for the forthcoming Special Sessions on Disarmament to be held at the  United Nations.  These meetings will  take place in May and June of this  year and we hope that sufficient  public interest will be a factor in  forcing these sessions to declare that  a World Disarmament Conference will be  held as soon as possible.  FEMINIST  PERSPECTIVE  In AUSTRALIA, feminists are organizing  against nuclear development.  Women  Against Nuclear Energy (WANE) was  founded June 1977.  WANE is concerned with bringing technical knowledge of the nuclear issue  in non-sexist, political terms.  They point out that much anti-nuclear  literature is written to appeal to  women as mothers, alarmed about the  future of their children.  WANE aims to break down this sexist  assumption that women should oppose  nuclear energy because the fate of  future generations is in their hands.  In the U.S., feminist involvement in  anti-nuclear resistance has included  the KAREN SILKWOOD issue.  Three and a half years ago, Karen  Silkwood, an elected representative  of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic  Workers International Union was killed  in a mysterious car crash.  She was en route to a meeting with a  New York Times reporter and a national  union official to deliver evidence to  quality control violations at the  Kerr-McGee plutonium fuel fabrication  plant where whe worked.  The documents  she carried were never recovered, and  a private investigator found evidence  of foul play.  NOW Labour Task Force members have  been among those trying to re-open the  Silkwood case. sa  cont. from p.20  A couple of people at the evaluation felt we should draw attention  to this fact.  TOO LITTLC  TOO LATG  There were several criticisms of  our publicity before the events,  especially our efforts to draw more  women into the organizing procress.  It was generally a case of too little,  too late. We should start earlier and  emphasize this area more, especially  if we want to get other groups, such  as unions, involved.  The process of the organizing committee came in for a good deal of comment, both favourable and unfavourable.  Some mentioned that our decision-making process was very democratic and  that other groups are using it as a  model. (It seems obvious in retrospect,  but it took a while to get it together:  open to all women; votes; one woman,  one vote; 2/3 majority required; subcommittees to do the work but to be  accountable to the large committee  which makes major policy decisions;  quorum needed for decisions, including  someone from at least 2/3 of the subcommittees .)  Some felt that we voted too much,  and especially that we tended to use  voting as a rubber-stamping for non-  contentious issues.  Others felt that the problem was more  the avoidance of contentious issues  until the last minute when everyone  felt hassled about them. Several women did say that often meetings were  negative and unproductive : on some  issues we made decisions, then wasted  time arguing all over again, and finally, re-made the same decision!  Initially we also tried to exercise  far too much control over the subcommittees. This was partly an over-  reaction to the WAR experience. It  merely used up our time and stopped  the work from getting done. Eventually, we did put more trust in the  delegated sub-committees.  Some felt that women had left the  group because the process was frustrating. One comment was that we  could have done more using l/10th  of the energy, because the experience  was so draining. A problem felt by  everyone was how few of us there  were. Subcommittees were small, and  a few women were incredibly overworked .  However, for a group of women with  differing political viewpoints, who  had never worked together before,  perhaps these problems couldn't have  been avoided entirely.  We took on a lot for this year's IWD.  It all came off spectacularly well.  As organizers, we must have mobilized  the right people - they made it happen!  As a movement, we're obviously alive  and kicking.  Many women pointed out that this  year's success gives us greater credibility and will make future organizing easier.  NORTH SHORC  CREDIT UNION  re:       FIRED FOR EXPOSING SEXISM  - Feb. issue.  I was very interested to read the  article on Judith Burke who was fired  by North Shore Community Credit Union  for her comments on sexism on the job.  The article drew my attention because  I too am a woman involved in credit  unions (as co-chairperson, CCEC Credit  Union) and I took part in an interview for the issue of "Enterprise"  in which Judith Burke's article  appeared.  When I read her article, I was struck  by her honesty and clarity, and I was  pleased that many credit union  officers would have the opportunity  to read what she had to say.  And I  am very distressed to hear that she  was fired for saying it.  I disagree with her, however, that  women should not withdraw their money  from North Shore Credit Union in  protest.  Your money (savings) can be a powerful tool.  If every person who is  concerned over this firing withdrew  her/his savings from the credit union  (AND MADE THE REASONS FOR THIS WITHDRAWAL KNOWN TO THE MANAGER!) the  credit union would take note.  If  the members leave the minimum share  deposit in the credit union, they  will still retain their rights as  members and can continue to work for  change from within.  This kind of repression should not  be tolerated in a co-operative organization.  Jill Kelly  2615 Windsor Street  Vancouver, B. C.  The float that caused the furore when  the Sun reporter mistook it for an  entry from the B.C.Fed of Labour.  STOCKAND  This is the letter which the men 's  group against sexism (which developed at Information Day, March 5)  is circulating.  It has the support  of VSW.  Copy it, or write a variant version, and send it to the  Vancouver Sun.  Stuart Keate, Publisher  Vancouver Sun  2250 Granville Street  Vancouver, B. C.  Mr. Keate:  I protest the coverage your newspaper, the Vancouver Sun, gave  to the International Women's Day  parade as the most outrageous  example yet of your newspaper's  ongoing bias against women and  their supporters.  The article written by Dave Stockand  titled vStrange parade ends in chat-  in' (Mar. 9, p. B-l) and passed for  publication by your editors is  extremely contemptuous of all women,  whatever their activities and  beliefs.  In quoting passers-by and spectators  Mr. Stockand ignored all but the  most negative and sarcastic reactions  to the parade.  He was inaccurate  in that he was unable to distinguish between the British Columbia  Federation of Labour, which was not  officially present, and the British  Columbia Federation of Women, which  was.  There was his derogatory use  of the term "gal" to refer to an  adult woman.  Finally, there was his  incredible and malicious remark that  "...gossiping... as we all know, is  something that womanfolk are prone  to do when left with idle time on  their hands."  Mr. Stockand's entire  coverage of this event was  obviously slanted to ridicule as much  as possible both participants and  their aim.  By giving this article the editorial  sanction necessary for its publication, you demonstrate that you,  your editors, and your reporter  misunderstand the scope and impact  of the women's movement.  The only  other possibility is that you do  understand, yet are opposed to, the  liberation of women.  Certainly,  coverage of women's issues and  actions which is pervaded by such  cynical sarcasm as that present  in Mr. Stockand's article, is far  too representative of your newspaper's editorial practice; even-  handed coverage such as Der Hoi-  Yin 's reporting of the IWD  Information Workshops is the rare  and welcome exception.  As an individual, I feel insulted by  the degrading attitudes shown in  this article, and I demand a complete retraction and apology to be  printed on the same page and in the  same range of editions as the  offending article.  Also, I demand  that, as publisher of a major newspaper in Canada's third-largest  city, you show a higher level of  journalistic and editorial integrity  regarding women's issues than that  presented in Mr. Stockand's inexcusable article.

AN EDITOR'S NIGHTMARE  In the last issue of Kinesis, a letter  on p.20, col 3, Reply to CALFAA lost  its signature on its journey through  production.  The letter was written, and signed,  by Joan Woodward.  EILEEN DAILLY RESPONDS TO GRACE  concluded from p.20  "Mr Speaker, when the hon. Provincial Secretary referred to the fact  that the Status of Women were unable  to get their money because they had  been originally financed , I believe,  by the federal government, or even  had trouble receiving any money from  them, I don't think she's even read  their brief, which outlines page by  page the history of the Status of Women in Vancouver. And there is the  minister making erroneous statements  about a group and then making arbitary  decisions based on complete misinformation, or lack of understanding...  "She bases her non-agreement with  them on the fact that they haven't  gone out into the community and raised  equivalent monies. Mr.Speaker, this  shows that the Provincial Secretary  isn't aware of the economic situation  in this province created by her own  government. This is a very difficult  time for any group to try to go out &  voluntarily, gain money from other  groups in this province who are struggling to get by themselves.  And she can sit there blithely, and  talk about going to the community,  and because they haven't gone to■the  community, she uses that excuse. I  think it was a shameful defence of  her non-agreement and her lack of  understanding...of the needs of the  women of this province."
