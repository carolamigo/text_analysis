Latin  America news  The fifth Canadian conference in solidarity with Latin American women will be  held from February 27 to March 1 at Vancouver's Native Education Centre, 285 E.  5th. Themes for this year's conference  will be the effects of immigration on Latin  American women, native women, human  rights in Latin America, the economic crisis in Latin America, and women and the  peace movement. Organizers are working  ha,rd to ensure that conference participants from Latin America and the United  States, as well as Canada, will be able to  attend.  Fees for the conference are $30 for  employed. $20 for unemployed, for the  full three days, plus a nominal amount  for food. Women are encouraged to seek  sponsorship from groups and organizations. Unfortunately there are no travel  funds available. Organizers can provide  billeting for conference participants from  outside the lower mainland. Childcare will  also be provided and the conference site  is wheelchair accessible. Translation will  be available for Spanish, French and English. As well as workshops, the weekend  will feature cultural events including music, films and art exhibits.  To raise funds the conference committee is selling commemorative posters and  post cards based on an original drawing  by Argentinian artist. Nora Patrich.  For further information, particularly on  subsidies for conference delegates, or to  get involved in conference organizing call  872-5305.  Sisterhood  still powerful  Organizing for 1987's International  Women's Day celebrations is continuing. Presently there are only four women  working on the committee and clearly a  successful IWD will require more organizers.  The suggested theme for this year's  IWD is "Sisterhood Is Still Powerful"..  Activities planned at this time call for a  parade and rally with, for the first time,  floats, if insurance coverage can be arranged. Organizers are also investigating fundraising which will enable them  to place an IWD ad in the Vancouver  Sun thereby reaching women who might  not otherwise be aware of IWD. Information about upcoming IWD meetings can  be obtained by calling 324-5467 or 872-  5847.  New NFB  women's unit  The French Program Branch of the  National Film Board has established a  women's production unit with a mandate  to increase the presence and influence  of women in all areas of documentary  filmmaking within the French Program  Branch. The French Program Women's  Unit will strive to provoke discussion and  change in the social, cultural, economic  and political relationships between men  and women, and focus on new ways of  examining human relationships.  One of the Unit's objectives is to establish a talent bank of women from  all sectors of the film industry including  actresses, narrators, scriptwriters, composers, musicians and graphic artists.  The Women's Unit also hopes to organize workshops and short term professional development courses. Two films  are slated to be made during the winter  of 1987, and several other projects will  be researched and evaluated for production next year.  For more information or to register  with the French Program's Women's Unit  talent bank contact Jose'e Beaudet, the  Unit's producer, at the National Film  Board of Canada P-39. P.O. Box 6100.

Volunteer  ESL tutors  The Canadian Farmworkers Union  (CFU) is currently organizing its fifth  English as a Second Language Crusade  for farmworkers in the Vancouver area.  The Union is looking for volunteer tutors, experience preferred but not necessary. Training will be* provided in the  methods of Paulo Freire, Nina Waller-  stein and others. Workshops will focus  on literacy techniques, farmworker's issues, the Punjabi community and its language. Contact with a network of other  tutors and ongoing support are provided.  Learning to communicate in English  means farmworkers, many of whom are  women, are better equipped to determine  and demand their rights as farmworkers. Learning English is a crucial step in  breaking the dependency on labour contractors who often exploit people working as farmworkers. English is also a vital skill since the unmonitored use of pesticides makes farmwork the third most  hazardous occupation in North America  Training for tutors will take place in  early December and ESL classes will run  from January to April. For information  on how to become a tutor in the Farmworkers ESL Crusade contact 430-6055  or Cheryl Howrigan. 879-9749.  Women's  Studies  Vancouver Community College.

Or so the  boys in their union might conclude.  The women, office cleaners for  Cominco industries in Trail, British  Columbia, were laid off last March,  and learned that their part time  cleaning shifts which employed  fourteen women were to be changed  to full time 'janitorial' shifts employing eight men. They attempted to grieve the lay-offs with  their union claiming sex discrimination and violation of the collective agreement. The union,  United Steelworkers of America,  Local 480, rejected the women's  grievance saying the company was  within its rights.  The women, most of whom are  widows of Cominco workers, have  an average age of fifty-three and  have worked for the company up to  fifteen years. They have been full  dues paying union members since  1974. Their job loss will mean surviving on a $122 monthly widow's  pension.  4^shjey're angry—and are letting their union brothers know it.  They've filed a Section 7 complaint with the British Columbia  Labour Relations Board charging  Local 480 with acting in bad faith  and in a discriminatory manner.  "We feel the union has a moral  obligation to us," said Charleen  Davidow, a cleaner with seven  years seniority. She explained that  the collective agreement includes  an addendum which clearly defines  office cleaners as a separate entity for purposes of seniority, and  means they cannot be bumped out  of their jobs by other laid off Cominco workers. This being so, their  jobs were instead "reassigned" to  janitors—an entirely new classification. Eight men were therefore  recalled from lay-off on a full time  permanent basis, and the fourteen  women replaced them in the unemployment line.  Furthermore, the men are wage-  protected; they are paid at their  previous wage grade. They now  earn a minimum of $4 an hour  more as janitors than the women  earned as cleaners doing the same  work (office cleaners are paid at the  lowest union wage grade).  "We are not saying we have a  divine right to work," said Anne  Duperon, another cleaner. "We  realize times are tough.and many  are unemployed ... but as dues-  paying members we should have  been approached (by our union) at  the outset if our jobs were in jeopardy."  The women are fighting what  appears to be a losing battle, and  being fourteen women among several hundred job-hungry men is  only a part of it. They must  also contend with Cominco management who, it is rumoured, will  do away with part time workers  (almost entirely women) altogether  during the next set of negotiations.  They must also fight at the Labour  Relations Board level, where Section 7 complaints are rarely won.  And of course the legal expenses  are difficult to pay on widow's pensions.  Kinesis contacted Local 480 for  comment on the lay-offs and Section 7 complaint. Ken Georgetti,  union president, denied all com-  Please see TV-ail, page 8.  Vernon  Hospital aborts committee  by Sharon Hounsell  Vernon is the latest in a growing number of Canadian communities virtually cut off from safe access to abortions.  In late October, the Vernon Jubilee Hospital Society Board imposed regulations on it's therapeutic abortion committee that will  not only make it more difficult for  a woman to prove pregnancy would  endanger her physical or mental  health, but also requires her to  sign a consent form which cites  the abortion law, describes fetal  development, lists possible complications and provides a number  of anti-choice agencies should she  "decide" to continue with her pregnancy.  The "helping agencies" listed  on the form are Problem Preg  nancy, the Salvation Army, church  groups, the Ministry of Human  Resources and Burden Bearers—  an anti-choice private adoption  agency in Vancouver. The consent form also makes notes on fetal development up to fourteen  weeks and quotes Section 251 of  the Criminal Code. The form must  be signed after each of its four sections before application is make to  the hospital's therapeutic abortion  committee.  Vernon's doctors have responded to the Board's new policy with  a fifty-two to five vote of non-  confidence but the vote is of no legal consequence. Dr. Jane Forsey,  president of the hospital's medical society, said the only real resource is for more people to join  the hospital society which administers the hospital and elects the  Board. Anyone, other than hospital staff, can join the society.  Canadians establish Dalkon Shield Action group  by Marrianne van Loon  As the case against A.H. Robins  and the Dalkon Shield drags on in  the United States court, Canadian  women have established Dalkon  Shield Action Canada (DSAC)  to protect their interests. Maggie Thompson of DSAC said, "It's  clear the Americans aren't going  to look after our interests."  Canadian women were not given  the same notice to file claims  against Robins as American  women. In the United States 12.9  percent of Shield users have filed  claims, in Canada only 4.4 percent. "These figures make a really  strong case for having a national  organization to make sure Canadians get a fair deal", said Thompson.  DSAC has three major goals for  the next six months. They intend  to provide information and support to Dalkon Shield users and  claimants against A.H. Robins. As  well, they are developing a national registry of lawyers who have  worked on the Dalkon case.  You can contact Dalkon  Shield Action Canada at the  Vancouver     Women's    Health  Collective, 888 Burrard St.  Vancouver, B.C. Phone 682  4805.  Thompson said many Canadian  women do not have legal representation for their claims, and lawyers  have been soliciting these women  to invite them to become clients.  "We think there's a real problem  with lawyers going shopping like  that. Women have no way to assess their competence, and this  could mean they become doubly  exploited; first by Robins and secondly by lawyers making money  from legal fees."  A further goal of the DSAC  is to establish a team of lawyers,  to represent women as a group.  "If women join together in group  court action we think they will be  much better represented than if  they go individually."  Thompson also said that it may  not be too late for women to file  claims, even though the April 30  deadline is long past. They are currently working to have more recent claims accepted. "We encourage women who still haven't filed  to contact us, as it's possible that Maggie Thompson, spokesperson for Dalkon Shield Action  claims may still be accepted by the Canada, urges "group court action" for women making Dalkon  court."« shield claims. _____  Like many hospitals elsewhere in  Canada, Board elections have become an annual battle ground for  pro and anti choice groups. Forsey  explained that at last September'  annual meeting, a member moved  that board elections be made civic  rather than private. The motion  was voted down by the anti-choice  members. This year there were no  pro-choice candidates in the hospital election.  The hospital board also has the  authority to appoint five doctors  to its abortion committee. The  doctors recommended five nominees but only two of their candidates were chosen. The other three  appointees—the board's choices-  have been vocally anti-choice. The  two doctors recommended by the  medical society resigned from the  committee when the board announced its new regulations.  The Vernon hospital's new procedures will mean delays which increase the risk of complications  substantially. It's ironic that the  hospital board lists the complications on a consent form to 'inform' the patient, yet restricts access to abortion in such a way as  to make those complications more  likely. When this was pointed out  to Jake Sporr, chairman of the  hospital's board, he said, "Hopefully the woman would carry to  term and have her baby." He cited  a study of 6,400 women in eastern Canada, eighty-seven percent  of whom "chose" to have babies  when they were denied access to  abortion.  Nora Hutchinson, spokesperson for the Concerned Citizens  for Choice on Abortion (CCCA)  called this "forced pregnancy".  "What you have to look at are  the problems that arise out of  forced pregnancy," said Hutchinson. "What happens to the  woman? To the child?"  Jan Schumaker, Okanagan  Women's Coalition said, "Our  hands are tied".  According to Schumaker the  coalition has been advised by the  Please see Vernon, page 8.  h\l N E SJ,$ fiec/ Jan ffl» 4$i$>f35 Vander Zalm endorses trade with apartheid  by Nancy Pollak  After twenty five minutes of  talks with South African Ambassador Glenn Babb early in November, Premier William Vander Zalm  told reporters that Babb said  apartheid was no longer a policy of the South African government. The premier also declared  his interest in expanding economic  ties with the Pretoria regime, citing the export of prefabricated  wooden houses as a new business  opportunity for the people of British Columbia.  Vander Zalm's ignorance of  South African government policy  dovetails nicely with his perception of the housing needs of that  country's black majority. According to a spokesperson from Oxfam  Canada, wooden housing is unusable throughout most of the country due to the climate, and the  expense of imported prefab units  would be prohibitive to the black  population.  The South African government's record on black housing  has been one of forced removals  and the bulldozing of established  communities. At present, the 4,000  residents of Lawaaikamp outside  George, the hometown of President P.W. Botha, are resisting  a government-sponsored 'resettlement' to an area out of sight of the  town. Their efforts are hampered  by the state of emergency imposed  last June which has increased the  government's police state powers.  Meanwhile, Pretoria claims that,  since such forced resettlements are  no longer official policy, they are  no longer occurring.  According to Oxfam, the only  conceivable use for prefab homes  would be as emergency housing for  scabs in the event of the mass firings of unionized workers, a not  uncommon occurrence in South  Africa.  The Vander Zalm and Babb  meeting was roundly condemned  by Southern Africa support  groups, the provincial opposition  and the Minister for External Affairs Joe Clark. Clark seemed dismayed by the premier's eagerness  to do business with the South  Africans, remarking that while  "He (Vander Zalmfis naturally,  in a democracy, entitled to his  view and I respect him for expressing it ... I disagree with his  view." Clark suggested that Vander Zalm's actions undermined the  spirit of voluntary, limited sanctions, a key ingredient in the Conservatives' strategy towards apartheid. "I hope we are not driven...  to mandatory actions," Clark said.  Mandatory and complete sanctions are exactly what the black  people of South Africa have  been calling for since 1961, said  a spokesperson from the South  African Congress of TVade Unions  (SACTU), and Vander Zalm's  actions testify to the weakness  and inadequacy of existing federal  measures.  In July 1985, Ottawa imposed  limited sanctions on arms and  technology trade between South  Africa and Canada. Since that  time, overall imports from South  Africa have risen by fifty percent  (to a total of $358.3 million in a  thirteen monthperiod), a sign, according to SACTU, that the July  sanctions may merely have encouraged Canadian businesses to  stockpile South African products.  Ottawa's reluctance to use economic leverage to pressure Pretoria is reflected in the latest round  of sanctions introduced this October. An import ban has been applied to South African agricultural  goods, uranium, steel and coal  products. However, the uranium  trade had been paltry, Canadian  steel and coal producers welcomed  the elimination of a competitor,  and Canada's powerful steel lobby  persuaded Ottawa to exempt certain steel making alloys from the  ban.  British Columbia's contribution  to the South African economy is  concentrated in imports of mineral  and food products, and exports  of wood pulp and sulphur (via,  among others, Petro Canada). The  port of Vancouver is the point of  transfer for forty-eight percent of  Canadian exports to South Africa.  Glenn Babb's courtesy call to  Vander Zalm—and the friendly  reception it yielded—are exactly  what Pretoria is banking on  in the face of increasing pressures at home and abroad. The  South African Bureau of Infor-  Boring in on economics  by Kinesis Staff Writer  New Westminster's Douglas  College was the setting in late  November for a conference on  women and the economy whose  goal was to explore economic issues and develop strategies around  changing the economic conditions  that affect women's lives.  The conference, which was held  in conjunction with a National Action Committee on the Status of  Women regional meeting, was attended by over 150 women from all  over the province.  Strategy panels and workshop  sessions during the conference started with an innovative and successful small group session entitled  "Jumping Into Economics", which  included time for individuals to assess their own individual economic  goals as well as the larger economic  conditions that stand in the way of  achieving those goals. (Small picture economics versus large picture  economics). The workshop, which  received high marks in participant's post conference evaluation  remarks was an effort to demystify  economic issues and women's roles  in them.  The first panel of the day,  chaired by Jean Swanson of End  Legislated Poverty (ELP), featured speakers from the Women's  Research Centre, Women's Skills  and the Women's Economic Agenda. Panelists focussed on outlining  recent work and analysis of British  Columbian women on economic is-  Issue workshops interspersed  throughout the conference included: "Women in Resource-based  Towns", "Government Economic  Policies: Their Impact on Women", "Women in the Waged Labour  Force", "Immigrant Women", "Native Women", and "The Economics  of Housework". By far the most  popular sessions were those which  focused on community economic  development, the focus of an afternoon strategy panel.  Melanie Conn's presentation on  feminist community economy development focused on distinguishing between economic development  which deals with "individual so^'  lutions, such as self employment  and job readiness, and those which  promote broader community and  group solutions."  mation has widely publicized the  fact that British Columbia continues to sell their wine, and  that the provincial government opposes sanctions. As Louie Ettling  from Vancouver's South African  Women Against Apartheid said,  "The South African government is  using Vander Zalm to say, 'Look,  the world is still trading with us.'  It doesn't matter what it is—the  South African government would  be happy to trade dust."*  South African Women Against Apartheid (SAWAA) is co-  sponsoring a coffee house December 12. Please see Bulletin  Board for details.  Regionalizing NAC  According to Conn, a feminist  perspective means "looking at the  impact of community development  on women, as individuals and as a  group, and secondly on the level of  participation of women in the planning of economic activity."  Conn said that what she deems  as conventional development often  doesn't take into account women's  needs or situations. One example she used was how developing  tourism projects means providing  hospitality jobs that pay poorly  and offer little training or hope for  future employment.  Good community economic development will, she said, involve  more women, generate wealth and  jobs within a community and lastly  develop economic planning that  will be more socially responsible.  Conn's presentation concluded  by urging conference participants  to consider carefully the impact of  new enterprises on the individual,  the household and the community,  a process she called social accounting as distinguished from commercial accounting —where the bottom line is always the maximization of profits.  by Kinesis Staff Writer  Fifty British Columbia women  gathered in Vancouver in late  November to grapple with the enduring problems of regional representation and structure in the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC). NAC,  Canada's only national feminist  political action group has long  been prey to criticisms from the  west, and other regions, that it is  too heavily dominated by Ontario-  based women's organizations. This  criticism was particularly severe  when reduced travel subsidies prevented many British Columbia  women's groups from attending  NAC's annual meeting and lobby  held in Ottawa last May.  At the meeting, attended by  NAG President Louise Dulude and  other executive members, delegates put forward a host of recommendations aimed at rectifying  regional representation and structural problems.  A key issue for all the delegates  was that the cost of delegate travel  should be spread among all the  women's groups attending NAC's  annual general meeting. Other  proposals discussed included suggestions that NAC's regional representatives be provided with special funds for travel and telephone  costs and that NAC's annual meeting should be moved from Ottawa to accommodate more concentrated lobbying in the regions.  A number of ideas bearing on  NAC's structure were also discussed including that committee  chairs should be elected instead of  appointed and that the executive  members at large category should  be abolished and replaced with the  committee chairs.  Members of NAC's newly formed Organizational Review Committee have pledged to study all  the recommendations with a view  to including them in NAC's restructuring process, due tb! be  completed in two years. If, however, British Columbian women  want more immediate action on  these issues they should raise them  at the next NAC annual general  meeting.  Jane Evans, British Columbia's  representative on the NAC, executive, found the meeting "extremely useful". "The NAC executive", said Evans, "sometimes feels  that it is operating in a vacuum  on issues around structure and today we have found that women  have thought intensely about these  issues. Many, many good suggestions have come up here and I'm  sure that many will be implemented."!  ■ **¥&  I  Another workshop of particular interest was the "Economics of  Housework", led by Ellen Wordsworth which focused on how the  unpaid labour of women in the  home determines the roles, status, jobs and wages of all women.  Wordsworth presented the workshop participants with a copy of  It's Time Housework Was Recognized and Paid, the final report of the Housewives in Research  and Training project. The report is a fascinating study, based  on survey findings, of 2,000 Vancouver homes, of the work that  women do in the home and how  they view their contributions to  the community. The report concludes with a number of rec  mendations including that house-  workers be paid a wage and a pension, that housework be included  in the gross national product and  that housework and domestic work  be covered under provincial labour  standards laws. ■  Copies of It's Time Housework Was Recognized and Paid  are available from Housewives  in Training and Research, 4982  Victoria Drive, Vancouver,  B.C.

The Criminal Code Section 195.1 states that it is illegal to "communicate or attempt to  communicate" the buying or selling of sex. How can it be criminal to talk about something that  in itself is not a crime?" asks Bir-  git Eder, a Vancouver lawyer who  works closely with Prostitutes and  Other Women for Equal Rights  (POWER). She has been fighting  C-49, the anti-soliciting act, since  its inception last December, on the  grounds that it violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Eder is currently working on  one of two cases being appealed  by the Crown before the British  Columbia Court of Appeal. "It's  only one in a long series of steps  that will end up in the Supreme  Court of Canada. Similar cases  are being tried in several other  provinces. The Court will probably hear them all together. But the  final outcome won't be known for  at least two years."  Meanwhile, British Columbia's  Attorney General is spending a  lot of time and money harassing  prostitutes. Eder feels die province  should be using its resources to  pursue more serious offenders.  Sentencing  midwives  by Maura Volante  Marie Arrington, spokesperson  for POWER, concurs. "The treatment accorded prostitutes far exceeds the norm for summary (i.e.  minor) offenses.  "Hardest hit are women with  children. After the third arrest police will hold women, without bail,  for up to two weeks until their  trial date. One woman said she  had been held ten days—only to  have her charges dropped."  "Also," Arrington added, "the  courts, under direction from Brian  Smith (Attorney General) are imposing strict area restrictions and  curfews. In one case, a woman was  ordered not to enter the area bordered by Cambie and Broadway,  16th and 2nd (or Great Northern  Way). When told that she lived in  that area, the judge responded by  adding a 7 am to 7 pm curfew."  "It used to be that vice squad  patrolled the streets at night only.  ' But since Expo closed, vice is out  during the day, too. There are far  more male undercovers than female. As a result, more prostitutes  are being arrested than tricks."  "The police say it's normal that  there are more men than women  for undercover work. But I don't  buy it," Arrington said.

BC moratorium on  Uranium ends Feh.  by Marrianne van Loon  Will British Columbia continue  to keep its uranium in the ground?  The seven year moratorium on  uranium mining and exploration  ends on February 27, and no one  knows for sure what will happen  next.  The Socred cabinet initiated the  moratorium during an ongoing inquiry into developing a uranium  industry in the province. At the  time there was great public outcry  against mining uranium.  Uranium is found in the Okanagan valley, near Clearwater, Beav-  erdale, Kamloops and south to the  United States border. Most of this  land is prime Socred territory.  The Vancouver Green Women's  Caucus has been organizing as a  network to educate the public and  act as a contact for the Okanagan area. Adrian Carr, spokesperson for the Caucus, said: "If nothing is done to extend the moratorium it simply ends. We'll see a re-  introduction of uranium mining in  the province."  In 1980 the Bennett government  hoped new technologies would be  discovered to take care of the immense problems associated with  uranium mining: radioactive contamination and waste disposal.  The dangers of radioactivity from  mining still exist, and will for  another half a million years—the  time it takes for the radioactive  materials to decay into harmless  compounds.

"It would contaminate  the watersheds.in the Okanagan,  and both agriculture and tourism  would suffer." Workers are exposed to increased radiation levels, and are at high risk from diseases such as lung cancer. Uranium must also be transported,  and leaks and accidents can occur.'  "Not only are there environmental and health risks to British  Columbians, but there is the potential for further development of  the nuclear industry, and of contributing to the nuclear industry  elsewhere," said Carr. "I find that  morally repugnant."  Sue McDroy is working with the  Green Women's Caucus and with  a nameless independent coalition  of groups and individuals to fight  against the uranium industry in  British Columbia.  "We want to get a permanent  ban on uranium mining. We  don't want just another moratorium. And we want people to be  aware of Canada's role in the nuclear industry.

KINESIS~E»*^_jy Across B.C.  ///////////////a  Vancouver flips  COPE stumbles,  Campbell crows  by Esther Shannon  It's almost as if Gordon Campbell, Vancouver's new mayor, has stolen a tactic from  the reds in Peking and decided that billboard smiles are a virtue at all times, not  just during election campaigns.  Campbell, whose election billboards littered the city since early summer giving ample evidence of the financial clout behind his  campaign, has simply changed his message  from pleading for votes to sunny thanks for  Vancouver's endorsement of his party, the  Non Partisan Association (NPA), and for  his successful bid for the mayor's office.  Apparently Campbell has plenty to be  thankful about. His party all but routed the  Committee of Progressive Electors (COPE)  from the municipal political scene, winning seven of the ten aldermanic seats on  city council, eight of the nine School Board  seats and the full seven seat slate on the  Parks Board. Vancouver's other two municipal parties, the Civic Independents, traditional COPE allies and The Electors Action  Movement were shut out in the election.  Campbell and the NPA with the aid of a  lot of money, have changed the face of the  city's politics and many are still wondering why it happened. And there is plenty to  wonder about. The city's voters gave a convincing mandate to the NPA but it was a  victory clouded with charges of media bias,  manipulation and misrepresentation. Kinesis talked with COPE candidates and members about why COPE lost so heavily in  Vancouver.  Margaret Birrell, organizer for COPE's  successful 1985 School Board election and  Bruce Yorke's 1985 run-off contest, firmly  believes that COPE could have won the  election.  Too Much Emphasis on Mayoralty  Race  While Birrell is the first to point out that  there was "tremendous media bias" against  COPE during the campaign, she holds that  a. concentration on leadership instead of  "the candidates behind the slate" and a  misguided foray into Vancouver's west side  were what truly sank COPE's campaign.  "Rankin," said Birrell, "could have won  with a good vote on the east side." As for  Campbell, Birrell says, "it was logical for  him to come oyer to the east because he had  the west sewn up."  Libby Davies, returned as a COPE alderman for her third term, told Kinesis that  COPE's "east side slate voting held its nor  mal strength." Davies cited a number of factors in COPE's defeat, including "loss of  pockets of the centre vote, and a very effective scare campaign by NPA supporters"  (against Harry Rankin, COPE's mayoralty  candidate, who was branded every shade of  socialist by columnists, editors, advertisers  and even, at one time, by the United States  government).  Davies also noted that voter indecision  on the mayoralty race "spilled over into all  the slates", and pointed out that the NPA  "must have spent close to a million dollars  on their campaign. That kind of spending,"  she said," was unprecedented in Vancouver,  perhaps anywhere in Canada on a municipal level."  Susan O'Donnell, another COPE member active in the campaign, said the focus  on .the mayoralty race was COPE's major  mistake.  "COPE was mistaken," said O'Donnell,  "when it thought Rankin could pull the  slate along." Rankin had no appeal to the  centre vote and O'Donnell says, "was not  popular as a mayoralty candidate."  O'Donnell also said that "Rankin was  out of control throughout the campaign. He  was abusive, rude, and at times his woman-  Gordon Campbell has a string of issues  he says his administration will focus on over  the next two years. While it may surprise  some feminists, childcare has made it on to  the new mayor's priority list.  la an interview with Kinesis , Campbell said that he wanted to "put together a  comprehensive program for child care in the  city. We are prepared to assist with physical plant needs and grants in lieu (forgiving  municipal-related expenses instead of providing funding) but we cannot go it alone  and will be looking to get the federal and  provincial government fully involved."  Campbell said the present child care system may be too restrictive because "it is  only set up on a 9 to 5 or 8 to 6 basis that  doesn't take into account people who work  split shifts or weekends." He also said there  should be no limits on access to child care  and that people "on U.I. or welfare should  also have child care available to them."  Campbell goes on record on women  Campbell's focus on child care is interesting. For starters it's an issue that will  win him political points with a broad section of women voters, obviously an important concern for the NPA. Child care is  also an issue which the federal government  has pledged action on, most recently in late  November when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney promised the first ministers conference held in Vancouver that "a substantial  allocation of resources would be set aide  for child care." Mulroney said he hoped,  provincial social service ministers could begin child care negotiations in January.  Identifying municipal child care as a priority dependent on provincial and federal  government means Campbell has an issue  with appeal and two convenient scapegoats  if no improvements in child care materialize.  On the city's community grants program,  of special importance to women's groups,  Campbell said the NPA has "no intention  of cutting the number of grants awarded."  He also said, however, that "my perception  is that there is a problem with how we issue our grants in that they are decided behind closed doors by bureaucrats." He told  Kinesis that "community grants should be  dealt with in public and with today's community in mind, not awarded on the basis  of decisions made ten years ago."  Campbell also said he is still committed to city council's unanimous decision last  June to go to the province for funding for  transition house facilities in Vancouver.  "I will try and work with ,the provincial government to produce funding for additional facilities and a resource centre."  Campbell complained that the transition  house issue has been used by some "who are  looking for purely political solutions when  what we need are solutions."  Campbell says he is not worried that  the NPA coalition will have problems with  unity. "I've always said that the NPA represents a broad range of concerns and backgrounds, I'm not threatened by disagreement."  hating attitudes were evident, particularly  at COPE's meet-the-candidates women's  brunch."  Davies believes that Rankin was COPE's  best choice for mayor. "Harry Rankin,"  Davies said, "topped the aldermanic polls  in the last election and had the most experience of all the COPE candidates."  Sadie Kuehn, former COPE school board  member who lost her seat in the election,  agrees that COPE should have talked more  about the Aldermanic, School Board and  Parks Board races but thinks the major factor in COPE's loss was that "a lot of people  felt secure that COPE would do well, and  they didn't get out to vote." According to  Kuehn, "there was a lot of confusion about  what was at stake in this election."  In defense of COPE's focus on leadership,  Kuehn noted that "there was a lot of interest in the mayoralty race." She cited all candidates meetings that would attract no one  unless the mayoralty candidates turned up.  Kuehn also told Kinesis that COPE "had  a clear understanding that the NPA was going to focus on Campbell as a young, fresh  face," in effect making leadership an issue.  Sue Harris, another COPE candidate  who lost her seat on the Parks Board, believes that the central problem with COPE's  campaign was that "we didn't turn out the  vote." She said that COPE "canvassed as  much as it could but it seems that half way  through the campaign, people changed their  vote." She attributed the switch to "an anti-  communist scare."  Harris also believes that "the NPA  jumped on a post-Expo band wagon," and  utilized what she called "the politics of  est", a strategy geared to ignoring problems, avoiding policies and simply focussing  on positive, upbeat messages. According to  Harris, "a lot of people are so frustrated  with the British Columbian economy that  instead of ... (wanting) ... an analysis  of why Vancouver is in such a mess, they  wanted and bought a fairy tale."  Michelle Valiquette, another COPE member, believes that the "whole election focused more than it should have on leadership," and she also said that that focus, "is  a media and right wing tactic." Valiquette  said that while she always thought "Rankin  was risky because of the power of the right  and red baiting, it was not a mistake." According to Valiquette, the left "has to get  Please continue next page.

Criminologists  now recognize that the "breakdown of family relationships may have the unintended  and undesirable impact of decreasing the offenders' ability to avoid criminal activity after release."  Conjugal visitation rights are provided in  return for good behaviour. The woman is a  carrot for trade by the Correctional Service.  These rights are seen as great advances by  prisoner reform groups, by feminists as the  use and control of women by men.  Another reward, the issue of temporary  passes, sets the woman up to be her husband's jailor. He may only be released into  the trusting arms of his wife on condition  that she be responsible for his behaviour.  She is expected to act as his chauffeur, bank,  parole officer, and care giver.  Controlled By Corrections  Women often complain about the degree of  control the Correctional Service has over  their lives. They cite difficulty in making important decisions about where to live, how  to find work, what schools their children  should attend. Vital information is kept  back by Corrections. Although the crime is  their partner's, they soon find themselves  immersed in a relationship with the bureaucracy that is as intense and humiliating as  if they were the criminals.  The most important information needed  is about transfers to other prisons. Many  prisoners are moved frequently, often from  one end of the country to the other. Poverty,  isolation, and uncertainty are realities for  the woman who decides to relocate with  him. It's hard to say if the poverty is a result of the many moves or if the woman remains unemployed in order to be flexible in  the face of this uncertainty in her life.  She even feels controlled when trying to  make friends. Often behaviour of the wife  less, he relies on his partner to do a lot of his  business. In her spare time she navigates the  jungle of correctional bureaucracy: making  appointments, attending hearings, doing research, making phone calls, and appealing  decisions.  Life as a single mother is difficult even  at the best of times. Finances are a major  worry complicated by the fact that many  prisons are isolated with only expensive  transportation links. A prisoner's partner is  also responsible for supporting him when he  is released on temporary passes. Although  a two-adult family at this time, benefits are  only allocated for one.  Women also worry about their children  suffering because of their father's offenses.  Prejudice in school and in the neighbourhood are constant occurrences. The children  quickly learn to be secretive, perpetuating  the isolation and loneliness of their prison  families.  Direct Intimidation  Before permission is given to enter a prison,  the visitor must consent to be physically  searched. Although guards do not exercise this right every time, the anticipation  of being searched causes stress. In Ireland  where women are often strip searched, such  searches have become a symbol of British oppression.  Even if clearance to enter is granted the  visitor often does not know if she will be  turned back at the gate. With procedures  varying a lot and no reasons given, she is  vulnerable and powerless. She is not seen as  an inconvenienced person in her own right  but "as an extension of the man inside. Generally speaking, if the man is known as a  doper, for example, the woman is more suspicious to the guards."  As prison culture is really only a microcosm of society it's not surprising that  women visiting inside also put up with abusive behaviour by men. The main difference  is that if she 'makes a fuss' she could lose  visitation rights. As one visitor theorizes, "I  got a lot of hostility from one guard and a  few other guards I know. It was like that because I chose an inmate, it was like somehow I was snubbing them. I never reacted  and I didn't say anything. One guy always  made nasty comments like he'd like to put  his hand up my skirt."  So Why Stay?  Why does a woman choose to stay in such  an oppressive relationship? Such questions  only enhance the isolation already felt by a  prisoner's partners. This fear of judgment  creates the secrecy that makes participation  in lif eskills or assertiveness training very difficult.  Fortunately, there are at least three  houses that shelter women visiting prisons  away from home. (There are sixty penitentiaries confining men in Canada). Sylvia  Griffith, co-ordinator of the John Howard  Society's home in Abbotsford, is proud that  she can offer "a place! where they (the  women) are accepted and"where they do not  have to justify their relationship. They have  often been ostracized by society."  As one woman recently put it, "I think  women need self-help groups, just to learn  how to be strong; not to let men walk over  you in prison, to be a step ahead of them-  to learn that you don't have to take shit  from them." Some support workers would  hate to see special skills groups set up just  for prisoners wives. The prison sub-culture  is isolated enough and women need to join  community groups already in existence. So  provided she can find child care and afford  course fees, self-help is possible—given community support that is.  A change in public attitude is in order  and that will only come about with the  careful documentation of the experiences of  women who have relationships with men doing time. ■  "Life on the Outside" is available free  of charge from Correctional Service of  Canada, 82815 S.

A Rough Ride  Both Birrell and Davies believe that, in  spite of the NPA's major victory, Gordon  Campbell and his party are in for a rough  time during their stint in city government.  "Campbell's biggest problem," said  Davies, "is that he has a bunch of people  who agree on some things but don't agree  on most things." She notes that the NPA  has traditionally run on a platform of getting politics out of city hall, but says their  lack of cohesion will mean, "we may see politics we've never seen before at city hall."  Birrell said the NPA will have a tough  time dealing with "factionalism" and that  its "big majority will mean a more rapid  disintegration of whatever unity they may  have."  On the question of what the NPA victory will mean for women in Vancouver, everyone agreed that it will be very important to carefully monitor some areas. The  city's equal opportunity program, community grants, parks and recreation programs  and the School Board all merit special attention. Klllllll  Sadie Kuehn said that she "hopes the  NPA is wise enough to realize that the ed  ucation system has been savaged and needs  to be restored." She thinks "we must.at first  wait and see what happens."  Both Davies and Harris, pointing to  Campbell's and the NPA's record, believes  that women and other groups are in for a  struggle.  "He (Campbell) is going to move real  fast," said Davies. Davies said she is particularly "concerned about the city budget and  whether the NPA will introduce cut backs."  KINESIS    Dec/ran-ir Across Canada  Feds attempt to mutilate U.I. system  by Patty Gibson  Women beware! Although the Forget  Commission of Inquiry on Unemployment Insurance has yet to announce its  official report, two leaked documents in recent weeks indicate forthcoming recommendations that will all but gut the existing  benefits program.  It is sixteen months since the Mulroney  government first established the royal inquiry into unemployment insurance (U.I.)  and by the time the report is placed before federal cabinet, it will have cost the  unemployment insurance system more than  $6 million. And if the government actually  adopts the major thrust of the Commission's recommendations, the total .cost to  unemployed workers and their families will  spiral toward billions of dollars.  The Forget Commission itself is hopelessly divided at this point. Members include Commission Chair Claude Forget, a  right-wing economist and former Quebec  Cabinet Minister; two labour representatives from the Canadian Labour Congress  executive; two business representatives and  a social science professor.  Labour representatives Jack Munroe and  Frances Sabota have already written a minority report denouncing the Commission's  draft recommendations. This report and the  first draft of the Commission's official report were leaked to the press in early October; both indicating Canada's unemployment insurance system is in for a rough ride.  Proposals included in the official draft  would cut the government's share of the insurance program by at least $3 billion. At  the present time, the $12 billion program is  cost-shared: $8 billion coming from workers  and employers; $4 billion coming from government coffers.  The road to securing the government cutback would mean reduced benefits for an estimated seventy-eight percent of all U.I. recipients. This would be achieved primarily  by lengthening the working time necessary  to qualify for benefits and by eliminating  programs that now enable recipients in high  unemployment areas easier access to benefits. British Columbia for example, would  lose an estimated $30 million in benefits; an  incredible sum given the extreme levels of  unemployment plaguing this province.  The Forget Commission would also like to  axe the number of unemployment insurance  staff working at national headquarters by  fifty percent and regional staff by thirty five  percent. Besides throwing about 2,000 more  gainfully employed workers onto the unemployment rolls, this proposal also means further delays in the processing of claims.  Getting nervous? You should be.  Forget will also recommend eliminating  short term job-creation workers from the  benefits program. Moreover, he would like  to axe all federal short term job-creation efforts and direct money saved from this initiative to small businesses.  In a recent press statement labour representative Jack Munroe attacked the Commission's forthcoming recommendations as  anti-worker. "The report that we saw will  savage the whole unemployment system,"  he said. "There is no way we were even  prepared to consider what the report contained. It was, and as far as I know is, the  most vicious attack on unemployed workers  since the 1930's."  Government cutbacks m$  would mean reduced  benefits for an estimated  78 percent of U.I. recipients  Government expects the Commission's  official report by December 1. From here,  a bill to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act will be drafted. It is at this juncture in the process that we can expect an organized outcry from labour, women's, community and anti-poverty groups; many of  whom have already presented their views to  the Commission's across-Canada tour last  year.  Consistently, these groups called for increasing benefits, cleaning up unnecessary  red-tape that results in substantial delays  for most recipients, improving the appeal  process, making part time workers eligible  for U.L claims, and increasing job-creation  efforts.  The Forget Commission has not operated  in isolation from a number of other initiatives taken by the federal Tories since their  election. Proposals contained in the Wilson  Economic Statement, The MacDonald  (Royal Commission on the Economy)  Report and now the Forget Report, taken  together with the free trade initiative, provide a clear understanding of the direction  Mulroney's Conservatives are taking.  Instead of providing jobs for the two  million Canadian's now out of work, Mulroney's government appears poised to rip  out the safety net. Despite double-digit unemployment and a rapid decline in the  amount of disposal income available to millions of Canadians, the federal government  is continuing its attack on all social programs.  The National Action Committee on the  Status of Women is currently preparing a  campaign to defend the unemployment insurance system. High on the list of concerns  specific to women is the potential removal of  maternity benefits from the U.I. program.  In addition, the vast majority of part time  workers in Canada who are not eligible for  benefits are women, and of course, the combination of official statistics and estimated  'hidden unemployed' statistics place women  in the majority of unemployed workers.  Women are well-advised to keep an eye  on upcoming legislation and prepare themselves to work in whatever way they can to  stop the U.I. program from further erosion.  The government has shown its hand. Nothing less than a concerted effort on the part  of trade unions, women's, and anti-poverty  organizations is required if Canadians are to  retain the U.L system in its present form.l  Trail cleaners  from page 3.  plaints.

This argument doesn't sway  Charleen Davidow however. "So  what if they have families," she  said. "These guys are young men  and skilled. But the women are  fifty-five at least and with no skills.  What jobs are open to us?"  Local 480 members, with the exception of cleaners, also have the  resources of a job relocation service  available to them during periods  of unemployment. Women, on the  other hand, have little opportunity  to develop skills which would move  them into higher-paying jobs in  the industry. At present there are  ten women working in the plants  alongside 1,600 men. Davidow explains that office cleaner jobs are  often used as stepping stones for  women to get better paid work  with Cominco.    "But if cleaning  how will women get those other  jobs?"  "The union's telling us we should  have backed down a long time  ago," said Davidow "But Geor-  getti and Schmidt (Local 480's vice  president) are the ones who taught  us to be shop stewards ... taught  us to fight to the end. no matter what. We want to thank Mr.  Georgetti and Mr. Schmidt for our  excellent training."  Davidow is quick to add that  she and the other women are pro-  union.

Sporr said the board has been  "uneasy" about the number of  abortions performed in Vernon.  According to Sporr, the board  compared the abortion to birth ratios of hospitals in four similar  communities and found that Vernon's abortion rate (18.4 percent)-  is five times higher than the average.  The board's findings, however,  failed to consider that many women  travel to Vernon to have abortions.  Fifty-four of the 142 women who  received abortions in Vernon last  year came from other communities.

The other three  were Chilliwack, Langley (where  there are no therapeutic abortions  performed) and Penticton Pentic-  tons abortion rate is 22.7 percent.  Sporr admitted that the board did  not take into account any abortion  restrictions in these communities.  The board's action reflects their  interpretation of Section 251 of  the Criminal Code which prohibits  abortions except in cases where  continuing the pregnancy wouldN  endanger the life or health of the  woman. Section 251 is currently  being challenged under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the  Supreme Court of Canada, which  is not expected to issue a ruling for  at least eighteen months. (See Kinesis November '86.)  Sporr said, "Until (the Courts)  decide, the board felt they had to  continue in the spirit of the Criminal Code."    The board believes  Section 251 does recognize the fetus as a person. "If parliament  had thought (the fetus) was not  a human being (the abortion law)  would not be found in the Criminal Code."  The situation at Vernon's Jubilee Hospital is reminiscent of a  similar situation in Surrey in 1981.  At that time, a newly elected  anti-choice board disbanded the  hospital's abortion committee and  the doctors withdrew from sitting  on committees in an administrative strike. The action eventually immobilized the hospital and  forced the provincial government  to step in. The abortion committee was reinstated, although access  remains limited.  When asked if doctors in Vernon would be prepared to take  similar steps, Forsey noted that  in the Surrey incident: "Nothing  happened for six months, then the  government stepped in. With the  change in government since then  ... I'm not so sure (of provincial  support)."sj  KiNEsrs 'SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS/SSSSSSSSS/SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS  //////////////////^^^^^  ///////////////////////^^^^  No Name Column  Disappearing children and disappearing solutions  by Nora D. Randall  What do kids know? I have twenty  of them between the ages of eight and  eleven on my bus. I used to have  twenty-one. But this one native kid  named Sam, I took him to school the  first day and when I picked him up he  came out of the building Hke a shot. He  stormed on the bus and muttered, "I  don't like that." That was on a Thursday. By the next week he was maybe  coming two out of five days so I had the  dispatcher call his mom and see what  the story was. After my run I got a note  in my box that said Sam was a NGTFN  which means "no go till further notice."  The dispatcher said he was probably in  a foster home. And that was the last I  heard of Sam until about a month later.  One morning Bill, a white kid, got on  the bus and said, "Sam's in the hospital." Richard, a native kid, said, "No  way." Bill said, "Is too." Richard  said, "Who told you that." Bill said,  "I called his house and his mom said  he was in the hospital." Richard said,  "I don't beheve it." Bill said, "You  can even call her and ask her yourself.  Sam's in the hospital." Richard said,  "Nah, I don't beheve it. She just said  that cause he's in a foster home and  she's too ashamed to say so."  Well Bill didn't have any comeback  for that one and frankly neither did I. If  Richard was right it was a pretty amazing thing for a ten year old kid to figure out. I told the dispatcher what the  two kids had said. She thought Richard  was probably right.  Things went along without Sam or  a mention of him for a month or so.  Then one Monday I stopped outside of  Steve's house and instead of Steve, his  dad came out. He's a native guy, and he  came to the door of the bus and said, "I  got kind of loaded Friday night and the  welfare took 'em, eh. I'll let you know  when I know anything." I drove away  without Steve and the bus was quiet for  three minutes. That may not sound like  much to you but it is eternity to twenty  eight to eleven year olds.  The next day I went down to a day  care centre which Helen, a friend of  mine, runs, to interview Mary, a native woman I'd talked to when I was  writing a play with native characters  in it. I was hanging around the front  desk waiting for Mary and the video  crew to show up when a white social  worker stormed in and disappeared into  a back room. (I knew she was an official right away, because she was dressed  differently than the rest of us and she  didn't stop to talk or even let Wendy,  the receptionist, know what she was doing there.)  Pretty soon, we hear a woman  yelling, "No fucking way!" The woman,  who is white, came out of the back  and said, "Get my kids out of there  right now. We're going." The social  worker follows her and shouts, "Come  back here and finish this. You're making a mistake." The mother bolts and  goes outside. The social worker follows  her. They shout at each other outside in front of the centre. The social  worker comes back in and marches into  the back. The mother comes in and is  wandering up and down the hall, shouting, "Fuck off."  I pass her on the way to the back.  She says, "Pardon my language, but  I'm so upset." I can sure understand  that. I'm upset myself and so are all the  women who were standing around the  front desk talking and so is the day care  staff who keep popping out into the half  to see what's going On and so are the  kids who peek out from behind the' day  care workers when they open the door.  The social worker comes and tells the  mother to get her kids. They are all going to the doctor together. The mother  storms into the day care centre to get  her kids. The social worker follows.  Wendy goes into the day care centre  to tell the social worker it's not alright  for her to be doing this in the centre.  The social worker doesn't respond. She  gives us all a hostile look and marches  the mother and her children out to a  car.  One of the women who has been  standing around the desk starts to cry  and talk about the abuse she experienced as a child. I turn to Helen and  say, "That social worker has a bad attitude." Helen says there's nothing she  can do. She lost the fight to handle  things differently.  The video crew arrived and set up.  When they were ready, Mary sat in  front of the lights and I sat under the  camera and asked fieT questions. She  talked about how she started her first  group on her reserve after the Department of Indian Affairs decided to move  her band from their island to Port  Hardy. How her mother helped her  start the group and how, at first, all  the ladies were pretty hung over and  couldn't do much. So Mary started  having a raffle at every meeting and  whoever won the prize that week had  to have the group to her house the next  week. That gave the women a reason  to clean up the house because people  would be coming over. After awhile  they began doing other things hke holding bake sales and such and pretty soon,  if there was a fire or something in the  community, they would get together  and do something about that.  Mary also talked about how she  started the soup and bannock group at  the day care centre and a craft group  at a local church and a button blanket  group that met in homes and how she  goes where the need is. She said she  figured out what to do by going around  asking people how they were doing.  Mary talked about how sometimes it was  easier for a woman to join a craft group  than an alcohol or problem group. She said  women would come to the craft groups and  get to talking about their lives and discover  they weren't the only ones with problems.  She told the story of one lady, who quit  smoking and drinking after forty-five years  once she started going to the craft group.  Mary said she thought it might have been  easier for her then going to an alcohol group.  Mary said she thinks the whole thing  is mutual support. I asked her if she  got paid for starting these groups. She  said, "No, not now." I asked how she  supported herself and her family. She  said she was on welfare and that she  got a widow's pension ... but welfare  took most of that. Then the interview  was over and the video crew turned off  the lights and Mary went into the back  to make soup and bannock and I went  back to work.  One day soon after that Richard told  me that Sam was in the hospital after all. "He is," I said. "What happened?" "I don't know," said Richard.  "I thought he was in a foster home," I  said. "I think he is," said Richard "but  he's in the hospital." "I wonder what's  going on," I said. "He split his head  open," Richard said.  This didn't really answer my question so I called Helen to see if anything  had happened after that day at the day  care. The story Helen told me was so  complicated that when I tried to write  it down it didn't come out nearly the  way it happened. I'm leaving it out for  now because I think it's really important to get it right. It explains how  child abuse is handled and how people  lose their children. One thing is clear,  however, and that is that as soon as any  agency or organization suspects that a  child has been abused they are legally  bound to report it. That protects the  agency but is not necessarily the best  or even any protection.for the child.  I found all this pretty disturbing.  What ends up happening is that middle class women fight with poor women  over their children and, in the majority of cases, it means middle class  white women fighting with poor native  women over their children, which is why  I thought it was important to mention  people's colour in this story.  Back on the bus, Harry, another native kid, had the latest word on Sam  Bill said, "I guess Sam's not in the hospital." Harry said, "He is so. His father whacked him in the head. That's  why he's got stitches? ■  program v°ur  de/iveriesand  save a bundle!  683-1610  683-2696  1501 -925 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C. V6C1R5  PIGEON  NEED   INFORMATION?  WANT TO  TALK?

Thompson is legalh  I Cloud  Thomp-  tates to  rt battle  and the  kd reta-  Shaxon wasn't expected to live through that first night, and for the first  month or so her life was very much  in danger. During that time, things  went as smoothly as things can go. I  offered Sharon's parents, who live in  Hibbing, Minnesota, the keys to our  house, and told them that they were  welcome to stay there indefinitely if  they wanted. They did move in—and  I don't really know what happened,  whether they found something at the  house or just started to guess the ex-  bidden to visit tent °* mv l°ve f°r Sharon. In any case,  £»ttw *.^ey move<i out> an(l I was taken out  - of Sharon's hospital room and told that  friends weren't supposed to visit as often as I was visiting, that family could  meet all of Sharon's needs, that no one  could love Sharon as family did, and  that if I didn't cease visiting so often  they'd see to it that I couldn't visit at  all.  *e«, the  by Karen Thompson  1^  Sharon and I were lovers for four  years before the accident. We had exchanged rings; we were in a committed  relationship and planned to spend the  rest of our lives together. The accident  occurred in November of 1983. Sharon'  was hit by a drunk driver and suffered  what's called a "closed-head injury,"  which means that some brain cells have  been permanently damaged, while others have been only partially injured and  can be retrained.  The night of the accident I got some  inkling of the hell that was going to follow. When I arrived at the hospital I  was told nothing. I wasn't family, so I  couldn't find out, whether Sharon was  dead or alive. I spent two hours just  trying to find out if she was alive. That  gave me a clue as to what would be going on for the next while.  That sent me to a psychologist to ask  what I should do. I felt that Sharon's  parents knew about our relationship  and were in a state of denial, and the  psychologist told me that I should come  out to them. We decided that the best  way would be in a letter sent to them in  the privacy of their own home, so they  could experience there any initial pain  or frustration and then come back to St.  Cloud having worked through enough  that we could all sit down and discuss  what was best for Sharon.  But their response to the letter was  that I was a crazy, sick person, that  there was no way Sharon was a les-'  bian, that I had made it all up, that  they never wanted to set eyes on me  again. In fact, they tried to get Sharon  out of St. Cloud Hospital as soon as  possible—they wanted me never to be  able to visit with her. They wanted to  take her to Hibbing Hospital, which is  more convenient for them but doesn't  have the rehabilitation facilities St.  Cloud does.  'When Can  Sharon  I allowed Donald Kowalski to be appointed Sharon's legal guardian in a  settlement that also protected all the  things I felt were important except  guardianship: I had equal access to and  visitation with Sharon and equal input  into her medical and financial affairs,  and by court order she could not be removed from St. Cloud without either  mutual consent from me and her pari  ents or a court order.  Prom the day of that settlement, I  was in court every four weeks or so.  Donald Kowalski filed one motion after  another to try to remove all my visitation rights and move Sharon from St.  Cloud, and I went through every day  fearing it might be the last day I would  have the chance to visit with Sharon.  In July of 198J>, my nightmare became a reality. Sharon's father was  granted full guardianship with unlimited power, and within twenty-four  hours he decided that I was never to  be allowed to visit with Sharon again.  That order didn't just eliminate me  from Sharon's life. It also eliminated  a lot of her friends from the six years  before the accident, and it barred her  court-appointed attorney and the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union from visiting. You can't visit now without her  father's permission, and he got an unlisted phone number so that he can't be  contacted. It's almost impossible to get  in to see her. She's being kept a virtual  prisoner in an institution.  I want to stress that the two or three  years after the sort of accident Sharon  had are the primary learning time for  motor and cognitive retraining, so time  is of the essence. Sharon doesn't have  the time that our legal system has taken  fighting out this case. Each day that  passes without proper care and support  lessens the quality of her life for her life-  That's a quick look at the sequence  of events; now I'd like to mention some  of the key issues in the case. Ob-  yiously, Sharon's medical condition is  one—and it has been misrepresented in  many ways by the straight press and  the court system. What is the threat  of this case, that people are willing to  hide the facts?  Sharon has been described by her  parents, their attorney, and the straight  press as a quadriplegic totally helpless  mentally and physically, totally incompetent, incapable of making any decisions for herself or communicating her  wishes in any way. They claim that  she can't read consistently even at the  single-word level—yet an occupational  therapist has documented that she cal*  read a paragraph forty-two words in  length and answer questions about it  with 100 percent accuracy.  They claim that she can't comprehend what's said to her—yet she has  typed the answers to questions from  A to Z. ("Do your parents, ever tell  you what's going on?" "No." "Do  your parents ever ask you what you  want?" "No." "Do you want to be asked  what you want?" "Yes." "What are  you and Karen?" "Gay." "What does  it mean to be gay?" "To love someone of the same sex." "Have you exchanged rings with Karen?" "Yes."  "Why?" "Because we love each other."  "What did you do prior to the accident?"      "Teach."     "What did you  That sent me to an attorney. I  wanted to know if they could move  Sharon because it would be more convenient for them, even if it wasn't in her  best medical interest, and if they could  decide who could and couldn't see her.  I found out that they could do both.  I learned that the only way I could  gain any legal right—have any say at  all—would be to file for guardianship.  I- didn't really care whether I actually got guardianship, which is given  to "the most qualified person" under  Minnesota law. What I cared about  was protecting Sharon's best interests,  Her parents response  was that I was a crazy,  sick person, that there  was no way Sharon  was a lesbian, that I  had made it all up.  which I think I'm "most qualified" to  do. Speaking only medically, I studied physical and occupational therapy  in college, and my Ph.D. work was in  the psychology of sport, in the motivation for learning, which is the key to  work with brain-injured patients.  But, after I filed for guardianship, I  decided to settle the case out of court—  probably my first big mistake. I should  have pursued guardianship all the way  at that time, but I was scared. I was  very much in the closet, and I was  scared that things would come out in  the open and affect me on the job and  in other places. I wanted to keep them  as quiet as possible, as long as I could  protect Sharon's right to the best possible medical care, her right to see the  people she wanted to see and be where  she wanted to be.  10 KJ N ESFSflsb>ffian'l7Jj  Kowalski  Come Hornet  teach?" "P.E." "What grades?" "seven  to ten." "What would you do if someone stopped breathing?" "Mouth-to-  mouth." )  They claim she can't respond to auditory commands—yet it's documented  that in physical therapy during the  nine months she was in St. Cloud she  was able to sit unaided and shift her  weight on command. She was gaining  head and trunk control—yet she's been  transfer-carried since she was moved.  She was starting to eat and swallow—  yet she's been fed through a tube since  leaving St. Cloud.  We even have a videotape of Sharon  doing the things they say she can't do—  yet it's been ignored by the courts because it wasn't made by a doctor.   In  split-second any of us could become  Sharon Kowalski. We could be disabled  through accident or illness, and this  case could be used to take our rights  away from us.  I maintain that even if Sharon were  incompetent, she shouldn't have been  removed from the environment where  she was making the most progress.  Sharon is being denied the basic right  to recovery: all the evidence shows that  people recover to a higher degree when  they go home as quickly as possible after an illness or accident, and St. Cloud  has been voted one of the twenty-five  best cities in the nation in terms of  handicapped services. What would do  more for the quality of Sharon's life:  living in her home with attendants taking care of her when I couldn't be there,  Ihe homophobic court system and medical  profession would rather declare a person  totally helpless— mentally and physically -  than deal with the issues of the case  it you see Sharon do some typing and  answer my questions with finger movements and head shakes. She takes a  glass and drinks from it, she taps and  curls her fingers individually on command, she brushes her teeth and washes  her face and combs her hair, she plays  checkers with me. Being an athlete, she  didn't want to work with blocks, so I  brought in balls for her to work with—  and you see her taking a ping-pong ball  and touching her chin with it when I  ask her to.  This very vitally alive human being  is being denied the right to have input into her future—she is not even allowed to be in the courtroom when it  is being determined—because she has  been declared incompetent. The homophobic court system and medical profession would rather declare a person  totally helpless mentally and physically  than deal with the issues of this case,  and every single human being should  find that threatening. Yes, there are  gay rights issues involved; I firmly beheve this wouldn't be happening to us  if we weren't gay. But there are also  key human rights and disability rights  issues involved.  The precedent that's being set in this  case is that a human being can be. denied the right to be present when her  future is being decided upon, that a human can be kept from having any say  in what's happening to her even though  she can type words, phrases, sentences.  This is appalling and frightening; it's  establishing case law that could be used  not only against gay and lesbian couples and unmarried heterosexual couples living together but against every  single human being,  as well.    In one  going in to St. Cloud Rehabilitation  Centre for her therapy, going to volleyball matches and basketball games and  church and all the other things she did  before the accident—or staying in Hib-  bing's Leisure Hills Nursing Home?  When the Minnesota Civil Liberties Union (MCLU) appealed the  court order granting Donald Kowalski  full guardianship, it was temporarily  stayed. I got in to see Sharon for  five days then, and nursing notes document the positive results of my visits.  When she saw all the typing Sharon did  and all the exercises we did together,  the director of nursing said, "My God,  Sharon has not done anything like this  in the three weeks she's been here. And  I never expected she would be able to."  Her typewriter had been left at a previous nursing home which hadn't bothered to tell anyone that she could communicate in any way, and for three  weeks she'd been treated hke a vegetable. After my visits, the occupational therapist wrote a report saying, "It's obvious that Sharon performs  at different levels for different people. When her former roommate was  present, Sharon did things she hadn't  done before." But the day after I was  denied further visitation, this therapist  had minimal response from Sharon, and  the day after that she had none. Since  that five-day period in August of 1985,  I have not been allowed to see Sharon.  The logic behind this is, in part,  "Let's end this conflict by removing one  of the parties. Obviously, her parents  are always going to be her parents, but  this other party doesn't have to be involved, so let's remove her."  In other words, "Let's remove the  conflict by removing the one party  who's been trying all along to remove  the conflict, and give all the power  to the party who won't do anything";  when I've asked the court to require  counselling for all parties, I've been  told, "You can lead a horse to water but  you can't make him drink," and when  I've suggested church mediation to the  Kowalskis they've refused. I've also  been kept away from Sharon because  one of her doctors said that our prior  sexual relationship made him fear "sexual abuse"—homophobia pure and simple.  My relationship with Sharon has very  much been made an issue in this case,  with the Kowalskis claiming that I'm  a sick, crazy person who made it all  up. We've been forced to prove a relationship that we spent four years trying to hide. I had been scared to  death when Sharon told me she wanted  to tell her work supervisor about our  relationship—but thank God she told  somebody about it. If it Had ben left up  to me, nobody would have known, and  I'd have no proof of our relationship.  Before coming out in court, I asked  •Sharon what we should do, and she  said, "Yes, we should come out." We  laughed about it—I said, "Sharon, don't  you think I'm the most likely person to  be advocating gay rights?" She thought  it was a stitch, because I hadn't even  used the word "gay" before the accident.  I spoke out finally for many reasons.  We needed power. We couldn't fight  the old boys' club that was at work in  this case without the MCLU and the  disability rights groups, and I had to be  able to talk to them openly. I finally  realized that as long as I was scared  and invisible, I would be vulnerable; I  was much more vulnerable in the closet  than I am out. People were threatening  me, saying, "We'll get even with you,  you bitch," and some actually attacked  me verbally and physically. I finally got  it through my head that by not being  willing to come out and take a stand, I  was saying there was something wrong  with me.  Reaction was mixed. Some disability rights groups have told me that although they beheve Sharon's disability rights have been flagrantly violated,  they can't afford to get involved in  a gay rights issue. But I've received  other letters, too. One was from a  gay man whose lover had died of cancer.    He told me how they got sepa  rated in the final months, how he lost  most of his belongings because everything was in the other guy's name, and  he said, "Thank God you're fighting  this in the open—we were scared." And  I heard from a lesbian whose thirty-  two-year-old lover was dying of complications from a kidney transplant. She  said, "We were afraid to fight it, and  we got separated. At a time when my  lover needed me more than any other, I  wasn't there. Thank God you're fighting this."  I sat with tears running down my  face, and I thought, "My God, how  many people are going through this?  Why can this be done to us?" Then I  took it a step further: "My God, what  if these people had fought? Maybe  Sharon and I wouldn't be going through  this today." If Sharon and I don't fight,  if we don't speak out about what's hap  pening to two human beings, how many  more people will have to go through  this? This case has to be won.  I've spent a year and over $90,000 in  our legal system, only to arrive at not  seeing Sharon. But I still think we can  win, and I have made a commitment to  stay with this case until we do. I'm here  because of my love for Sharon; I want  to take her home, and I think we have a  right to find out what our relationship  can be. I don't want to see her sacrificed for a 'larger cause', but if we don't  win, the cost will be far bigger than  the one to Sharon and me. Sometimes  I'm afraid that we'll run out of time if  we can't pressure the system to move  faster, but I think we will win eventually if we can keep up the fight. So I'm  travelling to gain support from people  across the nation, to help them understand what's going on and how it applies to them.  The last time I saw Sharon, she typed  out to me, "Help me, Karen. Get me  out of here." I had to look at her and  say, "Sharon, I'm doing everything I  can, and I will never quit fighting this.  I've got to go now. My time is up."  And she typed, "Please take me home  with you." Sharon is still there,  Leisure Hills Nursing Home.

Karen Thompson and Sharon Kowalski.  KINESISnJgg/-i"w^3^fjH International  Greek women on the cusp of change  by Muriel K.L. Sibley and Patricia A.  Clark  We creep and slither down the steep  trail from the road to the cemetery,  the May sun warm on our backs and  the familiar, pungent scent of wild  thyme prickling our noses. We have to  scramble to keep up with our friend,  Katerina, the young Cretan countrywoman; her ,surefootedness, as well as  the many runs in her black stockings,  indicate how often she has made this  trip through the thistles and scrubby  brush.  At last we reach the stone walls of the  little churchyard—the special 'burying  church' used only for funerals—and go  inside. The graves are raised, rectangular tombs, like cement beds, with 'headboards': glass-fronted cases containing  photographs of the deceased, oil, incense and plastic flowers. We wait inside the gate while Katerina goes to the  newest grave.  Only twenty-nine years old, Katerina  is a widow of six months and has become a member of that vast army of  Greek women in black, who mourn.  Traditional mourning periods are long,  years, and even decades long in the case  of a close relationship, so that most mature women are in black for most of  their lives, mourning for one relative or  another. Katerina has lost her young  husband early—he was murdered—and  years from now, when her mother and  father die, she will still be wearing  black.  Katerina moves briskly, cleaning the  glass, filling the oil lamp, straightening  the picture. She lights the incense in  the censer and circles the grave, praying and swinging trails of sweet smoke  as she walks. In her black clothes, the  sweater sleeves pushed up over thin,  strong arms, she carries out all her prescribed duties despite the heat, her visitors, and her own sadness. In many  ways she epitomizes both the strengths  and the strictures of traditional Greek  womanhood.  Like women throughout the world,  Greek women have had to bear both the  burden of societal discrimination and a  statutory framework that supports it.  In the long run, neither can be changed  without the other, though sometimes,  as in present day Greece, the laws have  outstripped the culture. When the socialist party of Andreas Papendreou  came to power in 1980, sexual inequality was identified as one of the major  problems of the country, and a programme of specific statutory changes  and social mechanisms was begun to  liberate women and help the family as a  whole. In April, 1983, the government  created the Council for. the Equality  of the Sexes, whose stated aims were:  "To promote and put into practice the  equahty of the sexes in law and in reality. To propose the necessary and feasible measures which the state, local government and the social agencies should  take to bring about that equahty. And  to monitor and control the implementation of these measifres."  In the three years since its establishment, some potentially revolutionary  laws have been passed. The UN International Convention for the elimination  of all forms of discrimination against  women was ratified. Women and men.  now share jointly in the responsibilities  and rights of marriage; women are required to keep their own names when  they marry; and the dowry, which by  implication reduced the • woman to a  burden to be shouldered by her husband, and for which indemnity had to  be paid by her father, was abolished.  Formerly only attainable by adultery or  insanity, divorce by mutual consent was  introduced, as well as equal rights for  children born outside of marriage.  Of special interest to women in  Canada perhaps is the Ministry of  Labour's Law 1483 which permitted,  among other things,  the granting of  'parental leave' for up to three months  for each parent during the period from  the end of maternity leave to the point  at which the child reaches two and a  half years of age. This was the first  time, in the legislation of any country,  that the father's right to share in the  upbringing of his child had been established by statute in a personal and untransferable form.  Vitally important for the large population of rural women was Law 1287 of  the Ministry of Social Security, which  provides the Greek woman farmer with  her own full and independent pension.  These are only a few of the impressive statutory changes which have  been enacted to safeguard the equality of the sexes. Social services and  benefits are also being established to  support these laws, though because  of lack of funds, these are still few  and spread thinly, with such amenities  as government-sponsored day care centres, family planning clinics, and career  counselling offices usually only available  in the large urban centres.  Under the aegis of the Council for  Equality, the Mediterranean Women's  Studies Institute was created to research and dispense information on the  status of women. We visited its office and met with its director, Eleni  Arnopoulos-S t am iris.  The day we visited, she and her two  assistants were busy with last-minute  preparations for the Annual Women's,  Studies Summer'Prbgram t#be"held on  "Thirty-one percent of the total work  force is women, and nearly half of those  are agricultural workers. Yet they .have  controlled none of the money and have  been subordinate to men in all spheres.  We women in Greece are far behind you  in the west. The only books we have in  women's studies are in English. Translations are expensive. How can you educate people without books in their language? There is not enough money. We  have such a long way to go."  We protested that some of the new  Greek laws were more progressive than  we had yet in Canada.  Ms. Stamiris shrugged her shoulders.  "Well, yes, the laws are good, but it is  hard to implement them at the grassroots level. The old court structures are  still in place, with the same judges and  lawyers filling them. Age-old attitudjes  are hard to change."  Who is a better symbol of those age-  old attitudes than Katerina, dressed ii  black? Five years ago Katerina was  on the eve of marriage to the 'catch'  of the village, Costas, a young ship'  engineer who worked part-time for the  merchant marine and part-time on his  farm. They had waited ten years to  marry; Katerina had had to assemble a  dowry, and Costas the money to build  a house. Katerina had little education but was skilled in housewifery and  farm work.

By village standards, they had married late, but the marriage was quiqdy  followed by the arrival of three children in four years. Twelve days after  their third chfld, and second girl, was  born, Costas was shot and kUled by a  man who had quarreled with him over  a right-of-way to a sheep pasture.  It was a complicated family quarrel;' the murderer (who has since confessed and been sentenced to life imprisonment) was Katerina's uncle. Seventy years old, his values are from  an earlier era, when questions of honour and territory were commonly settled with knives or guns. (Land disputes are still frequent, largely because  of the dowry and inheritance systems  which divide and subdivide property  into small and sometimes widely separated parcels only accessible by rights-  of-way through other people's land.)  When we visited the village Katerina  talked about her uncertain future. She  has found part-time, menial work in  Published Quarterly by  Vancouver Women's Health Collective  888 Burrard Street  12 KJNES1S nearby town, but it is not enough to  support her and the chUdren. Her parents are helping her, but they are old,  and she knows that not only can she not  count on their help for much longer, but  they "may themselves become an additional burden. Her house is mortgaged  and she worries that the bank may foreclose. Above all, she fears for the life of  her son. Her uncle's family has made  direct threats, and in Crete such treats  are neither made nor taken lightly.  She could move her family to a different city where'she could find better  work and feel safer, but Katerina has  never been out of her vaUey and lacks  the education and training to find a better job.  Katerina now lives for her son, little  Yorgos. If she manages to hold onto the  house, it is for him. She counts on him  to finish the house, to take care of the  family, and in some way to put right  the great wrong done to them. She has  more faith in the four year old boy and  his destined authority than in the authority and efficacy of the government  and its laws.  After the visit to the cemetery, we  leave Katerina at her house, saddened  by the thought of the enormous burden that the small, male child is already  carrying, and by the reverence with  which he is regarded by his mother,  grandmother, and tiny sister. Almost  the last sight we had of the chUdren was  of them standing together, the little girl  leaning trustingly against her brother,  whUe he put a protective arm around  her.  Four hours by car from Katerina's  vUlage home is the capital city of Crete,  Iraklion, where Helen, her friend and  ours, hves and works. Helen is from the  same viUage and is about the same age,  but there the similarity ends; Helen,  by all appearances, has moved beyond  Katerina in independence and freedom.  She benefited from an education, having been sent to school by her parents  and then to a hotel school on the island  of Rhodes. She worked in hotels for several years and studied simultaneously  to be a tour guide, which she eventuaUy  became qualified for. It is a demanding career, requiring expertise in several languages as weU as knowledge of  Greek history, culture and archaeology,  and it is also one of the highest—paying  jobs to which Greek women have access.  WhUe in her early twenties Helen  married a feUow-employee at the hotel, and although he left that job and  worked fitfuUy thereafter, they were  happy for a few years untU the baby  came. After six months of staying home  with little Alexandra in a small apartment, Helen was frantic with boredom.  Her husband at first refused to let her  go back to work, but then said that if  her mother, the baby's grandmother,  would care for Alexandra, he would  agree to it. Helen's mother, who had  taken a job in a small factory when  her husband died, is an unusual Greek  woman: she preferred the independence  that, widowhood had given her to coming to care for her grandchild.  Things were at an impasse for awhile,  with Helen growing more unhappy and  her husband staying out more. He  was becoming absorbed by the men's  life-style of Greece, which meant hours  spent at tavernas with male comrades,  and occasional, not-too-discreet, adventures with other women. His jobs  grew even more erratic. Money became  a problem for the famUy and eventuaUy Helen had to return to work. Her  husband came home infrequently and  finaUy moved in with another woman;  Helen's mother capitulated and came to  look after the child.  Helen is now seeking a divorce. But  she is worried about money. She  worked steadUy all through the marriage, except for the year that Alexandra was  a baby,   while  her husband  President (left) and secretary of the Women's Agri Tourism Co-operative at Petra.

Our three friends, Katerina, Helen, and  Maria, are representative of millions  of Greek women today, some of whom  have been swept into the main stream  of change, whUe others are caught  in cross-currents or trapped by back-  eddies.

She has lived in 24 foster  homes. She is native Indian.' All 24  foster homes were non-native.  • A woman has moved to Vancouver  from northern British Columbia with  her child and boyfriend. The child is  apprehended by the Ministry of Human Resources (MHR) because of neglect occurring while the couple are  drinking. The woman agrees to an  alcohol treatment program before her  child is returned to her. She is a status Indian from a Manitoba band and  if she goes to Manitoba, the band will  pay for her treatment. The woman is  sent to Manitoba. The child is sent to  the Yukon because it is easier to find  a native foster home there. The man  remains in Vancouver trying to find  work.  • A native band in British Columbia  watches MHR remove over 150 of its  children—almost a whole generation  —during the 60's and 70's. As the  grown children begin to find their way  back to the band community, it is obvious they suffer from severe emotional problems. Most have great difficulty integrating into the community. Some do not succeed. Some  commit suicide.  These stories are not rare or exceptional,  they are the everyday stories of thousands  of native people involved with the child welfare system in Canada.  The Indian Homemaker's Association of  British Columbia estimates that at least  forty-six percent of children in the care of  the Ministry of Human Resources (MHR)  are native (30.8 percent are reported by  MHR as status Indian; Indian Homemaker's  estimates an additional fifteen percent as  non-status and Metis). That figure compares with an estimated four to five percent  of native children in the general child population of the province.  For most of the native children in MHR  custody, the child welfare system is not  working. The likelihood of a native child returning to her natural parents after MHR  apprehension or being placed in a native foster home is extremely low. The likelihood  of a native child finding a stable foster or  adoptive home is far lower than for a non-  native child. In whatever institutional or alternative home the native child finds herself, her cultural heritage is likely to be devalued, negatively compared to 'white' society, or ignored.  For hundreds of native children, "child  protection" means a life cut off from their  families and culture, a life of shunting from  one strange home to another, a life in which  family or a sense of identity and belonging  are foreign concepts.  For the natural families of these children,  the burden of personal grief and loss cannot be measured or even imagined. But for  those families, child protection has meant  more than personal loss, it has meant nothing short of the destruction of a people, for  if the culture is not passed on to the children, no-one carries it on. -~3,  According to Rose Charlie and Kathleen Jamieson of the Indian Homemakers'  Association; the situation "falls within the  United Nations definition of genocide ... It  is our experience that many apprehensions  are without due cause and are unwarranted;  they occur as a result of cultural biases,  discrimination or misunderstanding ... we  know about the despair of the families who  have lost their children to this system and  about the suffering of the children who are  torn away from their families and put into  foster homes or institutions. These are the  children who grow up to fill penitentiaries  and skid rows and to die violent deaths." 1  The practice of removing native children  from their families is not new in the history of white settlement of North America. "Early settlers on the eastern seaboard,  scandalized by 'pagan' and 'primitive' child  rearing practices, forcibly removed a number of native children and shipped them to  England to be 'christianized'. 2  The process of enfranchisement also attempted to break native people's connection  to their ancestry and culture. Many traded  in Indian status for the "benefits" Ottawa  offered in exchange—such as, the right to  vote, enlisting in the army, the right to enter  a bar and buy liquor, and for women, marriage to a non-Indian—in short, the benefits  of assimilation into white society. In practice, enfranchisement meant neither they  nor future generations of their children had  the right to be registered as a member of  a band, to live on a reserve, or receive any  funds or financial assistance given to status  Indians.  Later in this century, the health care system removed native children to foster homes  or institutions when they were undergoing  medical treatment away from their families'  villages. Many were never returned home.  Eventually, the education system played  the biggest role, forcing hundreds of native  children into residential schools where they  were separated from families for ten months  of the year. Beatings and humiliation were  common methods used daily to rid the children of their native ways and train them to  adopt white christian ways.  The residential schools were finally closed, due to public criticism and to the financial costs of maintaining them, but there are  those who claim that the child welfare system has simply taken over where the residential schools left off. Since the early sixties, native children have been apprehended  by provincial social services at an alarming  rate. In addition, thousands were sent out  of the country for adoption, in what is described by native leaders as blatant "traffic  in native children."  In 1955, only one percent of children in  care in British Columbia were of native ancestry. By 1964, that figure had jumped to  thirty-four percent and by the late 1970's to  thirty-nine percent. It is now estimated at  between forty and forty-six percent.  In his book on native child apprehension  author Patrick Johnston referred to the 60's  and early 70's as the "Sixties Scoop"— a period when native Indian children were literally scooped from their homes "on the  slightest pretext" .3  In Johnston's book the reasons for the  "scoop" are described as well-meaning on  the part of front-line social workers—a concern for the "best interests of the children."  "They felt that the apprehension of Indian children from reserves would save them  (the children) from the effects of crushing  poverty, unsanitary health conditions, poor  housing and malnutrition, which were facts  of life on many reserves ... ".  But "the long-term effect of apprehension  on the individual child was not considered  ^VT'NtJr were the effects of apprehension on  Indian families and communities taken in  account ..."  The real reasons for the high rate of  native child apprehensions are numerous  and complex, according to Johnston. A ma  jor factor is the jurisdictional dickering between federal and provincial governments  over who is responsible for child welfare services to Indians on reserves. The Indian  Act holds the federal government responsible for all legislative matters regarding  "Indians and lands reserved for the Indians". However, the federal government argues that education and social welfare are  the jurisdiction of the provinces. Not surprisingly, the province argues these services  for Indians should be provided, or at the  very least paid for, by the federal government.  Apprehend First, Question Later  In 1962, the federal government struck  an agreement with British Columbia and  handed over responsibility for administering child welfare on reserves. No consultation with native people ever took place  over this transfer. The federal government  agreed to pay 100 percent of the costs of  taking a child from a reserve into MHR  care, and of a status child from off-reserve  who met certain criteria. (All Indians living on reserves must be status Indian, although many status Indians also live off reserves.) Meanwhile, funding is not provided  for other social or family support services  on reserves, and child protection money is  available only after a child has been apprehended. This funding structure, according  to the Indian Homemakers, "clearly constitutes an inducement to the province to apprehend first and ask questions later."  The situation for urban native people is  not much better. Regardless ^jheir sta- -  tus, urban native people are expected to use  whatever provincial social services are available to the general public. Deborah Mearns,  president of the Vancouver Indian Centre,  says there are an estimated 30-40,000 native Indians in Vancouver. "Those people  are more comfortable going for help to their!  own people who understand their needs,-but j  there are not services for urban native peo-!  pie run by native people .... The child wel-j  fare system and existing social services are!  not meeting the needs of native people."  Donna Hill, program manager of the Na-j  tive Police Liaison Program, says: "MHItj  takes whatever family unit exists and frag-,  ments it further. They are really good at!  persuading a mother to give up her children.  And if a mother goes to MHR for help and  gives up her children voluntarily on a temporary basis, they are still considered apprehended." After five months of temporary  custody, MHR can apply for permanent cus-  jJPfe jsithout directly notifying the parent.  The parent is served a summons to appear  in court and on appearance must prove why  she should get her children back.  The Indian Homemakers' Association  points to recent provincial cutbacks as  added stresses on an already inadequate system, that have worsened conditions for native parents and children. Severe cuts in legal aid have made fair treatment in family court almost an impossibility. And increased caseloads, due to social service cutbacks, have put enormous pressure on social  workers—whether or not they have racist  attitudes—to apprehend with too little investigation.  As the provider of one of the only advocacy services for native parents in Vancouver, the Homemakers' experience is that  "Many parents go to the Ministry of Human  Resources for help but they do not understand the rules, the concepts or the terminology and they may sign away their children into permanent care without knowing  that they are doing so."  Hill blames the values of a predominantly  white middle class social welfare system for  the high rate of apprehensions. Hill says  MHR's definition of parenting excludes the  concept of the extended family so important  to native culture, and discounts the native  approach to child rearing and teaching. "In  a native community, other members of the  family—grandparents, aunts, uncles—often  take over the care of a child if a parent  cannot do it for some period of time ....  And native people teach their children to be  independent. They let them learn on their  own, in their own way. So they don't necessarily always know where their kid is every  minute."  Researchers have pointed out different  child rearing practices that can easily be  misinterpreted by non-native observers as  neglect or lack of discipline: "... the Inuit  considered it demeaning for an adult to become angered with or annoyed by a child  .... The development of positive and appropriate behaviour in children was fostered  by public opinion and the use of community  approval or disapproval. Humour and teasing were employed as a means of discipline  ... ."4  "Then there is the 'dress code' of MHR,"  Hill adds. "If a child looks dirty—has a dirty  face and her clothes are all dirty—well, that  doesn't mean the child didn't start out clean  in the morning."  "We're given all kinds of labels," Hill  continues, ^^wedjcated,' our communities are 'rife with alcoholism', we're inot  good parents'. But what do they offer a  child instead? Food and shelter is not good  enough."  There has been much criticism from native groups of MHR's emphasis on material standards for judging the adequacy of  a home. Physical requirements such as bedroom and room sizes and material things  available to the child, have not taken into  account the economic conditions of native  people in general. MHR also does not allow  for the lack of emphasis on material possessions as a measure of success in native world  view. "They (MHR) want the kids to have  nice things and a nice home. The mother is  supposed to be at home smiling in a nice  shiny kitchen with an apron on. Well, native women don't do that. You won't find an  apron in most native homes. MHR is trying  to impose another set of values," says Hill.  The same kinds of criteria have made  it very difficult to have native families accepted by MHR as suitable foster homes. AH  the women interviewed agreed it wasaiext  to impossible, once they found a native famUy willing to take in children, to have them  pass MHR requirements. According to Hill,  if a child is placed in what is considered part  of her extended family, MHR provides less  financial assistance than it does to a family  that is unrelated to the child.  Solution: Native Control  Native spokeswomen know that there  are serious social problems facing their  own people. They are concerned about the  breakdown of extended family support, the  frequent lack of parenting skills among  young parents, about problems created by  lack of adequate housing, about alcohol  abuse, about long-term poverty and economic dependence on the welfare system,  and about the child abuse and neglect that  does occur in their communities.  Marjorie White, Coordinator of Urban  Images for Native Indian Women, describes  the difficulties faced by native people coming to cities: "People need to understand,  we have had a different life, a different upbringing than non-native people. Many of  us are the products of the residential school  system"— a system which is one of the most  cited explanations for the lack of parenting  skills in young native people. Removed from  the contact, love and teaching of their parents and elders, many had no one to learn  from.   ■>',.■  " ...; we are also the products of the  lifestyle on reserves in small communities.  My father was a fisherman and didn't work  by the clock or on a structured schedule.  Indian people come to the city and they  don't know how to live in this structure—  the nine-to-five life. They are used to the  extended family. They have never faced the  problem of finding child care or a babysitter in a strange place."  Where there are real difficulties, the dominant culture attributes them to inherent  weaknesses in native people and answers  them with programs designed to promote  assimilation. But native people convincingly  trace most of their troubles to the economic and social destruction of their people  deliberately carried out by European settlers. The "wholesale removal of native children from their families and communities by  MHR" is simply a continuation of that process.  The solutions proposed by native people  all have one principle in common—native  control. With the growing move toward native sovereignty and independent economic  development,-has come a growing awareness  of the need to protect the most important  resource of all—the children. Native women  leaders are at the forefront of demands for  Native control over independent child welfare services.  One by one, native bands and alliances  have struck agreements with governments  for native control of child welfare. In 1981,  the Spallumcheen Band in British Columbia  passed a bylaw giving itself "exclusive jurisdiction over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child" in their community. On Thanksgiving Day, 1981, over  1,000 marchers in the Indian Child Caravan  converged on Grace McCarthy's front lawn  to demand full cooperation with that bylaw  from MHR. Since that time, the band has  operated its own child welfare services unchallenged.  The Stony Creek band near Vanderhoof  in northern British Columbia has developed a Child Welfare Committee including  elected native community members who actively participate in family counselling and  advise family court judges. The Nuu Chah  Nulth Tribal Council is now in the process  of developing an independent child welfare  service for thirteen tribes on the west coast  of Vancouver Island.  Across Canada, ground breaking agreements have been reached—in Alberta between the Blackfoot Band, the federal government and the Alberta government. In  Manitoba, an agreement between the federal government and the Four Nations Confederacy has paved the way for independent  child welfare systems to develop, and has  drastically changed the nature of child welfare services for at least some native people.  But in British Columbia, these types of  agreements still only affect a small minority  of native people. The Indian Homemakers'  Association says that a piecemeal approach  across the country is not enough. They recommend federal legislation that will spell  out required procedures and ensure recognition of Indian extended families and Indian control of child welfare. Similar legislation already exists in the United States.  Deborah Mearns of the Vancouver Indian  Centre supports the development of native  controlled social services that can meet the  needs of urban native people. "Money is being poured into the system now, but it's not  going to succeed. The only people who can  make that happen are native people. We  need control of native social services, and  we need the funding to carry them out effectively."  "No matter how well-intentioned anyone  else is, the only people who can address this  problem are native people. And we should  get support for that." ■  In February 1987, The Vancouver Status  of Women will sponsor an evening of speakers on Native ChUd Welfare.

January 1, 1987 wUl see new provisions in  The Canada Pension Plan come into effect as a result of the Task Force report,.  Understanding the pension scheme is  not easy. This article wUl unravel it  and show The Canada Pension Plan  (C.P.P.) effects women differently than  men. The proposed reforms improve  matters but do not change the basic  discriminatory reality of the pension  scheme. The article wUl conclude with  a look at the equahty section of The  Charter of Rights and Freedoms to see  if the C.P.P. may be declared discriminatory under Section 15 of the Charter.  The goal of Canada's retirement income system is to ensure that an individual's income is not drastically reduced by retirement. Canadians want  elderly people to have an income that  wUl keep them out of dire poverty.  These remain goals, not reality. The  C.P.P. is one source of retirement income, private pension plans another.  Who do these plans cover? How much  income do these plans provide to elderly  people?  The C.P.P. is reaUy three different pensions: The Canada Pension,  (Quebec has its own, almost identical plan), Old Age Security (O.A.S.)  and The Guaranteed Income Supplement (G.I.S.). The O.A.S. is the universal program that provides monthly  benefits to almost everyone in Canada  over the age of 65. It is what everyone calls the 'old age pension'. The  G.I.S. is income-tested and is intended  for those elderly citizens who have no  income other than the O.A.S. In fact,  half the elderly population receive the  G.I.S. in addition to the O.A.S. The  G.I.S. benefit decreases as income other  than O.A.S. increases. One interesting  fact about who gets G.I.S.: 65 percent  of the single elderly people compared to  Theories of Equality  Up to now four main theories of  equality have been developed. Each is  rooted in and lending support to a particular set of assumptions about society and about the distribution of power  between men and women in society.  These four theories and their relation  to sex discrimination are:  The conservative view:  This theory would admit that while  men and women are equal in some fundamental sense, they are also 'natu-  raUy' different, and the differences justify a 'separate but equal' treatment  under the law. The result justifies  'apartheid' in the form of the segregation of women—keeping us in the home  fulfilling these tasks for which we are  best suited.  The liberal view:  Liberal theory advocates 'equality of opportunity'. A liberal view of equality assumes that sex differences do not matter,  that men and women should be treated  as autonomous individuals. However, traditional liberalism also ignores the fact that  men and women have been treated differently and therefore fails to deal with the existing disadvantages experienced by women  in trying to gain access to 'opportunity'. .  The liberal feminist view:  This view, also known as the sex differences view, would grant equal treatment to  those who are 'relevantly the same' or are  'similarly situated'. This theory opposes discrimination where there is no apparent reason why men and women should be treated  differently, but would allow discrimination  where a difference between men and women  was defined as relevant. It assumes a 'list'  of sex differences, divided into those which  matter and those which do not. The 'differences' approach would support affirmative  action to redress the effects of past discrimination.    .  The 'inequality'approach  This view starts from the assumption that women are in fact disadvantaged and would propose that a law be  assessed according to whether it had  the effect of systematically disadvantaging women because they are women.  This approach would ignore the questions of whether there are differences  and if so whether they are relevant and  go straight to the question of whether  the effect of the law is to perpetuate  the negative consequences of discrimination against women.  43 percent of married elderly people. In  June, 1984 O.A.S. benefits were $266.28.  a month and the maximum G.I.S. benefit for a single person was $267.33 a  month.  The Canada Pension is based on contributions made by every person between the ages of 18 to 65 in the  paid labour force, including the self-  employed and part-time workers. Contributions are calculated at 1.8 percent  of an employee's contributing earnings  and are matched by the employer. Only  a portion of an employee's earnings,  those between the exemption ($2,000)  and maximum ($20,800) as set by the  Plan, are used in the calculation of the  contribution. The individual's retirement pension is 25 percent of the average of his/her total pensionable earnings between 18 vand 65 years of age.  The average is based on the number of  years the worker could have been in the  labour force rather than on the actual,  number of years.  The changes to the Plan that wUl  come into effect January 1, 1987 wUl  change the maximum pensionable earn-  percent of men in the labour force participate. Private pension plans then are  limited in the amount of retirement income they contribute to elderly Canadians: 12 percent to the income of elderly couples and 11 percent to the single people.  Given the basis of how the C.P.P.  works, we can begin to see how it is that  so many more women than men over  the age of 65 are poor. The Canada  Pension is calculated on how much is  earned and on how long an individual works., The statistics on women's  earnings and participation in the labour  force are weU known. Women earn  about 56 percent of what men earn  and fewer women than men are in the  labour force.  In 1981, 63 percent of women between the ages of 20 and 64 contributed  to the C.P.P. while 91 percent of men  contributed. Also wages earned tend to  increase as one gets older but only 42  percent of women aged 50-64 worked  whUe 82 percent of men in that age  bracket worked.  I  ings so that they wiU be calculated annually and tied to a Statistic Canada  figure based on weekly wages caned  the Industrial Composite. Also under  the new Plan contributions would increase extremely gradually (by 0.2 percent next year and 0.15 percent in each  of the next twenty years).  Adding the maximum Canada Pension benefit to the maximum O.A.S.  and G.I.S. gives a monthly amount  of $662 to a single person in June.  1984. This payment means that the income was $1,500 below the 1984 urban  poverty line or was equal to one-third  the average industrial wage in Canada.  Women tend to work in part-time  and low-paying jobs and do not work  for as many years as men. As long  as women are confined to job ghettos,  earning substantially less than men,  their contributions to pension plans wUl  be less. The result of contributing less  is that women's retirement income is  much less than men's. In 1983 the average pension paid to retired men was  $6,846 whUe the average paid to women  was $4,345.  The average C.P. retirement pension  in 1984, per month, was $220.79 for  men and only $148.90 for women. Remembering that 75 percent of aU elderly single pensioners are women, note  that a single pensioner's income in 1984  In 1983 the average pension paid to retired men was  $6846, while the average paid to women was $4,345.  To bring this public pension income  above the poverty line the pensioner  must receive income from an industrial  private pension plan.  Canada's retirement income system  depends on private pension plans to  supplement the C.P.P. However, in  1984, company pension plans covered  »nly 47 percent of paid workers, this includes public sector employees. If public sector employees are not counted  then only 34 percent of the labour force  is covered by employer sponsored plans.  There is also a marked split in participation along sex lines. Of women working in the private sector, only 19.6 percent belong to a private plan. If the  public sector is included then 34.6 percent of aU women in the paid labour  force participate in a plan whUe 50.6  in Vancouver was   £2,799  below  the  poverty line.  What of reform then? In 1987 O.A.S.  and G.I.S. wUl be increased. O.A.S.  wUl go up $3.14 a month. G.I.S.  for single pensioners with no other income wiU go up $3.73 a month. The  Canada Pension wUl not be increased.  Three areas of The Canada Pension  that effect women wUl be changed:  credit-splitting, survivor's benefits and  a homemakers pension wUl be introduced. Credit-splitting means that the  pension credits of married spouses can  be divided as a famUy asset. The new  provisions no longer restrict the division to divorced couples. The pension  credits can be divided where the married spouses have been hving separate  and apart for at least one year.  They  ra6igN£^i^cDaiaa^i>i LESBIANS AND GAYS  HOW  LONG,  HOW  LONG?  need only have cohabited for one year—  formerly they were required to have cohabited for at least three years.  Credit-splitting only apphes to legaUy married couples. Another limitation is the requirement that the separating couple must make an apphcation  to the Minister of Health and Welfare.  Credit-splitting benefits higher income  contributors, after all sphtting a little  means each gets less. As weU the requirement of applying likely means that  the separating spouses are dependent  on their lawyer's advice, if they have a  lawyer.  Survivor's benefits are 60 percent of  the fuU C.P. received by JhJIxleceased.  The new changes allow the reduced  pension to continue to be paid even  if the survivor re-marries. The average survivor's pension paid is $164 a  month. This change effects approximately 35,000 people  because  those  Section 1 5, Charter  1. Every individual is equal before and  under the law and has the right to the  equal protection and equal benefit of  the law without discrimination and,  in particular, without discrimination  based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, mental  or physical disability.  2. Subsection (1) does not preclude any  law, program or activity that has as  its object the amehoration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or  groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national  or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex,  age, or mental or physical disabUity.  who have lost the pension wUl be reinstated.  The most controversial amendment is  the homemaker's pension. This pension  wUl only benefit the increasingly smaU  number of women who remain at home  with no income other than their husband's. Homemakers earnings would  be assumed to be half of the maximum  pensionable earnings under the C.P.P.  and the pension they get upon retirement would be hah0 of the maximum  pension. If the homemaker becomes  a worker in the paid labour force she  would keep the credits earned while a  homemaker.  These three areas: credit-splitting,  survivor's benefits and homemaker's  pension improve the situation for women in a heterosexual, or higher-income  relationship. These reforms do not  assist single women, women in low-  income relationships where a share in a  by Barbara Findlay  low pension is not worth much. In fact  statistics show that couples are better  off in retirement then singles, partly  due to marked differences in provincial  income security benefits between couples and singles. Again, remember that  75 percent of aU single elderly people  are women.  Canada's retirement income scheme  obviously benefits men and women differently. There are more differences  then just the ones discussed. Can we  now analyze the C.P.P. in terms of  the theories of equahty set out in the  November issue of Kinesis? (See box).  The plan was put into place by liberals who see men and women as autonomous individuals. Liberals do not  acknowledge existing disadvantages in  society effecting individuals. As a result the Canada Pension Plan perpetuates low incomes for women, as compared to men, into their retirement.  The Plan does not take into account social reahty such as unequal pay for work  of equal value.  A liberal interpretation of the C.P.P. under Section 15 of the Charter would find  that the C.P.P. is sex/gender neutral in  setting out who is entitled to contribute  and in calculating the entitlement to a pension. The Plan applies equally to both men  and women in the sense that everyone is  given the opportunity to benefit by it. The  Supreme Court of Canada, analyzing the  C.P.P. in terms of the Charter, would likely  accept the hberal view and go on to find,  further, that the Canadian government is  justified in basing the Plan on contributions. It would be difficult to change the  very basis of the Plan, in existence now.  However, if we apply the "inequality"  approach, as described in last month's  article on equahty theories, we come  to another conclusion. The inequality  approach looks at whether the effect  of the law is perpetuating the negative  consequences of discrimination against  women. The figures cited on pensions show clearly that women are disadvantaged by the Plan. The Plan  does not take into account women's  lower incomes and lesser attachment to  the work force. Until we have true  equality of job opportunity and equal  pay for work of equal value, a retirement income scheme based on contributions and length of time in the work  force wUl not put elderly women on an  equal footing with elderly men. UntU  there is equality for women in the work  force legislation such as C.P.P. should  be revamped to protect elderly women  from the extreme poverty they are condemned to because the legislators refuse  to face facts. ■  Before the Charter of Rights was enacted, lesbians and gay men in B.C. had  no legal protection against discrimination. They could lose their jobs, their  apartments, and their chUdren because  they were homosexual. Neither the  provincial Human Rights Act, which  apphes to provincial matters, nor the  federal Human Rights Act, which apphes in the federal sphere, outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  For that reason you would think that  lesbians and gay men would be particularly relieved at the enactment of an  equality rights provision in the Constitution. Can lesbians and gay men rely  on Section 15, the equahty rights section of the Charter? The answer is:  maybe.  Chi a first read of Section 15(1) you  would think that lesbians and gay men  were clearly protected. The section begins 'Every individual is equal before  and under the law and has the right  to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination  ... .' But the section goes on ' ...  and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or  mental or physical disabUity'. Conspicuous by its absence from the list is 'sexual orientation'. The legal question is  whether lesbians and gay men are protected by the opening words of Section  15(1), even though sexual orientation is  not specifically hsted.  When the Charter was being drafted,  lesbians and gay men tried, unsuccessful, to have 'sexual orientation' added  to the list of specifically prohibited  grounds of discrimination. By refusing  to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground, but including the general, opening words of Section 15, the  legislators have shifted the question of  whether lesbians and gay men are protected by the Charter away from the  pohtical realm and into the courts.  Because Section 15 of the Charter  has only been in force since AprU,  1985, there have been no cases yet reported dealing with whether Section  15 protects lesbians and gay men from  discrimination. But when the case  is taken, it wUl be the courts which  decide, for now and for the future,  whether lesbians and gay men are protected by the Charter.  The federal government apparently  believes that the courts wUl find that  sexual orientation is protected by the  Charter. It has recently announced  that it would amend the federal Human  Rights Act to outlaw discrimination on  the basis of sexual orientation. They  said that they were doing that in order  to bring the Human Rights Act into line  with the Charter of Rights.  There was a terrific public outcry  at the idea of gay men enlisting in  the army, or the RCMP. The Attorney  General of Nova Scotia announced that  if that was the effect of the Charter, his  government would pass a law to operate notwithstanding the Charter, which  would prevent homosexuals from being  on the pohce force.  When the question of whether lesbians and gay men are protected by  the Charter is settled by the courts,  the effect wUl be far-reaching. If lesbians and gay men are protected by  Section 15, then it could be argued, fc  example, that lesbian and gay couples  are entitled to be treated hke heterosexual, married couples, or hke heterosexual, common-law couples, under the  law. That would affect such areas as income tax law, pensions, 'matrimonial'  property, and custody.  On the other hand, if lesbians and  gay men are not protected by Section  15, then Parliament has the power to  make homosexuahty a crime again. It  is only since 1969 that gross indecency  was taken out of the Criminal Code.  And the provinces could pass laws refusing to hire lesbians or gay men in  schools, forbidding them custody? of  their own chUdren, or authorizing discrimination in housing.  Perhaps no issue more clearly illustrates the importance of Charter litigation and the role the courts wUl play—  whether we are paying attention or  not—in shaping 'rights and freedoms'.!

In an interview with Kinesis about the  situation in their country, two wonderful  women Ditchay Roxas and Ellen Ongkeko,  both members of PETA, offered the following observations and insights.  The February defeat of the Marcos dictatorship politicized many people in the  Philippines. The more than seventy per  cent of the population who make up the  lower classes realized the strength of 'people power'. There was a new concern about  politics in general. More people began to listen to the left, and question issues such as  United States involvement in their country.  The elections resulted in the establishment of a semi-coalition of conservative  liberals and progressives who shared political power. Althoueh ma*~ —  .,, uuiui it mere.

Here is where  the majority of the people live and where  the New People's Army (NPA) and the military clash most frequently. Although the  NPA is illegal because it supports armed  struggle, it is the 'legal' military forces that  the people are scared,of.  (The NPA waged a guerilla war against  the Marcos regime from its inception in  1969 to Marcos' fall from power. It was  founded by the Communist Party of the  Philippines (CPP) and in 1973 became tbe-  armed wing of the National Democratic  Front (NDF), an underground opposition  alliance launched by the CPP. Today the  NPA is active in two thirds of the Philippine  archipelago's 73 provinces. Cory Aquino's  new government is determined to negotiate  a settlement with the NPA despite the increasing opposition of the Philippines military establishment.)  The reality of conditions of life for the  majority of women who live in rural areas is  militarization or the threat of it. The military knows that the strength of the people in these regions is tremendous, and so  concentrates much of its energy trying to  crush it there. This pattern of oppression  that existed under Marcos continues today  through his supporters TM»>« ---  The Legend of Maria Makkling  Maria Makkling is the healer of the  Philippines and in scene after scene she appears through times of torture and oppression. For example in the case of Leena, a  factory worker in Manila Leena arrives on  stage alone and begins to show us her story.  Through mime she demonstrates the laborious nature of her work. She makes obvious  the degradation and harassment of her job.  A worker who is pregnant joins her and the  two of them share the pain of the pregnant  woman's misery. Then Leena is left alone  on the stage once again. Now we see her enraged at the injustices of the system. Soon  she is being tied up and taken somewhere to  be interrogated She begins to speak in her  own language. She is being tortured. Maria  Makkling the Protectress appears, gently  picks her up and lays her in her lap to care  for her. Leena is near death, if not already  dead In the background is a slide showing  the suffering of the people under Marcos.  Another slide is shown: the face of the  Protectress is above the crowds of the suffering people—and one solitary tear drop  is rolling down her cheek. We hear these  words: "We have survived so many crises.  Keep the fire of struggle burning, forging  new stories of vision and hope. The strength  of our people grows."  Towards the end of the play (as pictured here), she gathers some strands of  rope and people from different Sectors begin to weave their fabrics with these strands  to create a grand tapestry. There are the  sugar cane cutters from Negroes, Muslim  youth from the South, a Northern Itawi  woman, etc. The tapestry is her skirt. All  around her are banners and signs proclaiming: "develop people's culture! Uphold people's democratic rights! Build a self-reliant  economy! International solidarity for justice, freedom and democracy!"   « njuatever Uie cost.  It became difficult for them to talk about  women's issues when the matter of basic  survival was at stake.  Differep  priorities   exist  for  different  women. In the Philippines there are many  different women's groups that serve these  diverse interests. Some of the issues that  these groups deal with are discrimination,  abuse, the sex trade, abortion and lesbian-  Women, for instance, are often pulled out  of educational institutions to make room  for their brothers. These women are also  expected to work to put these same men  through school. Women must also obtain  higher marks than men in order to qualify     '  for medical school. This is in keeping with  the idea that women will marry and raise  families and never practice medicine anyway.  In Manila, there is widespread abuse of  female children by the family. These cases  are not reported to fchfc.police. As far as the  sex trade.busi^essfe concerned, women are  ' /,. v$Qp^p||rjgfe&i; sale and profit. Pornography ts an enormous business. Sex stores are  ^/}J-^ftsd,yri^i books from Germany and Japan.  '''^'Qfr'*'Institutes have no other choice of employ-  -'" *' 'vtttenK Machismo, money and the sex trade  are a well-known combination.  Women, however, recognize their need to  - begin trying to take control over their own  lives. As a result many women choose to  be part of one of the many women's groups  such as GABRJELA, which examines, articulates and acts to change the conditions  of women's lives. Men often attack these  groups, questioning the need for their existence as separate and different. Women reply that it is necessary to create opportunities to work from their own perspectives,  not someone else's.  All is not perfect.  There are powerful right-wing women's groups with well-  established links to the elite of Marcos' sympathizers. Issues such as abortion and les-  ' bianism are subjects of tremendous controversy within  the women's movement.  , Women become sick and die from self-  inthiced or back-street abortions.

Unfortunately for we poor Filipinos, the legend of Malakas and Maganda circa 70's to  80's took a horrifying, ironic twist: the parents had turned to monsters and post haste  ate their children."  But in the final analysis, as Ditchay  points O0,' *TJiere are many women's  groups in the Philippines And more than  any other sector they have managed to  bridge the pohtical chasms that exist among  them. Certainly there are problems but  women still have the best marches and the  best cultural, plays."  Women maintain a high profile in the  struggle Ifcjaphold the rights of the people.

GABRIELA has asked for a theatre  workshop and PETA has worked with them  on other projects as well.  Cultural workers definitely have their  place. In fact in some rural districts they  are more readily accepted than community workers. Numbers of community theatre groups have sprung up in the last five  to eight years, including peasant theatre  groups in rural regions. There is a large network of community theatres. They were all  active in the revolutionary movement but it  is only recently that they have been able to  speak out publicly.  During the Marcos regime, many cultural  workers were censored, tortured and forced  to flee to the mountains. Today some things  really have changed: with the good wishes  of Cory, PETA is embarking on this tour as  official Ambassadors of Goodwill.  Plans for the future?

People power in action! ■  The Crowd  In the first scenes of the play, the Narrator tells us that the 'V sign for victory or peace in North America signifies the  tyranny of Marcos in the Philippines. He  then goes on to teach us the people's sign  (which can be seen in this photo), which  means to fight, and asks aU of us in the audience to use this gesture when called upon  throughout the play. Audience participation  through dialogue, chanting and movement  is an invigorating element of Panata Sa  Kalayaan.  This photograph shows the scene of election day last February. There rings out  an exuberant continuous chorus of "people  power". The audience is invited on stage to  participate in the tension and excitement of  the event. A woman from the audience recalls how it was for her to be back in the  Philippines on that day. Many banners are  swinging in the background representing the  actors that we have just seen dramatized:  urban poor, the church, women, cultural minorities, etc. A soldier from the New People's Army can be seen. Flowers are given  out in celebration. (Some of the audience  could be seen crying silent tears of joy.)

Here Potrebenko muses on  how far she could have walked if she'd set  off across Canada at a mile an hour instead of walking picket duty at Bimini's and  Denny's.  Before I get too old for walking  I'd like to get to Newfoundland.  I've always wanted to visit Newfoundland,  Walking slow.  In another she talks about the end of a  relationship with a man who has gone off to  be a psychopath:  There's a woman lying on the sidewalk  near the door.  It isn't me.  I checked.  Her hair is black.  There's a woman screaming i  the c  It isn't me.  There are two women crying.  Neither one is me.  I checked.  My eyes are dry.  None of the poems are political in the  abstract. They are political in the everyday  realities of hair in the sink and having to  stand up on the bus.  The poems are funny (often at the same  time as they're political or lyrical). I'll quote  one in full:  Better you should learn wen do  Men protect women, a man once told  me indignantly.  Sure,  Some do.  Who do they protect them from?  Other women?  Children?  Wild rutabagas?  Rampaging rabbits?  The ironic distance which makes so many  of the poems successful is set up on the  inside covers of the book. The employee  performance evaluation reproduced there  shows Helen Potrebenko to be an excellent  dicta-typist, good at her work and enthusiastic and co-operative in the office. This is  the woman who writes a memo requesting  her  ...  retirement be  deferred by roughly 85 years and 10  months to accommodate the fulfillment  of my goal with the company.  Her goal is to type a million letters.  This is the woman who suggests in another memo that the reports she types are  an art form and should be framed and hung  rather than mailed.  This is the woman who asks  You think I mind about racism?  You think I mind unemployment,  despair, terror, desperation?  You   think   I  mind   that   civil   rights  doesn't mean for workers,  equality doesn't mean for Indians,  individual rights doesn't include strikers?  you think I mind about sexism? ...  you goddam fuc king right I mind.  This is a revolutionary disguised as a  mild-mannered dicta-typist Or maybe every dicta-typist is a revolutionary in disguise? ■  Summer Love educates young  by Kinesis Staff Writer  Summer Love is a comic book and an  innovative approach to educating young women about the consequences their early career expectations and choices have on their  lives. A project of the Women's Skills Development Society, Summer Love stars four  high school women who grow through a  summer of work and personal crises, to understand that being in control of your life,  and job prospects, is better than holding out  for fairy tale endings.  According to Women's Skills, the comic  book approach was "an effort to develop a  self learning tool that would reach girls before they made crucial high school course  choices. Choices that could shut them out  of almost a hundred jobs."  "Young women", says Donna Stewart, coordinator of the Summer Love project,  "are stiU thinking in Cinderella terms. We  found when we just told them the facts  about women and the labour force they became hostile, almost blaming the messenger." Summer Love's format is very accessible and its plot carries a message about  the economic facts of life in the eighties  which we hope will encourage women to  think about their futures realistically."  Summer Love will be distributed free  through British Columbia school boards,  guidance counsellors and the British Columbia Teachers Federation's Status of Women Committee. The comic book will be followed by a rock video with similar themes. ■  To obtain a copy of Summer Love  write: Women's Skills, 4840 Carson St.,  Burnaby, B.C.

This  second book is disappointingly uneven.  More often than I wished, I was given  only clever language meant to impress  instead of the briUiance of phrase and  exquisite insight Hartog has shown herself capable of.  The first and last parts of this three-  part book are devoted to lyric poems  many of which didn't entirely succeed.  Sometimes they are so close to showing  Hartog's true skiU that they break your  heart when they miss. More often, they  contain a few clever images which signal promise but this promise is never  fulfiUed. Instead the poems end weakly  or indecisively.  Hartog's best work happens when she  steps aside and lets an inner certainty  speak through her. This happens most  often in the second section which consists of prose poems. Many of these are  beautiful, tight httle vignettes in which  her eye misses nothing, her voice never  falters.  In "And of Course His Face", Hartog remembers a former partner, not by his face  whose features have faded with time, but by  his boots.  As he worked, the tool pouch that  drooped from his belt would weigh down  his jeans, their cuffs collapsing around  his ankles, more and more belly pudging  out over his belt until, thumbs hooked  in his pant-loops, he gave a little hop—  the tool pouch flopping out with a startled rattle of screwdrivers and pliers—  and there were his boots again.  Descriptive passages like this one, enhanced by Hartog's perceptive eye, are  Hartog's best writing in this collection.  The above vignette appears in a string  of prose poems from "Harry's Dog" to  "A Rosy Aureole", which are undisturbed by the lack of strength and clarity in Hartog's lyric poems.  Another in this string is "A Tool-  shed" in which a toolshed built by  the poet provides a resting place for  Monarch butterflies.  They alight on the sill, the drain  spout, the shingled roof: monosyllabic  blades of wing stuck here and there, a  quiver like thrown knives on the rough  green walls.  There are a few others later in  the second section, like "The Seventh  Tale", about an old man living alone in  the woods, that are also beautiful and  clear.  The old man opened his eyes—to the  first cold morning, his moustache stiff  with frost. This was what it was like  then, to be lost, and waken: your breath  hovering close, solicitous, having found  you.  Hartog has a skiU of transforming a  feeling or scene that is so familiar—the  fading of a well-loved face, the remembering of some unimportant and vivid  detail,  the way things take so much  longer to buUd than you think they're  going to—into something unique and  fascinating, edged with magic. As often, these pieces have hidden in their  finely-drawn details, a touch of the  macabre, a touch of pain, hke a painting  by Hieronymous Bosch. They are, in  effect, encapsulations of what it means  to beLStive, to be human.  I also liked Hartog's indiscriminate leaps  from one tune and place to another, her  Tralfamadorian* style of existing in all parts  of her own chronology.  My disappointment in this collection,  therefore, came not from comparing  Hartog to others but from comparing  her to herself, to her own strengths.  My feeling when I finished reading the  book was that she should have edited it  more severely and put out a coUection  only of the extraordinary pieces, leav  ing aside the unevenly good and not  quite successful pieces until they, too,  could sound as if they had been born  and not constructed.  Hartog would do well to rely more  deeply on her intuitive sense, which  does not fail her, and less on her in-  teUect which often seems to fool her.  Her natural abilities are considerable  enough when left to speak for themselves.  *From Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughter-  House Five. The Tralfamadorians lived  in four dimensions, time being the  fourth, and their chronology had no beginning and no end but always was.

It's a  just-published, first novel by a woman  who is a member of the WhUeaway  Writers' Co-op in California. (WhUeaway is the name of the anarcha-  feminist community in Marge Piercy's  book,  Woman On The Edge of Time,  classic feminist, speculative fiction  novel published in 1974).  In many ways, No Safe Place is  a standard science fiction adventure.  There's a loud-mouthed main character; a dedicated space-pilot who swears  a lot and stands up to the malicious owner of an omnipotent space-  exploration corporation. The difference  is that the hero is a woman, and this  adds interest, not so much to the action but to the development of the characters and their relationships. Kate  Harlen, the space-pUot, is in a vulnerable position for most of the book, and  she reveals her feehngs to the people  around her when she trusts them, particularly when they're women. Kate  cries when she's afraid, she admits feeling insecure about her abUity to cope,  and she allows her friends to comfort  and reassure her. She does aU this without losing stature as a very competent  space pUot.  There's also a sensitive portrayal of  Kate's growing reliance on alcohol to  deal with pressure, and with her strug-  to resist addiction.  WORLttf  There were some stylistic problems  with the book. The author overuses  the technique of characters telling each  other, in lengthy conversations, about  past events in order to inform or remind the reader of significant plot elements. More annoying are the sudden  and awkward switches of the narrator's  voice from Kate's to other characters.  This is a common enough technique,  but when it's not handled smoothly,  the reader is aware that information is  being concealed. What this means is  that Moroz' writing is stUl a little self-  conscious. It's a good book though, in  spite of that.  ■ A Creed for the Third Millennium  by Colleen McCullough  Avon Books, 1985  458 pages, $5.95  I read this book because a friend of  mine, who never reads science fiction,  told me about it. Colleen McCullough  is the author of The Thorn Birds and  other bestseUers, but this is her first science fiction novel. I'm always intrigued  when general fiction writers try then-  hand at science fiction—are they looking for an opportunity to let their imaginations run wilder or do they have a secret idea they've been dying to explore?  McCullough is definitely not interested in an extensive look at the future  in this book. TechnologicaUy, there are  few surprises, and sociaUy, there are  even fewer. People stUl hve in couples  (though there is acceptance of same-sex  relationships), women stUl struggle to  gain and maintain parity with men in  pay and power, and a government job  is stUl good for perks and security.  But the earth has cooled, and there  has been a subsequent migration of in  dustry to warmer climates. The people are forced to foUow capital, much  as workers do today. The locus is the  United States and the population is disconcertingly docile in the face of regimented moves and the institutionalization of the one—child family.  My favourite part of the book is its  early pages where a household copes  with the encroaching ice age by taking  loving care of a living-room fuU of green  and flowering plants, and where one  woman's routine with her hot-water  bottle made me want to get mine out  of the closet.  There are big problems with this  book, which is essentiaUy a reprise of  Auel's recreation of prehistoric humanity with a fabulous woman as its protagonist. In Mary Mackey's book, Inanna  is the heroine who transcends the brutality of her nomadic beginnings to  move into a more sophisticated culture.  But Inanna's adventure is not an exploration of the evolutionary development  of homo sapiens. In fact, the world she  discovers—a matriarchal society rooted  in worship of the Goddess—is on the  verge of destruction.  Along with being fast-paced and exciting, the story aUows for glimpses  of role-reversal that always appeal to  me.       The   men,   excepting   the   no-  the Christ story. One is that it could  have been much shorter, even noveUa-  length. The other problem has to dp  with "the Creed" itself. McCuUough  seems to be saying that survival in  the future wUl involve a religious revival of love and trust amongst people.  Her message is weakened by the central  theme of the plot: power corrupts the  body and the soul, especiaUy when it's  wielded by a cold-blooded, ambitious  woman who is determined to keep her  government job!  I don't recommend this book.  mads, are gentle, warm and respectful of the women, and occupy a clearly  subservient role as servants and sidekicks. At first this is incomprehensible to Inanna, as when a man says, for  example, "In my city, the women belong only" to themselves." But she soon  adapts, even to the point of not noticing the support she receives from tb  men around her.  This is definitely not a women-only  society: in A Warrior Queen, the glorification of heterosexuahty is the primary religious celebration.  ■ The Last Warrior (  by Mary Mackey  Berkly Books, 1983  240 pages, $2.95  It's impossible not  book to Clan of the  1146 Commercial * 253-0913  lueen ■ The Needle on Full  by Caroline Forbes  Onlywomen Press, 1985  267 pages, $7.95  to compare this Most of the stories in this coUection  Cave Bear, Jean look at a future where women are dealing, alternately, with the grim reality of  life after the nuclear holocaust and the  joy of hving with other women.

Nursing was viewed as a female occupation, a career which simply  prepared women for the ultimate goal  of marriage. Female socialization also  perpetuated the myth that aU women  made good nurses and therefore nurses  required minimal training.  Women,   in  general,   accepted this  Janice Kirk, R.N. B.Sc.  This article is in response to the  July/August 86 article, "B.C. Nurses—  A Growing Working Class Consciousness" .  / agree with many of the ideas in that  article, but I also believe that nursing is  a profession, and I'm proud of it.  Does a professional nurse require a  university degree? Do only nurses with  university degrees display the quahties  of professionalism in their work; qualities such as autonomy, responsibility  and pride? Most nurses would answer  no to these questions. At the same  time, many nurses stiU consider a professional to be someone in a position of  authority, and they do not view bedside  nursing as a professional practice.  These beliefs about the professional  status of nursing are partially based  on the historic tendency of university  -prepared nurses to abandon bedside  nursing and seek positions of greater  power in education dr administration.  The traditional hospital staff nurse pjb-  sition did not aopeal to university graduates whose education had prepared  them for an independent, innovative  and nursing-based practice. Instead of  chaUenge and educational stimulation,  they found only stereotyped roles for  nursing which quickly undermined their  sense of professional self-esteem.  Nurses today, in fact, stUl struggle to  maintain pride in their careers within  the confines of stereotyping. They continue to act out the handmaiden role,  they continue to receive less pay than  a grocery cashier, they continue to suppress creative ideas, and they continue  to take needless static from head nurses  and nursing supervisors who live in the  dark ages of nursing. However, although nurses still must cope with these  stereotyped roles, it is no longer true  that university prepared nurses abandon bedside nursing. On the contrary,  even nurses prepared at a doctoral level  now practice in the 'front ranks'. There  is a growing pride in bedside nursing.  As a result of more nurses acting  as professionals in their nursing practice, there is a growing consciousness in  today's society for the appreciation of  nurses as inteUigent, independent and  invaluable practitioners in health care.  Through their personal contact with  nurses and through positive media images of nursing, people are realizing  that nursing is rapidly catching up to  the level of importance presently enjoyed by the other professions. Nursing's impact on society is lower than  that of other professions because the  education of nurses was sabotaged by  the lethal combination of three forces.  The first force to sabotage nursing  education was the power of hospital administrators who used student nurses  as cheap labour. This force caused students to sacrifice their need to explore  nursing theory, since aU of their time  and energy was spent in the physically  taxing work of staffing the hospitals.  The second force to sabotage nursing education was the power of physicians who used nurses jto carry out  medical tasks. The medical profession controlled the nursing curriculums  in hospital-based schools and therefore  hindered the expansion of nursing theory by using their medical model in  planning nursing courses. In addition,  the establishment of independent nursing schools in universities was actively  discouraged by the medical profession.  "Society was informed by medical doc  tors that the 'overtraining' of nurses  was a waste of public funds.  It is through such actions as these  that nurses wiU gain power and improve  their working conditions. Power in  nursing also comes from a growing con-  view of nursing; they were effectively socialized into being passive  and dependent personahties who lacked  long-term career goals. In truth, most  nurses spent the majority of their adult  years away from nursing practice.

I  apologize to Jewish lesbians who were excluded by this mistake.  I would however have preferred that you  had delivered the criticism to me before going public. That way I would have had an  opportunity to reply.  First, this would have given you more information so you could have avoided the  mistakes of not addressing the criticisms to  the Network and of giving Dykes for Dykedom credit for my work. Second, after being  given this information, had you then chosen to go public, I would have been given a  voice to reply in the same issue of Kinesis  instead of being silenced.  I appreciate you as white women attending the "Unlearning Racism" workshop. As  a woman of colour actively fighting against  racism, it is important to me that you support me and other women of colour also actively fighting against racism.  am organizing an evaluation of the  workshop in December. Lesbians who attended wiU be contacted.  Celeste George  Kinesis  Dykes for Dykedom, as part of the Lesbian Network, accepts the criticism delivered by Jo Morrison and Shelagh Wilson  and recognizes the Network's mistake in  scheduling events during Rosh Hashanah,  the Jewish New Year. We apologize to Jewish lesbians who could not participate because of our error.  We want to clarify that Dykes for Dykedom did not organize the "Unlearning  Racism" workshop and therefore do not  want to be given credit for Celeste's work.  We decided as a group to do work in support of Celeste and the workshop, but we  did not organize it.  We sould have appreciated that the criticism be addressed to the Lesbian Network  since it was the Network that was making  aU decisions on the events during International Lesbian Week.  We would have also appreciated that we  be contacted previous to the going pub-  he with the criticism, to give us a chance  to address it, which could have been more  supportive of us as white lesbians working  against racism. This would have given us the  opportunity to chaUenge you on why it was  important for you as white womyn to meet  with Celeste to address the criticism to her  before going public with it.  Dykes for Dykedom  Kinesis  We, as the Lesbian Network who organized International Lesbian Week, accept  and agree with the criticism from Jo Morrison and Shelagh WUson regarding the  Lesbian Network's mistake in scheduling a  workshop on Rosh Hashanah—the Jewish  New Year.  We are sorry that our mistake excluded  Jewish lesbians from attending the "Unlearning Racism" workshop. The network  received this same criticism from another  Jewish woman at the end of September. At  that time we responded with a letter accepting the criticism, apologizing for our mistake and making a commitment to be aware  of all cultural holidays so that we can take  them into account when we schedule events.  We did not give this letter wide enough distribution, for example publishing it in Kinesis.

For myself, just as I believe men  do not have a right to judge how  women struggle for equality, I believe that women of one country—  particularly a rick, industrialized, 'first  world' country—^do not have a moral  right to assign a grade or report card to  the struggle of women in other societies.
