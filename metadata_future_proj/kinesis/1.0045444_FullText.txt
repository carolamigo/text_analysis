Fourth Ave.  736-3748-7-8  Volume IV   No. 30  Romance - absurdity, untruth/ fable,  lie  Speaking about that branch of romance that  deals with the sentimental and usually  sexual feeling or relationship between  two people, hardly anyone, it seems, has  a good word to say for it - at least,  hardly anyone who has had some extended  experience with it. Romance has a very  bad reputation, in fact; people tend to  sneer at it, disparage it, make cynical  remarks about it, laugh at it and treat  it with bitter contempt, as if, like a  worthless lover, it has treated them  badly - which, as everyone knows, it has.  Yet the fascination with and the yearning  for romance persists, in spite of the  general understanding that it is a fool's  game. The airways are alive with the ebb  and throb of romance, the movies make the  most of it, it's always cropping up in  books, magazines, advertisements (it isn't  only sex that sells - it's romance too),  conversations, psychiatrist's offices -  nearly wherever one cares to look. And  most people continue to search for romance,  however furtively, for most of their  lives, that is no secret.  What is one to make of such a contradiction? All the dire warnings and doom-  sayings from all the preachers, priests,  parents, friends, advice columnists and  other moralists has not dimmed the interest in romance, and all the bitter personal experience (the personal experience  of many generations, it may be added,  much of it recorded for those who come  after, in the form of journals, autobiographies, philosophies, novels, diaries,  sermons, etc.) has not slaked the thirst  for it.  Is it possible that humanity is  by nature just hopelessly perverse, as  we have so often been told - or is that  explanation in itself, like so many other  glib and gloomy pronouncements on "the  nature of things", just another romance  (lie)?  If one ponders it, though, it would seem  that there is something which is even  more unpopular than romance, that being  love.  It's true that they are often used  synonmously, but the fact that they are  used interchangeably is interesting in  itself, since romance has always been  defined as a lie or an illusion, and love  is supposed to have something to do with  truth.  Fantasizing about such thorny  matters (why not?), is it possible that  over the centuries love has been stripped  of its original powers, and now appears  a poor, ragged, half demented and pitiful shadow of its former self (or its  potential self), now dubbed romance? Is  it possible that something like what has  happened to women has happened to love as  well?  If something of that nature has  occurred, maybe love has been brought so  low because it is too scarey; because  romance, however bitterly it disappoints  how many people over and over again, is  still preferable in this best of all  possible worlds, because it is less real,  less frightening and more safe than love.  People raised in this society have a  tendency to like being safe and sorry.  If the yearning for love could not and  cannot be removed from the human heart  altogether, maybe it has been instead  effectively disarmed, turned into an  absurdity and trotted out as romance.  It's possible that love, like art, poses  a profound threat to any political system or state (any traditional - including contemporary - or historical state,  which means any state system spawned out  of patriarchial conditions).  As we make  our rocky way into the new dispensation  it might be to our advantage to remember  that the official religion of the west -  Christianity - is (supposedly) based on  the teachings of a person who was crucified for preaching a doctrine of love -  not romance, but love.  Such a message  caused the powers that be to react rather  nervously, to say the least; had Christ  taught romance he probably wouldn't have  caused so much as a ripple of consternation.  But what is love, anyway? Who knows, who  can tell at this juncture? It's like  another beautiful and vague word that  the human race stubbornly refuses to  give up - I mean freedom; its meaning  and its power has been all but forgotten,  at least consciously.  But maybe as we  begin to break the lies that bind we will  find it again.  - Ruth Calder  Romance 2  Volunteers      Education  T£§B§i£ion_House needs volunteers to help  with childcare, especially on weekends  and to help with transportation daily.

The Honourable John Munro, Minister  Responsible for the Status of Women  told the members that the government  will be proposing legislation to  establish a Commission for the establishment of Egalitarian Rights.  This  legislation would incorporate principles originally developed for Bill C-  206 to amend the Canada Labour Code  to include sex, age, and marital  status as prohibited grounds for discrimination.  There is presently no  law which protects employees of businesses under federal charters (air  lines, banks, telephone companies,  to name a few) from discrimination on  the basis of sex.  Delays already experienced in eliminating inequities under the Labour Code,  Citizenship Act and Canada Pensions  Act caused members to express concern.  If the scope of the commission is to  be too broad, it may be unable to deal  effectively with discrimination.  Therefore, the Advisory Council proposes that "the introduction of Human  Rights Legislation should be accompanied at the same time by specific  amendments to existing legislation  where inequalities and discrimination  exist.  Canada Pension  Plan  Several members of the Advisory Council Executive Committee met in December  with Hon. Marc Lalonde, Minister of  National Health and Welfare to discuss  inequities in the Canada Pension Plan.  Mr, Lalonde indicated at that time,  that a discussion of inequities of  the plan would be scheduled for the  upcoming meeting of the Federal and  Provincial Welfare Ministers.  In  addition, a meeting has been arranged  late in February, with DNHW officials  studying the feasibility of including  housewives in the Canada Pension Plan.  Provisions should be made in the Human  Rights Commission legislation enabling  class action and supporting affirmative action by governments.  The  protection for the individual should  be assured through providing for the  submission of anonymous complaints.  Appeal of decisions made by the Human  Rights Commission should exist and be  clearly defined.  The Advisory Council feels that the  introduction of Human Rights legislation should be accompanied at the same  time by specific amendments to existing legislation where inequalities  and discrimination exist i.e.  Canada Labour Code, Canada Pension  Plan, Citizenship Act, Immigration Act,  equal employment, benefits and opportunities, etc., etc.  The Human Rights Commission should  consist of an uneven number of appointees, not necessarily lawyers,  and no less than five.  These appointees should realistically represent  the male-female population distribution  in Canada.  The proposed legislation for a Human  Rights Commission will be studied by  the Advisory Council immediately after  first reading by the House of Commons.  Following this, members of the Council  will meet with the Parliamentary Committee studying the Bill.  While the jurisdiction of a Human  Rights Commission will specifically  relate to areas of federal responsibility, strong federal legislation  will assure an example for provincial  governments, private industry and  individual citizens.  16 January 1974  Toronto, Ontario  Ombuds  ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE STATUS OF  WOMEN  STATEMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION  The Advisory Council on the Status, of  Women commends the Government of  Canada for its announced intention to  establish a Human Rights Commission.  Legislation to establish this Commission should be introduced as early as  possible in the next session of  Parliament opening on 26 February 1974.  The terms of reference and powers  should be precise, firm and enforceable  to avoid the pitfalls in applying the  Canadian Bill of Rights.  The Human  Rights Commission should have powers  to prosecute, impose fines, issue injunctions, order payment of damages,  hear complaints dealing with legislation which prohibits discrimination,  investigate suspected cases of discrimination and act as a regulatory  body.  It should report directly to  Parliament.  OMBUDS NEWS IN BRIEF  We've all been working like mad on recommendations to various working committees  of the Royal Commission on Family and  Children's Law something which at  present involves about four different  meetings a week.  About time there is some reform in this  area since an increasing number of calls  lately have been from women experiencing  difficulty in family court, with maintenance, custody, property and so on.  Three women from Eaton's laid complaints  against the company regarding equal pay.  It's now under investigation.  The Y.W.C.A. and us are jointly involved  with a L.I.P. project dealing with the  problems of immigrant women in the labour  force. Staff were hired from the ethnic  community with Liz Fortes as coordinator,  Ann Chan, Mary Chan, and Liliane Karnouk  as workers. 4  St. Valentine  St. Valentine was not romantic.  He was  not a lover, a husband or a boyfriend.  Before he became a saint, Valentine was  a priest who was sentenced to death by  the Emperor Claudius for helping Christian martyrs.  While chained in his cell  awaiting execution Valentine, never one  to waste time, converted his gaoler, for  which he was beaten with wooden clubs  before being beheaded.  A noble, dedicated self-sacrificing man certainly -  but'it would be difficult to classify  him as a romantic.  How then did his name become synonymous  with joy (spell that $$$)   to candy and  greeting card manufacturers all over the  western world? Why have generations of  young girls prayed to him to send them  husbands?  (Unless, of course, they are  eager to share his martyrdom).  Does  "Be My Valentine" constitute an endearing invitation when it is translated as  "Be My Third Century Christian priest  who was beaten with wooden clubs and  beheaded"? How did all this come about?  Well, to unravel this question we have  to follow a thread all the way back to  753 B.C. when Romulus and Remus, the  founders of Rome, were suckled by a she-  wolf.  A yearly festival evolved on February 15 to celebrate this event and was  named the Festival of Lupercalia in honour of the wolf, (lupus being Latin for  wolf) or the fertility god Lupercus,  depending on which book you believe.  Anyway priests, called Luperci, went to  the cave on the Palatine Hill where R  and R had lived with the wolf and there  they sacrificed goats and a dog (symbols  of fertility) and smeared the blood on  the faces of two young nobles who had  volunteered for the honour.  The goats  and dog presumably were not volunteers.  The blood was then wiped off with wool  dipped in milk.  The priests proceeded  to feast on the flesh and use the skins  to clothe themselves and make long whips.  The Luperci then ran through the streets  of Rome lashing everyone that they encountered.  Throngs of men and women  joined in the mad race, pushing as near  to the priests as possible, for to be  whipped was to be cleansed of all sins.  Women were particularly eager to receive  the painful, cutting lashes for it was  promised that any woman who was whipped  during the Festival of Lupercalia would  become a mother before the year was over.  This was a very desirable condition   unless of course you were unmarried. Perhaps the Festival performed a service in  that case too, by providing an explanation for unexplainable pregnancies ("Well  of course I don't know how it could have  happened!  ...except if you'll remember  I was whipped by the Luperci last February. ...").  If this still does not strike you as  being very romantic, don't give up. There  is another thread woven in with this one.  The festival day was also dedicated to  Pan, the god of nature and fertility and  herds, and Juno, the goddess of women  and marriage.  On the eve of the Festival,  (February 14), young women drew slips of  parchment bearing the names of young men  who would be their partners during the  Festival.  Is it becoming more familiar?  Well, it's not quite that simple.  We  still have to fit St. Valentine into the  picture.  When Christianity was established as the  reigning mythology in Rome, the Church  tried to make the conversion a little  less jarring for the people by adopting  some of the old pagan festivals in a  very modified form.  The feast of Lupercalia was very popular and the Church  leaders viewed the ceremony of drawing  names as harmless, but they did frown on  the practice of men dressed solely in  untanned goatskins running through the  streets whipping people.  They preferred  that the Church be in charge of purification.  So that part was out.  They even  changed the names on the parchment slips  from those of prospective lovers to those  of saints whose virtues the young girls  were supposed to emulate during the  coming year.  Obviously the holy day  could no longer be named after either a  wolf or a fertility god and so it was  renamed in honour of a Christian saint  who had been martyred in Rome in February  of 269 A.D.  Right:  St. Valentine!  Many people felt that most ot tne pazazz  had been taken out of the holiday. An  old pagan would never have recognized it.  The practice of acting like a saint for  an entire year never really caught on  either.  However, the ceremony of drawing names  on February 14, was kept up and gradually the names once again became those  of prospective girl or boyfriends. Customs and superstitions developed to  accompany the ceremony.  In the upper  class English circles of Samuel Pepys'  day elaborate gifts, ranging from fine  leather gloves to precious gems, were  presented to the woman whose name was  drawn.  The poets claimed that birds  chose their mates on St. Valentine's  Day.  And one old wives' tale had it that  if you pinned five bayleaves to your pillow, boiled an egg and replaced the yolk  with salt and then ate the egg, shell and  all, you would see your future husband's  face in a dream.  If you could ever get  to sleep after that!  Probably St. Valentine and the Luperci  would be united in their bewilderment  over the rites that are performed on  February 14.  They both seem too vigorous and straightforward (in their separate ways) to be associated with heart  shaped boxes of gooey marchino cherry  chocolates and verses like:  "If you will be my Valentine  And evermore be Mine  I will love you True  And nevermore be Blue."  It almost makes you long for a good  goat-hide whip.  - Jo Lazenby Midterm Deport  5  When I accepted the nomination for president last June, one of the reasons was  that I thought that I could set up some  of the conditions that would result in  some changes in the structure of operations that would solve some of the  chronic problems in our office.  These  changes have now been made.  On the whole  the changes have worked out well, but  the process brought some negative  results too.  The first of these negative results is  that I neglected, or perhaps was incapable of fully explaining to anyone what  was really going on, leaving some of you  feeling uncertain and immobilized.  I  will now try to explain the problem and  the changes, and if you don't understand  please say so.  One of our first major  decisions was that an ombudsservice  should be an important part of what we  do.  Our first grant was a no strings  attached grant for this purpose from  the Secretary of State.  Rosemary Brown  used it most effectively and set a very  high standard for the ombudsservice.  Our second, much larger grant was a LIP  grant. These grants are given for specific projects.  They come with rules  which are designed to get the project  done efficiently but which tend to make  the office unresponsive to outside needs.  It is therefore not surprising that  members, executive and members of the  general public from time to time found  staff too busy or preoccupied.  Our problems were intensified by the  late approval of our second LIP grant -  after we had given up half of our office  space.  After the approval we could not  rent adjacent office space and funds  were not guaranteed ahead for long  enough to make a move.  We solved our  problem by having most of our 19 member  staff working outside of the office.  In the process the ombudsservice staff,  who answered the phones, found themselves  more and more being the servants of the  rest of the staff, instead of being able  to do follow up work on the sort of major*  problems that Rosemary had dealt with.  The first change that we tried was to  have the education group work on the  ombudsservice for a while.  This helped  to produce more understanding in the  office but didn't help with getting the  Women's Studies Course done.  Next we  introduced a duty day system where  everyone took a turn on the phones and  then did their own work on other days.  This worked a little better in the old  office and very well in the new office.  It was Roberta who made this suggestion,  thanks Robertal  The biggest change came about when the  B.C. government gave us long term, no  strings attached funding that enabled us  to move.  I want to give special thanks  to Kathy and Glinda for their help with  this big job.  About this time, we  assigned Pam to phoning the membership  ' to get those who were interested in  helping us with our work involved.  There  were some complaints that too few people  made that decision but the complaints  came from those who knew about the  meeting and did not come.  More signifi  cantly these people did not want her to  stop.  As a result of Pam's activity  we now have a number of membership projects, many of them with one or two  members of the staff or executive providing specialized help.  Pam has  encouraged members who do not have  specific interests to come into the  office to help answer phones.  This has  worked well for helping to develop  special interests.  Two of these volunteers now work at Transition House.  Members seem to like answering phones  and staff also likes to be relieved of  routine calls for two or three hours a  day.  It doesn't take long to learn how  to handle 90% of the phone calls.  The final change came in eliminating the  position of office co-ordinator. This  is still seen as a power position and  as in most organizations information is  withheld from power positions.  It is  vital to have communication going in all  directions in a responsive and creative  working group.  Yes, I think we have  achieved this now.  The second negative result was a deterioration of my physical and mental health.  As a result, my personal priorities have  changed.  Instead of the organization  first, I now plan to put my health first.  I hope to become physically fit for the  first time in my life, perhaps lose a  little weight, finish a thesis and do  other things that will help me find a job  in continuing education next fall.  Meantime, I hope you will find a more  relaxed president friendlier, and that  more of you will be able to help our  reduced staff to carry on their work.  A DOLL'S HOUSE by Henrik Ibsen  February 11 - March 2 at the Q.E. Playhouse produced by the Playhouse Theatre  Centre of B.C.  artistic director,  Bill Glassco of Taraggon Theatre Co. in  Toronto.  In this intense emotional drama Ibsen  shows how men and women may be lulled  into living together without looking  into themselves or each other.  With  Nora's final action the slamming of their  front door she becomes the first feminist  in dramatic literature.  Clive Barnes of  the New York Times said of Ibsen that he  was a playwright of passion.  Carolyn Diakun 6  Films  FROM A FEMINIST VIEWPOINT  Introduction:  Who reads movie reviews?  I do.  My reasons for doing  so vary from reviewer to reviewer.  Quite often I do so simply to disagree with one particular reviewer.  Trite, yes, but the film industry  portrays a point of view.  As such,  it carries the same kind of influence as any other means of communicating values.  Therefore, there Is  a need to monitor this form of com-  - munication as there is for any other  — not necessarily feminist movies,  but all movies from a feminist viewpoint.  Movies have influence and  it is up to us ("us" including  everyone aware and involved in the  women's movement) to put this influence in it's proper perspective.\  For myself, I have never attempted  to review anything in my life.  Who  knows, I may even promise never to  do it again.  For now, I can only  be relieved that there is no need to  get into the technicalities of the  art of movie making.  Viewing and  brevity in saying what I see is much  more to my tastes.  I hope it is als  to yours.  Movie:  THE HOMECOMING  "I've been begging my (two) sons  to find the right girl...a feminine girl...with the proper credentials".  So saith the father  of a household of men.  He doesn't  go on to say outright what kind  of credentials.  At any rate, it  is a household that is made up  of ineffectual, mouthy father,  two sons; one a part-time boxer,  the other a pimp, and an uncle,  the Tro ther of the father.  Enter the third, the eldest and  supposedly most succesful of  the sons with his wife his  wife of nine years and whose  existence is completely unknown  to the rest of the family.  Being  a stranger, she is greeted as  a tart.  How nice, and there's  more.  Up to her arrival in the  house, the uncle was the only  one who seemed to try to put  any resemblence of neatness in  the house and he's made up to  be effeminate.  Other than that, the  setting was designed to appear slipshod a characteristic supposedly  befitting an all-male atmosphere.  Mugs were used before the woman's  entry; cups and saucers were used  after. That's a small detail but  it leads on to what happens later.  The men acknowledge her presence  and progressively reveal their attitudes towards women in general.  Situation:  an all-male, working  class household.  Once they become  accustomed to a woman in their  domain, her presence and use is  put up for discussion.  They find  they like her so much they would  like to keep her.  The question  is how.  It wasn't left up to her  to decide and, if anyone is wondering, it wasn't up to her husband either.  His only comment  seemed to be, "...it isn't within my field" - he is a doctor of  philosophy.  To make things short,  the general concensus was for her  to have a flat elsewhere in town  from where she could sell her  body at nights to earn her keep,  but"not out all night...maybe she  could do some of the housework  (in the household, her home)  during the day".  Only trouble is  that, once informed of her position, she shows she has some kind  of mind.  She does not object,  she merely starts to state some  of her requirements if she decides  to go along with their plans.  It,  isn't until then that she is heard  and they all too readily agree and  begin to fall all over her.  At  that point, it's a toss-up wnether  the situation is pathetic or comical.  Her line is, "perhaps it's  the fact that my lips are moving and  not what I'm saying that attracts  your attention".  Spoken by her, that  pretty well sums up the movie.  Male  versus male versus female.  Somebody disturbed the pecking order  of the house.  You really have to  see it to believe it.  Too bad it's  true.  NOTE:  This movie was one of eight  scheduled by the American Film Theatre.  The movies are plays placed  in the movie format.  As I understand, these plays will be shown a-  gain although slightly altered to  adapt better from a stage to a  film.  M.

Letters  7  Dear Editor,   I wish to bring to your  attention that someone should file suit  against our Provincial Government for  false advertising, and misleading the  public at large.  My referral is the booklet "SOCIAL  ASSISTANCE HANDBOOK", published June 1,  1973.  You will note their portrayal is  a "together" unit strolling on the beach.  I ask you, is this "SOCIAL WELFARE".  The true image is not portrayed by this  pictorial.  Rather it would be more  representative to portray a "woman"  dragging a couple of children through  second hand stores trying to buy some  cheap clothing, or the other side of  the coin, a broken family unit in a  small apartment with beer bottles all  about.  If the feature picture is typical of  the Welfare status I better change my  attitude, as I don't have time to walk  on the beach, I have to work my "ass"  off to support two families.

A new Human Rights  Commission has been  appointed under the new statute.     Two of  the   five  commissioners  are women Rose  Charlie of  the B.C.   Indian Homemakers  Association,   and Gene Errington a step  forward from the  "token woman"   syndrome.  Under the new statute the  commission has  the  task of educating and informing people of their rights  and of generally  oringing human rights  issues before  the  public.     The  commission is  also expected  to identify problems,   and will be  contacting private  citizens  and community  groups,   particularly outside the metropolitan area to  find out what is going on.  Anybody with any thoughts,   ideas,   facts,  suggestions  about human rights  and how  to make people aware of them can write  or call Gene or Rose,   or write directly  to  Bishop  Remi  DeRoo,   Chairperson of  the  Human Rights  Commission,   Department of  Labour,  Victoria.  Woman A live ,   the  TVs  series  sponsored  by the Status   of  Women  is  now well   into  its  second series.     The  first,  from September to December 1973*  varied   its   programming from historical  accounts   of  B.C.   women to  the   present Transition House.  These  were   produced  by Ann  Petrie ,  who   initially arranged  our programme  with  Channel  10.  In January,   our cameras  went  to the   Native Women's Conference.     Two programmes  concerned   legal  rights and another,  the  thoughts  of  young  women.  The February and March  programming will  be  as  follows:  Feb.   7 Unions  l4 Women's Theatre Co-op.  21   Native Women  28 Western Conference:  Employment and Education  March 7 Alternative  Occupations  14 Family Court  21   Middle-Age  Women  28 The Vancouver Status  of  Women  We  still  need  volunteers   to  help  us  continue  the  programme  into the   summer.     Those   interested  please  contact Glinda  at 733-37^6.
