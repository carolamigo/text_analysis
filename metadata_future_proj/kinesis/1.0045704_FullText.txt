Shell and its South African subsidiaries  supply fuel to the South African police  and military and to the apartheid economy.  Without fuel from companies like Shell, the  apartheid government could not enforce its  system of segregation, slave labour and terror. Shell has refused to stop oil supplies to  South Africa, saying "that would constitute  interference in the internal affairs of that  country...*  Until Royal Dutch/Schell withdraws from  South Africa don't buy Shell products.  Some examples include gasoline products  such as Shell diesoline, motor oils such as  Aeroshell, Rimula, Rotella and Super Shell  TLO. Other Shell products include: Automotive and home products such as Super-  shell Snowshoe (tires), Shell Superlife (batteries) and air fresheners and roofing supplies. Shell credit cards should be cut up and  returned with a letter protesting Shell involvement in South Africa to: Shell Canada  Ltd, Box 7000, North York, Ontario, M3C  9Z9.

Goodnight  Noreen  After three years, Noreen Shanahan (regular readers may know her better as Noreen  Howes) is leaving her position as Kinesis  typist and word processor.  Noreen has been a stellar performer at  the keyboard, coping with testy editors,  frustrated production co-ordinators, illegible writers and all the volunteers, both new  and old, who need help, advice and support  as well as directions to the coffee pot.  Noreen will maintain her roles as Kinesis  reporter extraordinaire and Editorial Board  member. Hopefully, she will also maintain  her ongoing responsibility for providing the  newest in country and western tunes for the  production cowgals.  KINESIS ///////////////////^^^^^  /////////////////////^^^^  news  In the face of growing divisions among politicians at all levels  of government, pro-choice groups  and their allies are arguing that  Canada is better off without an  abortion law.  Meanwhile, federal Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn announced  in mid-March that despite a lack  of consensus among governments,  Ottawa will press ahead with a  new national abortion law.  The federal government is reported to be considering a policy  that would allow freedom of choice  up to 16 weeks of pregnancy but  restrict or prohibit abortions after  that point.  A broad range of groups, including the National Action Council on  the Status of Women, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Canadian Abortion Ac-  tion Rights League and many oth  Pro choice  No limit on abortion acceptable  by Delores Fitzgerald  ers, say a law restricting abortions based on the gestational period would create undue delays  and hardship for many women.  According to Norma Scarborough, abortion league president,  "A limit would not take into account ... 12 or 13 year olds who  do not have established menstrual  cycles and at 12 weeks (gestation)  might not even be aware they are  pregnant."  The 16 week limit also does not  take into account the situation of  women undergoing genetic testing,  such as amniocentesis. The test for  serious fetal "defects" cannot be  done until the 19th week of pregnancy, with results not expected  for several weeks after.  Pro-choice groups say that the  abortion issue has been derailed  into a debate on fetal development by anti-abortionists who imply that women are irresponsible  and will have more late term abortions.  According to Jackie Ainsworth,  spokesperson for the British Columbia Coalition for Abortion Clinics (BCCAC), "The women of  this country do not need to be  threatened by criminal sanctions.  Women are responsible moral  agents. In the past we never had  limits based on gestation, the decision was always between a woman  and her doctor as to the best approach.  "The focus on gestation is really  just an attempt to whittle away at  the Supreme Court decision. It's  an effort to cater to an anti-choice  perspective."  In other developments, feminists continue to call on federal  Health Minister Jake Epp to use  his power to ensure that women  have equal access to abortion.  Judith Allen, spokesperson for  the National Association of Women  and the Law, told an Ontario press  conference that "The federal government has a coercive power with  y#i  British Columbians working in solidarity with Nicaragua demonstrated in late March against the  United States government's recent decision to base 3.200 troops in Honduras. Demonstrations such  as this one have played an important role in limiting Americian intervention in Central America.  As we go to press the Sandinista government has reached a ceasefire agreement with the U.S.  - backed contra forces. The ceasefire marks the first real hope for peace in Nicaragua since the  conflict began in 1981. Over 50,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed in the war.  the withholding of transfer payments and we want them to use  that power.  "We would like to see Mr. Epp  start default proceedings against  those provinces which are not fulfilling the criteria of comprehensive, universal accessibility for the  funding of abortions."  In other abortion news:  British Columbia: The recent  B.C. budget has set aside an estimated $20 million to provide funding for a range of services described as options to abortion. The  list is rumored to include homes  for unwed mothers, marriage promotion and counselling and expanded adoption services. There is  no funding for birth control counselling or services. After suffering an embarrassing loss in the  B.C. Supreme Court on its right to  restrict abortion funding the Social Credit government of William  Vander Zalm has backed down  from a promise to block abortion  access.  Alberta: The province's Progressive Conservative government  has said that women who don't  get at least two doctors to approve an abortion won't have the  procedure covered by medicare.  Hospitals which don't follow the  ruling could lose up to $500 a  day. Three rural Alberta hospitals  are still operating with therapeutic abortion committees. According to constitutional law experts,  Alberta's policy is open to a court  challenge.  Saskatchewan: A coalition of  groups is considering a legal challenge to the province's abortion  policy which says that Saskatchewan will only pay for abortion  in medically necessary or life-  threatening situations, and only  after consultation by two doctors.  Progressive Conservative Premier  Grant   Devine   says   the   recent  Please see Abortion pg 4  Controversy dogs  Meech Lake  Gays and Lesbians  Groups resist growing violence  by Esther Shannon  The Vancouver Lesbian Connection (VLC) is offering aid and  support to lesbian victims of violence in an effort to deal with  a dramatic increase in violent attacks against lesbians and gays in  Vancouver.  Along with the Vancouver Gay  and Lesbian Community Centre  (VGLCC), the VLC is urging gay  people in Vancouver to report violent incidents so cases of homophobic inspired violence can be documented and resisted.  At a recent meeting, which  brought together representatives  of gay and lesbian organizations  and gay businesses as well as individuals, participants decided to  place advertisements in community papers urging people who  have suffered attacks to come forward and report the incident to  -he police and gay organizations.  The meeting postponed decisions on a number of other op  tions including establishing escort  services, presenting a public forum  on violence against gays and lesbians, holding demonstrations and  instituting street patrols in some  neighborhoods. Such suggestions  will continue to be discussed at future meetings.  According to VLC spokesperson  Maureen Mills, "The VLC position  is that violent attacks against gays  and lesbians are on the increase."  Mills cited figures compiled  from police and other reports over  the past few months that showed  at least 12 recent physical attacks on individuals, including two  against lesbians, two bombings,  five bomb threats against gay businesses and organizations and numerous threatening phone calls to  both gay and lesbian organizations  as well as to the homes of individuals with a public gay or lesbian  profile.  "Obviously, the political climate  is that it is not O.K. to be gay or  lesbian," said Mills. "Where there  is so much emphasis on promoting pro-family values, gays and lesbians are seen as a threat and become a vulnerable group."  According to Mills, B.C. Premier William Vander Zalm is  partly responsible for increased  anti-gay and lesbian attitudes.  "Vander Zalm's philosophy is  to invite people to be more vocal  against gays and lesbians. He has  taken a leadership role."  Vander Zalm recently publicly  agreed with Saskatchewan Premier  Grant Devine's appraisal of gay  people as no better than bank robbers.  Mills cited a number of reasons  why gays and lesbians do not readily report violent incidents.  "Sometimes people are unclear  as to why they are attacked—  whether it actually is because they  are gay or lesbian. Also for many  there is a great fear of disclosure,  of coming out if they go to the po-  Please see Violence pg 4  by Kinesis Staff Writer  Controversy continues to build  around the Meech Lake Accord as  an apparently continuous stream  of groups and individuals come up  with concerns about the accord's  provisions.  Most   recently   the   Manitoba  election campaign has given hope  to feminists, and others, that a  new provincial government there  could refuse to ratify the accord as  : it presently stands,  j      Politicians from all parties have  '■> spoken   out   against   the   accord  i saying  that  it  is fundamentally  1 flawed. The Progressive Conserva-  ? tives, who are touted to win the  5 April election, are divided over the  3, issue as are the New Democrats,  who prior to their downfall, were  prepared  to  swallow   their  concerns and ratify the accord. There  are growing doubts that the New  Democrats will regain power in  Manitoba.  Meanwhile provincial Liberal  leader Sharon Carstairs, whose  party continues to make dramatic  gains in public opinion polls, is  on record as opposing the accord because it does not guarantee  women's equality. Carstairs may  hold the balance of power in Manitoba if the Liberals continue to  make gains in the election campaign.  In New Brunswick, Premier  Frank McKenna continues to hold  out against pressure from the federal government to ratify the accord. A recent proposal from the  Quebec government to break the  impasse by calling for a side agreement to expand and make more  precise the agenda for the next  round of constitutional talks (following the ratification of Meech  Lake) may provide a way to resolve  McKenna's concerns.  According to a Quebec government spokesperson such an agreement could meet McKenna's concerns about the rights of women,  francophones outside Quebec and  Senate reform.  The New Brunswick government expressed interest in the proposal, hailing it as evidence that  it is possible to make compromises  on the issue. New Brunswick is  committed to holding public meetings on the accord before it makes  any decision regarding ratification.  In a variety of other forums opposition to the accord continues to  mount. Submissions before a committee of the Ontario legislature  and a Senate committee have provided important forums for critics of the accord. In Nova Scotia,  Premier John Buchanan told the  legislature that if the Liberal opposition continues to stall debate  on the agreement he may wait until 1990 to ratify it. Such a move  would postpone ratification until  after the next provincial election  and endanger the accord further.  To date, only Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Commons  have ratified the accord, reached  last June by the ten provincial premiers and Prime Minister Brian  Mulroney. The other provinces  have until 1990 to do so.  Many anglophone women's groups oppose the accord arguing  that the clause in the accord which  recognizes Quebec as a distinct society could be used to override  rights guaranteed in the Charter  of Rights and Freedoms. Women's  groups, along with many other sectors of Canadian society, are also  concerned that the accord section  on spending powers would allow  provinces to opt out of national social programs such as childcare.  Other criticisms of the accord  include rejection of proposals for  appointing senators and concerns  about an amending process that  would require unanimous consent  of the provinces in many areas, including the creation of new  provinces. Native groups are also  deeply concerned about the exclusion of aboriginal rights from parts  of the accord.  KINESIS ACROSS  B.C.  ^^i^^^^  N^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  lice. Also, people are afraid of retaliation.  "Also, a man or a woman may  go to the police to report an attack  and have a bad experience with the  police and word goes around the  community that the police are not  supportive and people won't go."  The VLC and the VGLCC have  distributed a flyer in the community urging gays and lesbians to report any attacks. Both organizations are willing to provide assistance to any individual who needs  help including accompaniment to  the police if the person wants to  report an assault, peer counselling  and third party reports. (Reports  made to the authorities on behalf  of an individual unwilling to make  a first person report. Such reporting can provide police with valuable information that may assist in  arrests.)  Mills suggests that women who  are concerned about their personal  safety should "...remember the babe alert and aware and try not  to appear vulnerable. We are not  advising people to go back to the  closet."

Manitoba: Anti-choice forces  have vowed to make abortion an  issue in the Manitoba provincial  election campaign which sees voters go to the polls on April 26.  Progressive Conservative leader  Gary Filmon, who initially said he  would close Doctor Henry Morgentaler's Winnipeg clinic if elected  premier, has backed down from  that position and now says his  party's action on abortion services  will depend on the new federal legislation.  The Morgentaler clinic was recently re-licensed by the Manitoba  College of Physicians and Surgeons and is awaiting skilled doctors before re-opening. The Manitoba New Democrats support a  pro-choice position on abortion.  Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs is  advocating counselling on alternatives to abortions but if abortions  must be performed contraceptive  and reproductive counselling must  be provided.  The British Columbia Coalition for Abortion Clinics will  open a clinic in Vancouver as  soon as possible. Staffing is virtually complete and the focus  now is on finding an appropriate location and continuing to  fundraise.

V5N 5L4 or call  876-9920  Dawn conference builds deep bonds  by Eunice Brooks  The Disabled Women's Network's (DAWN) third annual  conference was held at Camp  Squamish in March. The theme  was Violence Against Disabled  Women and the conference attracted over 100 women from all  over British Columbia. Sponsored  by the B.C. chapter of DAWN,  the conference was funded by the  Secretary of State Women's Program and the Office of the Attorney General.  The conference's keynote address was by Joanne Doucette  of Toronto DAWN, on "Violence  Against Women: The Double Vulnerability." Joanne made it clear  that it takes two things to create  a violent act. She said women who  are both isolated and helpless are  always victims. Networking with  others is a protection.  Linda Spies, of Denver, asked  the question on all our minds:  "Why should we have to fight for  equality, when it is ours already?"  But, she admitted that disabled  women she meets through Project  Challenge in Colorado are in the  same bind of low income, lack of  accessible housing, no jobs, and  inadequate transportation. In fact  Project Challenge, now five years  old, has the same aims as DAWN  BC. They lobby for accessibility to  the mainstream just as we do.  In one of four workshops,  Frances Gordon, Crown Counsel and LEAF Vice-President,  explained about precedent setting cases taken on in behalf of  women's rights under the Charter  of Rights. Cases in which a woman  is doubly disadvantaged have priority with LEAF, for instance sex  ual discrimination mixed with race  or disability.  Comments from the workshops  on the law, defensive living, self-  image, music therapy, and the  special one for the DAWN children must remain confidential.  Some mention of an identifying  story would possibly endanger the  woman who came to DAWN in  trust. All DAWN meetings are safe  places now; that policy was ratified.  In fact it says on the application form that DAWN B.C. supports the right of all disabled  women in B.C. & Yukon including but not limited to, women  of colour, lesbian women, parents, native women, and immigrant women. DAWN is a network  where each knot is equal, and the  strings that bind us are strong.  Women had to make choices  about which workshop to take in,  because funding was cut this year,  and so was time. On hand were  reps from the two main funding bodies, to mingle with participants, and to learn first hand what  disabled women need. Money is  the answer. The governments must  commit themselves to equal opportunity. Women who have not taken^  an interest in politics have now  vowed to unite to get their due.  The disabled also vote. DAWN  We want our sisters to make us  welcome in what has been a mostly  able-bodied feminist community.  Empowerment was what we  hoped women would find at Conference 88, empowerment to go  home and make changes in their  lives. We know changes are difficult. We know families and communities resist change, especially if  it costs money. But if even so few  as fifty women made personal vows  to get active in their own places,  we will have worked for a good  cause. Our twin causes are education and access.  Some beautiful women are the  volunteers who make a disabled  conference possible, women who  transfer helpless persons to the  toilet, then cleanse the anus,  and make the procedure dignified.  Known as Pathfinders, they run  errands, push wheelchairs, baby  sit, swim-one-on-one with participants. And the camp staff honours  any requests for hot water bottles,  ice packs, and odd diets. Other  women, such as ones from Women  Against Violence Against Women  (WAVAW), were there for personal  counselling of women in battering  situations, with mates or parents,  women insist on defining for governments our needs. We tell; they  listen. That's the new reality.  At the DAWN B.C. annual general meeting, the resolution was  passed that we get the attention  of our able-bodied sister feminists.  Money is always a problem, but we  can offer to cost share programs  with DAWN defining the needs of  disabled women in any venture.  Women helping women is something that has made survivors of  us all.

The foot lands on the drive outside the main lodge  at Lion's Easter Seal Camp Squamish. She limps into the entry wearing  a face blank with uncertainty. Having learned about this conference on  violence in Kinesis, she is joining more than one-hundred others to get  a new sense of herself, and to plan a future better than the past.

New Democratic Party  has pledged to make pay equity  for women part of the party's platform in the next provincial election.  Leader Mike Harcourt told 150  delegates at a B.C. Federation of  Labour conference if elected he  would table that a pay equity bill  would be tabled in the legislature by 1989, following consultation throughout the province.  The NDP plan to consult employers, chambers of commerce,  labour councils and small businesses before drafting legislation.  Earlier, the B.C. Federation of  Labour released its model for pay  equity legislation which included  the implementation of a Pay Equity Act, applying to both union  and non-union employers.  "There are a variety of ways to  carry out pay equity," says Harcourt. "There is the traditional approach of job evaluation, there is  also one similar to the approach  we took in the City of Vancouver  of eliminating lower pay grades."  Pay equity legislation represents  a shift in focus for the NDP "a major part of which will be dedicated  to equality for women," says Harcourt.

In a recent letter to the Vancouver Status of Women a Native woman writes: "I  am running out of patience and there is no  one to help me, I am getting the run around  and feel I am being treated unfairly.  "I would appreciate any help you can  give me, an update on Bill C-31 regarding  on-reserve homes, the housing subsidy, how  much I am entitled to under Bill C-31, and  what happens if the council (band) rejects  me, do I have any legal rights?"  Previous to Bill C-31 Native women who  married non-Native men lost their status  and many were forced to leave their reserves  while men, by contrast, conferred status on  their non-Native wives. Since the Bill was  passed in 1985, 97,200 applications for status have been received by the Department  of Indian Affairs, primarily from women.  (Some Indian men voluntarily gave up their  status and are also applying to be reinstated.)  Although the Bill was initially considered  a victory, many now feel it embodies false  equality for Native women and instead leads  to other kinds of discrimination.  In the revised Act, for instance, a reinstated woman is less able to transmit status  and band membership to her children than  is a woman who never lost her status.  , Applicants, both of whose parents are or  were eligible for status under Bill C-31, will  be registered under Section 6(1) of the new  Act. Those with only one parent eligible will  be registered under Section 6(2).  People registered under 6(2) have fewer  rights than do those registered under 6(1).  They cannot pass their status to their children unless the child's other parent is also  a registered Indian.  According to a study by Joan Holmes of  the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women (CACSW), many reinstated  women are unwilling to move onto their reserves with their children if the children do  not have band membership.  "As soon as they (the children) begin to  work or want to set up their own households, they can no longer live on the reserve,  nor can they inherit their parent's property,  share the band resources, or participate in  Native political life."  Single mothers must now name their  child's father otherwise he is assumed to be  non-Native and the child will be registered  as a 6(2) Indian and might be excluded from  band membership.  Single mothers are often reluctant to reveal the man's name, and the requirement  that they do this is considered by many  to be unfair discrimination against women  without a partner who raise children.  "This is racist, sexist and is directly  against women's cultural rights," said  Donna Pinay in the Saskatchewan Native  Women's Association's Newsletter. "Culture is transmitted largely through women  ... and therefore a child with an Indian  mother is an Indian regardless of biological  paternity."  Perhaps the most significant and often  problematic effect of Bill C-31 for Native  women occurs when they return to their  reserves. In many cases women are excluded from becoming band members and  "Culture is transmitted largely through  Indian mother is an Indian regardless of  women ...  and therefore a child with an  biological paternity."  are therefore not able to share the reserve's  entitlement which includes housing, income  from band resources, health and welfare, education, and voting rights. (A woman must  reapply for band membership independent  of her status application.)  Instead these women face suspicion, hostility and often rejection upon returning  home.  According to Kathleen Jamieson of Vancouver's Indian Homemakers Society, there  is a fear among Native bands that reinstated  women will flood the reserves and deplete  the already scarce resources. Lack of money  for housing, she says, is one of the greatest  Indian Homemakers  Conference focuses on violence  ~     :  Darlene la Rievere and Celeste Howard were two of the participants at this years  Indian Homemakers conference.  by Noreen Shanahan  A hundred B.C. Native women recently  met in Vancouver to develop a plan of action around eliminating domestic violence.  The women, delegates to the Indian  Homemakers Association's (IHA) annual  conference held in early March, discussed  the social, political and economic context  of violence, traditional ways of dealing with  family violence, and how to set up a transition house on a reserve.  At present, battered women are returning  to their families, one woman said, getting  protection from the men there. "And then  a kind of cold war begins between her father  and brothers on one side, and her husband  on the other."  The idea of having a transition house on  a reserve is a new one, she said, and wondered whether a band would assist in it's  funding or whether women would need to  raise the money and run the house.  Some women believed bands would refuse  to fund, especially now when reinstated  women (as a result of Bill C-31) are having difficulty getting housing for themselves  and their families.  "Our reserve is just now starting to build  houses," one woman said. "We figure we'll  need four houses a year just for newly returned status people."  The Indian Homemakers Association,  a non-profit organization with 92 locals  throughout B.C., has lobbied on behalf  of Native women—status, non-status and  Metis—for the past 23 years on such issues as: Native child apprehension, Bill C-  31, and affirmative action.  The organization is now lobbying for increased operational funding from the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA).  "DIA is still telling us to get band support and I feel they are still finding reasons to cop out any funding support to  Indian Homemakers," said IHA president  Rose Charlie. "I find this hard to accept,  when we have and serve special problem  needs for our people at the local levels  whether it's at the reserve levels or for our  status people in urban settings, also for the  people that are lost and not really knowing  whether they want to apply for their status  or remain in the category of non-status."  Herb George, a Gitksan-Wetsuwet'en,  spoke at the conference about the land  claim dispute presently heard in the B.C.  Supreme Court.  The women passed around a drum and  collected $75 in a show of support for  the Gitksan-Wetsuwet'en people. They also  chose to rearrange scheduled workshops in  order to cross the street and attend some  of the land dispute hearings at the Robson  courthouse.  problems faced by returning women.  "The policy on reserves is to make that  money (for housing) available for bands to  decide who shall get it. Some bands allocated this to women returning and others  put these women on the bottom of the wait  list and give the money to whoever is on  top. Some believe that it would be unfair to  put women on top of the list just because  they've returned."  Many women won't go back to the reserve  at all, Jamieson said, because they feel they  wpn't get decent housing and that standards  are better off the reserve.  Meanwhile, off the reserve, Native women  are being given the runaround when applying for financial assistance. According to the  National Action Committee on the Status  of Women Newsletter Feminist Action,  one Vancouver woman had her welfare payments cut off and was told, instead, to go to  her reserve and get help.  "A woman may be living in the city and  apply for social assistance here and find that  she is actually supposed to be a reserve  ident and so she's told to apply there," said  Jamieson. "Women are being batted back  and forth for assistance; she can't get it anywhere."  According to the CACSW report,  other area of concern around Bill C-31 is  the lack of family law protection for women  under the new Indian Act.  "Because provincial laws do not apply on  reserves, and the Indian Act does not make  specific regulations for division of reserve  property upon divorce or separation, most  Indian women are left with no legal rights  to occupy their family home, keep household goods, or bar an abusive partner.  "While, in practice, a band council may  support and assist a woman, she has no legal rights on which to depend. Because reserve housing is so often in critically short  supply, a woman may have to take her children off the reserve in order to find shelter  for them."  Bill C-31 contains a second clause  tended by the Department of Indian Affairs as a first step toward Native self-  government. It gives bands freedom to de-  Please see Status pg 19  KINESIS Across Canada  \^^^^^^^^^^^^^  by Pat Feindel  Benefits  extended  Parental benefits will be available to men for the first time  under a new unemployment insurance law introduced in Parliament. The new measures will  only apply to those men in "tragic  circumstances"—cases where the  mother is disabled or dead. The  bill will also allow mothers of babies who stay in hospital to begin  their benefit period when the baby  returns home, rather than on the  day of birth.  Victory at  Inco  A human rights inquiry has  found that Inco Ltd. acted illegally  in barring women of child-bearing  age from working in certain jobs  that entail a slight risk of fetal  damage. Laurene Wiens had applied for a higher paying job in the  company's nickel refinery but was  told she was ineligible because of  being a woman. The job exposed  workers to occasional small leaks  of gases that could cause damage  to fetuses. The inquiry found that  ''such a small risk does not warrant blanket discrimination on the  basis of sex, affecting all women  from their early teens until their  late forties." It added that women  should be warned of the risk, and  could be required to state that  they practice birth control.  United  gays  A United Church of Canada recommendation to allow the ordination of homosexuals has been  met with both jubilation and consternation by the church's 900,000  members. A report written by the  thirteen member National Coordi  nating Group calls for greater acceptance of diverse lifestyles including bisexuality and homosexuality and admits that "the church  has too readily accepted marriage  as the norm for society and so  has not valued single persons nor  allowed them the opportunity of  sexual fulfillment." The report included two dissenting opinions and  has stirred controversy in parishes  across the country. It will be debated at the August meeting of the  General Council, where parish representatives will vote on whether  to accept it as policy.  Church leaders admit there may  be churches or members who feel  they must leave over the policy. But Moderator of the United  Church, Anne Squire, stated, "We  can't hide our heads in the sand  and pretend gays and lesbians  don't exist in the community, in  the church, and in the ministry."  Women  at risk  The federal government has  promised to make it easier for  women refugees to come to Canada, especially if they are single  mothers whose lives are in danger.  Minister of State for Immigration  Gerry Weiner said women at risk  will be identified by the United  Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees and screened by Canadian officials using relaxed requirements to "recognize their special  needs."  Meanwhile in Montreal, minister for External Relations Monique  Landry announced that the federal  government is donating $3 million  to provide credit for women in four  African countries. The money has  been turned over to three Canadian cooperatives to be loaned  for projects in Togo, Ivory Coast,  Zaire and Ghana. Women in Africa  do up to 80 percent of agricultural work but have little access to  credit.  Lesbians  not spouses  A Toronto lesbian has lost her  battle in Ontario's Supreme Court  to gain health coverage under the  provincial health plan for her partner of ten years. Although the  librarian was backed in her efforts by her union and her employer (the Toronto public library  board), the Court said the couple could not be considered married because they are lesbians, and  would therefore not be eligible for  family coverage.  In a 1986 B.C. case, a teacher  won spousal health benefits for her  lesbian partner under a private  health insurance plan after filing  a grievance against her employer.  The employer had denied access  to the benefit plan although the  health insurance company did not  have a policy excluding same-sex  partners.  Domestic  protection  The Household Workers Association of Montreal has spearheaded  a public campaign to gain better  protection for domestic workers  under Quebec's labour law. "We  maintain that anyone whose main  source of income comes from doing  household work should be guaranteed certain rights, just like any  other worker," said Maria Ciampi  of the organisation. The group  is seeking three major changes:  to include all domestics under  the Labour Standards Act (those  & V& V#  & Q^ Q*  who care for children are now excluded), to grant live-in domestics wage parity with live-out domestics, and to give live-in domestics overtime pay after 44 hours of  work a week instead of 53. Petitions have been circulated, and Association representatives met with  Minister of Labour Pierre Par-  adis in January. He appeared to  agree to include more domestics  under the Labour Standards Act  and grant wage parity for live-in  domestics. The changes are due in  the legislature this fall.  Adoption  case  explosive  A New Brunswick Court of Appeal ruling on child apprehension could have an explosive impact on adoptions, according to  the province's Community Services Department. The decision  says the ministry of community  services must convince a judge  that permanent wardship leading  to adoption is in the child's best  interests before a court can order  wardship.  The decision involved  two sisters who were taken from  their mother—judged to be incapable of caring for them—in 1986.  The mother appealed and regained  guardianship as well as a custody  order that must be reviewed regularly.  A lawyer for Community Services says the decision makes it almost impossible for the state to  permanently apprehend children.  The case will be appealed in the  Supreme Court of Canada in May.  AIDS  Numbers  growing  AIDS among women is on the  increase, says Barbara Yaffe, associate medical officer of health  in Toronto. Women accounted for  just over four percent of new AIDS  infections reported in Toronto in  1987, compared to less than one  percent in 1985. Half of the women  got the infection from sexual contact with infected men, said Yaffe.  Yaffe also pointed to lower than  anticipated overall infection rates  and credited successful education  programs with slowing the spread  of the disease. She said the lower  rates reflected changes in sexual  behaviour more among the gay  rather than the heterosexual population, and cautioned heterosexuals to avoid high-risk sexual activities.  Childcare  plan waits  Frustration with the federal  government's promised $5.4 billion childcare plan is mounting  across the country. The National  Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) has called  the plan "a public relations scam  and launched a national campaign  to demand that Prime Minister  Mulroney account for his promise. Maureen Hemphill of Manitoba's community services ministry says federal officials seem  confused about how the program  is to be implemented, and so Manitoba can make no further plans.  And Nova Scotia community services minister Tom Mclnnis has  said federal Health Minister Jake  Epp led him to expect funding for  up to 70 percent of new day care  costs, but now appears willing to  pay only 50 percent. Three billion dollars of the program was  to be allotted to federal-provincial  cost-sharing arrangements to create new childcare spaces. The federal government was to set up a  50-50 cost-sharing plan with richer  provinces and provide a "top-up"  for poorer ones.  REAL  trouble  A long-standing internal battle  for control of REAL (Realistic,  Equal and Active for Life) Women  has resulted in the formation of  a splinter group, Family Forum.  The split involved accusations of  mishandled money, but appeared  to stem mostly from disagreements  over how much to stress Christian  values. "I don't think we are quite  as conservative as they are," said  the new president of REAL, Lettie  Morse. "I don't think we want to  be a religious group."  Gwendolyn Landolt, a REAL  founding member, said many Family Forum members oppose all day  care, while REAL sees a need for  childcare for some families. Family  Forum announced their first priority would be helping the anti-  abortion movement. The group  will also allow men to join.  Research  limits  Research on human embryos  will be allowed in Canada by the  Medical Research Council (MRC),  one of three agencies in Ottawa  that finance scientific research.  The new MRC guidelines permit  research on laboratory embryos  created by in vitro fertilization for  the first 17 days of gestation. The  guidelines do not permit the creation of embryos in "laboratory  factories" solely for the purpose of  experimentation, and the research  funded must be for improving or  evaluating the safety of in vitro  techniques. The 17 day limit is  three days longer than the 14 days  adopted by most other countries  with similar guidelines. The guidelines also allow research on fetuses  in utero, subject to the informed  consent from the mother and provided the fetus is not harmed. The  MRC opposes making it's guidelines into legislation.  KINESIS ///////////////////^^^^^  /////////////////////^^^^  LABOUR  Alberta  Nurses fight back and win  by Bernadette Stringer  Despite provincial legislation passed in  1983 prohibiting hospital strikes 11,000 Alberta nurses voted overwhelmingly to walk  off the job in January. Despite threats of  jail and fines they struck and stayed out for  nineteen days.  During those nineteen days the United  Nurses of Alberta (UNA) was found guilty  of criminal contempt twice and fined  $400,000. About 200 individual members  of UNA were charged with civil contempt  along with twenty-five locals. Sixty-two of  the individuals and many of the locals were  found guilty and fined a total of $26,000.  Over 2,000 nurses were disciplined by their  employers and 150 fired.  But rather than weakening the union or  the strike the membership of UNA seemed  to grow stronger and more determined with  each fine or firing. .  According to Heather Molloy, secretary  treasurer of UNA, the strike was a success. -  The new collective agreement contains an  11 percent wage increase for most members (with seven years experience) and eight  percent for all others—over a twenty-seven  month contract. It also contains improved  benefits and full back-to-work amnesty.  The contract contains no cutbacks despite original employer demands for a three  percent wage rollback, loss of seniority  rights in layoffs, scheduling concessions, and  takeaways in sick leave, workers' compensation and disability benefits.  A union comprised mostly of women took  on a right wing government and an employer determined to force cutbacks and the  union won. The power of the state proved  no match for 11,000 unified, well-organized  and militant nurses.  Learning From Experience  Can it happen here? That was the topic  of discussion at a public meeting and other  events the week of March 7 as the secretary-  treasurer of UNA was in Vancouver to raise  consciousness and money.  Could a British Columbia union take on  the provincial government and win? The  subject is on many union activist's minds as  a long hot summer of contract negotiations  looms in King Vander Zalm's domain.  What about the B.C. Nurses' Union?  Why do B.C. nurses seem so docile compared with their sisters and brothers in Alberta? II the Social Credit government continues with its policies of cutbacks and privatization will nurses in this province be  willing to fight?  Rather than speculating about what may  or may not happen in B.C., a more useful exercise is examining the source of Alberta nurses' activism and the reasons for  their success in a province with a limited  tradition of labour militancy. What can be  learned from their experience?  To meet Heather Molloy is to realize that  the source of UNA's success is definitely  not a core of leftwing activists schooled in  rhetoric who always know the "correct line"  before the membership.  Molloy is a chain-smoking, married, fifty-  year old who has worked as a nurse for over  twenty years. She defies the stereotype of  a radical labour leader and yet defines militant more honestly than any dozen well-  paid union bureaucrats.  She carries around a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King that reads: "In no sense do  I advocate evading or defying the law ...  That would lead to anarchy ... An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells  him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the  penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse  the conscience of the community over its in-  The power of the state proved no match for 11,000 unified, well organized and militant nurses.  justice, is in reality expressing the highest  respect for the law."  When asked, Molloy says she is not a  militant. She is "quietly determined", a description she applies to UNA as a whole.  Her "pohtical" experience is solely in her  union. She first became active while working on Vancouver Island then continued after moving to Edmonton in the early 1980's.  She has been active in UNA for the past six  years. She has sat on the union executive  since last December.  Fighting Back  In addition to the strike this year, UNA  has had to fight an anti-union government  by striking in 1977, 1980 and 1982. These  battles have produced, in Molloy and others, a sort of un-selfconscious class struggle language that is authentic rather than  contrived and heartfelt rather than imposed. Anyone who listened to her on radio  talk shows or heard her speak at a variety  of labour-sponsored meetings in Vancouver  understands that she understands what it  means to be a working woman in Canada in  1988.  For Molloy and perhaps thousands of  other Alberta nurses their experience as  nurses, as working women, as pawns in a  larger government battle against the union  movement, has radicalized them.  Back in the 1970's the provincial government and local hospitals fought the creation  of UNA. But Alberta nurses persisted to improve their working conditions and wages in  a province with the highest standard of living in Canada.  Then when oil prices and the biggest  source of provincial revenue collapsed in the  early 1980's, Alberta nurses were faced with  fighting cutbacks, both in their working conditions and in patient care. The power of  the state was directly aimed at them with  the 1983 law banning strikes.  UNA members mobilized like no other  nurses in Canada. Their struggles, especially the most recent strike, have put them  in the forefront not only of nurses but of all  Canadian workers.  Yet the recent history of government ac  tions against Alberta nurses is not significantly different from Social Credit action against nurses in B.C. In this province  nurses have also faced cutbacks, deteriorating working conditions and wages, already  low in comparison to "men's work", that  have not kept up with inflation for more  than five years. But B.C. nurses have not  fought back, at least not in the same spectacular and successful fashion as their Alberta counterparts.  Different Levels of Militancy  What is the explanation for the glaring differences in militancy between UNA and the  B.C. Nurses' Union? Leadership? Perhaps  in a sense, yet as Molloy kept repeating, the  strength of UNA is not its leadership, but  rather, its membership.  That membership, certainly very similar to the membership of the BCNU in  background, has gained the experience and  self-confidence necessary to fight and win  strikes. Even illegal strikes. The membership of the BCNU has not gained that self-  confidence or experience. Why?  Therein lies the answer to the explanation of different levels of militancy. The  United Nurses of Alberta has a structure  that encourages, even demands, the involvement of rank-and-file nurses in all levels of  decision-making and action. The BCNU has  a structure that seems to discourage ordinary nurses from getting involved with their  union.  The differences in structure between the  two unions are immense.  UNA has a local structure with presidents of those locals spending up to three  days a week performing union business.  BCNU has no local structure. It is divided  into huge regions with regional executives  having little power.  In UNA, elected local grievance committees decide whether or not an issue goes to  arbitration. In the BCNU, paid staff make  those decisions.  hi Alberta, 11,400 unionized nurses employ seven staff members (excluding clerical workers) in two offices (Calgary and Ed  monton). In B.C. about 19,000 unionized  nurses employ twenty-five staff (again excluding clerical workers) in one centralized  office in Burnaby.  The elected provincial president of UNA  works for the union four days out of five  each week. Hers is the most powerful position in the union. The idea behind going to  work once a week is to keep in contact with  the membership.  The elected president of the BCNU is little more than a figurehead. She chairs council and other meetings and represents the  union occasionally but has no day-to-day  role at the union office. She is not even considered a union employee during her term.  The real power in the union is held by the  non-elected chief executive officer.  During the recent UNA strike thousands  of members picketed, defying the government and courts. Despite arrests and firings  the strike grew stronger. The government  never even bothered to arrest the leadership (although they were fined) of the union  but concentrated its attack on rank-and-  file nurses who quite clearly controlled the  strike. The BCNU has never conducted a  province-wide strike on such a scale. In fact  general duty nurses who comprise 15,000  BCNU members have never been on strike.  The list of differences between the BCNU  and UNA is long and adds up to a fundamental structural divergence. The BCNl  can most accurately be characterized as an  organization that relies upon the technica  expertise of a large and well-paid bureaucracy to service its members. UNA is a much  more activist, day-to-day democratic organization that relies upon developing militancy and expertise among rank-and-file  members to achieve its goals.  Union members must look carefully at  both models before deciding which one  achieves the best results. Based upon results so far UNA seems to offer the more  attractive option for these difficult and trying times. The United Nurses of Alberta  has proved itself an organization capable ol  fighting and winning.  KINESIS Abortion  No sellout on abortion rights  by Margaret J. Priestly Birrell  Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision striking down section 251 of the Criminal Code, the issue of abortion rights has  been front and centre on our National and  Provincial agendas. The Court's decision  marked the most historic event in the long  struggle for women's rights. The result of  the decision was that, under law, women  could exercise control over their bodies.  Carrying a pregnancy to term became a  woman's decision. The rights involved here  are much more significant than the right to  own property or the right to vote.  The sense of victory that followed the  Court's announcement was sweet, but all  too short.  The full text of the Court decision makes  it clear that the Justices recognized the  rights women gained with the elimination of  section 251. Unfortunately, the Justices also  showed unseemly haste in pointing the political way to the elimination of these same  rights.  The ensuing debates swirled around freestanding abortion clinics, doctors' fee schedules, the Canada Health Act, fundamentalist family units, homes for unwed mothers, foster care incentive programs, adoption  policy, pain thresholds of fetuses, libertarian civil rights, legitimate law-breaking and  even zero population growth.  As the rancour intensified, the issue of  women as holistic beings gradually diminished and their rights and needs were again  atomized or ignored.  To this boiling pot an old red herring  has been thrown to bring the pot down to  simmer—fetal rights.  The focus of the debates has shifted  to Ottawa and the predominant political language is peace, harmony and compromise. In keeping with this tone, more  and more political strategists, commentators and politicians are presuming the in-  The result of this trap was predictable.  As the amalgam of pro-choice forces grew,  the women's rights issue became ethereal  rather than the corner-stone of the argument. Wide-ranging definitions of individual choice now abound. This catalogue of  definitions only surfaced after the Supreme  Court decision. In sharp contrast, the pro-  life  forces   state  categorically   that  fetal  To this boiling pot, an old red  herring has been thrown to bring  the pot down to a simmer — fetal  rights.  evitability of an Abortion Act and have focused the debate on balancing fetal and  women's rights. The gestation period is an  abstract concept and the demarkation line  will be settled by the political winds.  The debate cannot be about fetal versus  women's rights. The debate must be about  women as independent, rational beings.  It is not good enough to tell a woman  that she can have an abortion as long as it  is in the first sixteen weeks. This is a small  "1" liberal trap with catastrophic implications. The compromise appears fair and reasoned when it is in fact an insidious position. It would, under the guise of legitimate debate, re-entrench the paternalistic  concept of women as irrational, dependent  and amoral persons.  rights from conception are paramount.  The pro-choice advocates, in the attempt  to incorporate a broad-based coalition, too  often modified their language. Too often  one hears, "We are not for abortion on  demand!" What does this mean? Should  women plead and wait for a second party to  decide? Too often one hears that abortion is  solely a moral issue between a woman and  her conscience. This denies the reality that  abortion is and has been a political issue,  whether the politics are partisan, ethnic or  religious.  And too often one hears that abortion  is everyone's issue. Does this not invite the  argument that men should have an equal  say in the control of women's reproductive  rights? Too often one hears that abortion is  not a form of birth control. What is it, if it  is not the final form of birth control?  With this lack of theoretical cohesive-  ness, feminists' main opponent is not the  pro-lifers, but that large section of the pro-  choice movement that has bought and is  comfortable with the small "1" liberal argument.  Therefore, feminists' goal must be singular: no Abortion Act. The strategy must  be to win the goal on the position of  woman's right to control her reproductive  system—her body. The tactics must be to  first reclaim and define our language. To  guarantee reproductive services through the  Canada Health Act. To educate that abortion is indeed a women's issue. To work from  strength by refusing to indulge in the theatre of debate with pro-life advocates. Their  vote is solid. They do not want an Abortion Law. Any recognition of a balancing  of rights negates their argument on fetal  rights.  Lobbying efforts must focus on the diffuse and softened pro-choice forces. Feminists have been compromised and therefore  have been forced to compromise on such major issues as the Meech Lake Accord, the  Child Care Act, rape and divorce legislation  and affirmative action.  There can be no negotiations on the  Abortion Act. There can be no partisan  political compromises. There is no political  or moral victory possible with an Abortion  Act.  It is all or nothing. We cannot let our  sweet but short victory become a bitter  memory.  ||lHIlH»»IHIIl»»a»  SUPPORT  WOMEN  IN BUSINESS  SHIATSU  women's work  (604) 980-4235 J  Astarte  7-1916 E. 5th Ave.  Vancouver  251-5409  Creative Graphics and Custom Printing  T-SHIRTS-CAPS-SPORTSWEAR fxi^j^'  POSTERS-LOGOS-PROMOTION -  •t\MeJl  261 east 1st ave, north Vancouver, b.c.

Two hundred officers from BKA (German  equivalent of FBI), assisted by local police,  carried out simultaneous raids on thirty-  three addresses in the characteristically efficient style of the political police everywhere. They claim the sweep was to unearth  the activities of "Roten Zora" (Red Zora),  a feminist women's guerilla network, which  had claimed responsibility for a number of  bombings against government and corporate targets.  In a planned execution aimed, at painting a picture of state omnipotence, officers sealed off streets and forced their way,  with firearms drawn, into women's homes,  family members homes, work places, and  research centres. Citing the grounds for  the raids as "Article 129a" (paragraph of  West Germany's Criminal code with wide  applications concerning "terrorism") police  seized radio and video recordings, personal  mail, address books, mailing lists, and scientific material relating to human genetics, pre-natal diagnosis, and reproductive  technology research. Twenty-three women  were detained at police centres where they  were photographed, finger-printed, questioned, and in some cases strip-searched, before they were released.  Two women, Ulla Penselin and Ingrid  Strobl, remained under arrest, charged  with "membership in the terrorist organization Roten Zora." Strobl was arrested  by the GSG9 Swat Squad after a two-  day stakeout in her apartment and was  also charged with "suspicion of participation" in the October '86 sabotage attack  on Lufthansa Airlines—an action which  protested the forcible deportation of women  seeking refugee asylum and the promotion  of Southeast Asia sex-tourism. West German authorities announced dramatically  that they have cracked two cells of Roten  Zora. In mid-February, cross-country bulletins announced a further search for four  Roten Zora "terrorists-at-large." This is  not the first time that West Germany has  launched a massive crackdown on political activists but it is the first witchhunt  to come down specifically on the women's  movement.  photo, from Emma  Both of the arrested women are well-  known and active within feminist circles in  West Germany. Ulla Penselin, 36, has been  running a community print shop in Hamburg for ten years as well as organizing,  both locally and nationally, a vital network  exposing population control policies and genetic technology abuses. Ingrid Strobl, 35, is  a familiar name in most German households  after working seven years as a journalist  with Emma, the widely circulated liberal-  feminist monthly and campaigning for the  rights of refugees and immigrants. Strobl received her doctorate as a "Germanologist"  (specialist on German history and culture)  and, at the time of her arrest, had almost  completed writing a book on the armed resistance of European women against German naziism and fascism.

Both women have been denied bail based  on the prosecution's claims of "probable  flight", and are confined under the West  Germany fifteen point program of "special  regulations for political prisoners." The pivotal factor is the isolation, or "white torture", that has become the trademark of  the government's method of breaking down  prisoners.  "White torture" provisions include: non-  association with any other prisoners (political or general); solitary one hour daily  yard exercise; twenty-three hours daily in a  windowless security cell with empty neighboring cells; screened lawyer visits; censorship of mail; two hour visits only once  each month; restricted number of books;  and mandatory prison wear. All this even  though the women have not yet been  brought to trial but are merely charged.  Ingrid Strobl writes from prison early this  year ...  "The essential power interests of imperialism are attacked by the broad struggle  against gene technology and refugee policy.  This explains the almost hysterical activities of the state against people who lead this  struggle on every level. That these activities  primarily aim at women is also logical ...  All people who carry out these attacks must  be intimidated, and the militant ones must  be isolated and criminalized. Therefore, it  is only logical that suspects must be found  and if one can't find them, one has to create them."  Since the charges are based on weak evidence and the raids netted little, surveillance and intimidation of the feminist community has escalated in months since last  December as the police search for further  personal connections and hunt for witnesses  and/or informers. West German authorities have created a new term "Probable At  tack Issues" which, when combined with  their powers under Article 129a, gives them  grounds for harassment of all legal work.  According to feminists the government's  strategy is geared to destroying the effectiveness of movements resisting reproductive technology, sex-tourism, and refugee  deportation policies. The intent is to silence  all critics including journalists, lawyers, and  health professionals and keep the community under seige.  Considering the high profile of the two  detained suspects and the thin evidence  against them, many feminists are questioning the timing of the crackdown. Sabotage  actions from Roten Zora have increased in  the last two or three years with often impressive results, greatly disturbing the police. Public awareness and sympathy grew  for the women guerilla's demands and it is  thought that the police responded with a  power-play, both premature and miscalculated, to sow suspicion in the public and fear  among feminists.  Certainly neither of these have been the  result of the raids and arrests. Greater solidarity has been generated among radical activists who feel the harassment is, in spirit,  against all of them. Feminists, new to an  awareness of anti-imperialist perspectives  and activism, came to post-raid meetings,  donating money and making public statements attesting to the full range of support from women's cultural, service and political organizations. In several West German cities, feminists have sponsored workshops and conferences on gene technology, the trafficking in Third World women,  and women's struggles in the Third World.  Large support rallies in Koln and Hamburg  withstood police intimidation and provocation, and defense groups for Penselin and  Strobl have been set up in these two centres.  In general, the public has been inclined  toward sympathy for the actions carried  out by Roten Zora, which has been op  erating since the mid 70's and, in union  with Revolutionary Cells, another underground group, has carried out 250 attacks,  all within the context of current political affairs. Direct action strategy confronted issues of militarization, nuclear technology,  Palestine, South Africa, asylum solidarity,  and human genetics. During 1987, to support the long and painful efforts of South  Korean women striking for better conditions in German-owned textile factories,  Roten Zora launched a series of bombing  attacks against eight stores of "Adler Co."  (see Kinesis Nov. 1987) forcing Adler to  capitulate and meet the striker's demands.  Such successes enraged the government and  the urge for retaliation reached maximum  boil.  Are the authorities' claims of having paralyzed this women's resistance network accurate or just police hype? To quote an  anonymous German feminist... "the structure of women's organizations, and Roten  Zora, has always out-imagined the police."  The call from the defense groups is  "Freedom for Ingrid Strobl and Ulla  Penselin"—nothing less than that. International publicity and support can  help these political prisoners and strengthen the feminist community against  state assaults. Write the women  prison to let them know their isolation  is only physical. Ulla Penselin and Ingrid Strobl, c/o Ermittlungsrichter am  BGH, Herrenstrasse 45a, 7500 Karlsruhe, West Germany.

It may very  well be that this kid is not slow at all, he's  just left out. And even if he is slow, isn't  that all the more reason to include him?  So when the opportunity came along to  apply for a job compiling research on pesticides and developing educational materials  for farmworkers, I jumped at it. I thought  Fd have a better chance to deal with such  questions than I had as a bus driver. This  turned out to be true but not in the way I  expected.  One of the things I've volunteered to do  a few times at this new job is to drive people to events (once a bus driver ... ) So  it was last Sunday that I picked up three  older Indo-Canadian men in Vancouver and  set off for Richmond to pick up a fourth.  while the men in the back tried to say something in English that I didn't understand.  When I went up to the house an older  Indo-Canadian woman answered the door  and I greeted her with my one Punjabi  greeting which she returned. I then realized  that I didn't know how to tell her what I  was doing there because I wasn't even sure  of the name of the man I was supposed to  be picking up or how to pronounce it.  I was rescued by one of the men in the car  who got out and spoke to the woman. She  talked to him and I went back to the car. He  said to me, "We passed him on the road."  Suddenly I realized, that as we had been  driving along they had seen Pritam walking along the street and had called out his  name, just like I would have. Had I been taking them at their word I would have known  by Nora D. Randall  I have a new job. I know some of you may  be disappointed because you liked the stories I told about the kids on the bus. The  fact is I haven't told any stories about the  kids I had on the bus this year. Not that  they aren't great kids and not that there are  no stories, but the truth is I've felt an underlying heaviness of heart this year which has  taken the bounce out of most of the stories.  Every once in a while, or probably more  often than that if we're being truthful, the  many different variables of social relationships arrange themselves so that groups of  people operate at their worst and one person bears the onslaught of their petty vi-  ciousness. That's what happened on my  morning bus run last fall.  The last kid on my bus route was an immigrant kid who was slow both physically  and mentally. The other kids on the bus,  including the other kid who shared his cultural background, closed ranks against him  and made him the butt of their jokes. I  would like to be able to tell you that I found  some creative way to talk to the kids and  get them working as a group to draw this  kid in and make his life easier, but it didn't  happen.  I tried talking, yelling, assigning seats,  I refused to drive fast over their favorite  bump. I don't think they ever got it. I remember the day I stopped the bus in exasperation, and looked them all in the eye  through the mirror in the front of the bus.  We were just about to pick the kid up and  they were fighting over who would have to  sit next to him, after I'd been loudly condemning this practice for over a month.  I said, "I don't know what to say to you.  The idea that you don't pick on someone  whose weaker than you is so basic, I don't  know how to explain it." I looked at them  in the mirror. They were all looking at me.  They had all heard. (When I stop the bus  they know it's major trouble.) What I saw  in the mirror was sixteen pairs of eyes looking back at me through the prevailing culture we hve in. I knew there's no way someone eleven years old in this culture could  know that not picking on weaker people is a  shared basic belief. This is the age of hardball politics and bottom line business, where  competition is the only valued mode of operation. Winners are the good guys and losers  deserve no compassion because they could  have been winners and they chose to be  nerds.  I felt bad for all of us. I felt bad for myself because as a fat woman who'd been a fat  kid, and a lesbian, I know what it's like to be  isolated and made the target of group jokes.  I felt bad for the kids on the bus, because  on the bus they're the "In" group, but when  they get off that bus and go into the school  they're the kids in the special classes—not  a prestigious position in school society.  I felt bad for the slow kid, because I knew  that he didn't have to be as isolated as he  was.  It was also our loss. We never really found  out his story. I know that if I was on a bus  full of people all talking at once in the country he came from, I would have nothing to  say, and I would probably move very slowly  and be disoriented most of the time. If someone spoke to me in English I would immediately pep right up unless what they said  Two of these men I had given rides to before. We have a bit of a system. They tell me  where they are going. I drive to the neighborhood, then they tell me go straight, turn  right, turn, left, stop until we arrive at the  right house.  So it was that I drove out to Richmond  while they talked in Punjabi. As we were  nearing the place to turn to get to the right  house, all three of them suddenly said, "Pritam!", which I thought was the name of the  man I was going to pick up. I thought they  meant that I was nearing the turn to his  house. So I proceded along and made the  turn and started searching for his address  that. In fact, I should have known that because I already knew they would have said,  turn right if that's what they meant. I apologised and drove back to pick up Pritam.  Because I had tried to guess what they  were saying instead of simply listening to  what they said, we ended up having to stop  the car in the middle of the Steveston Highway in order for Pritam to get in. As the  string of cars piled up behind us, I cringed  knowing that most likely many of the people  held up by my awkward manoeuvre would  place the blame on these brown skinned,  turbanned men.  There is so much to learn.

In this letter of  May 20th 1986, Yoli Garcia patiently outlined to her union some of the small—and  not so small—brutalities of life in the garment trade. Nothing Yoli had to say would  have surprised the International Ladies'  Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU).  After a century of organizing, language  problems, harsh supervision, an abusive  piece work system and bleak working conditions persist as the overwhelming features of North America's clothing industry. This is the industry that gave us the  phrase 'sweatshop' and it is largely immigrant women who still do the sweating.  Change is, however, in the works—  change for the worse. Free trade and  B.C.'s year-old Bill 19 are forming a two-  headed monster that could ensure misery  for women in the garment trade for years  to come.  The Global Clothing Factory  An explosive increase in clothing manufacturers and contractors has occurred in B.C.  since 1984, according to Phyllis Webb, president of Vancouver's ILGWU locals: approximately 220 employers now compared with  75 prior to 1984. Industry-watchers like  Webb attribute this growth to investments  by Hong Kong entrepreneurs who are "getting their money out before 1999", the year  England 'returns' the colony to the People's  Republic of China.  Fall-out from colonial and neo-colonial  relations between countries is a major ingredient in Canada's garment trade. While the  home-grown industry presently enjoys tariff protection from imported clothing, North  American manufacturers increasingly take  advantage of appalling wage levels in Third  World countries.  Subsidiaries have been established in the  Caribbean, Asia and North Africa. Subcontracting labour-intensive components of the  manufacturing process to the Third World  I Fall-out from colonial and  neo-colonial relations is a  major ingredient...  is also common: designs, cuts and fabric  are shipped abroad for assembly. Tariff payment is avoided by importing near-finished  clothes and then sewing on a ribbon or some  other flourish.  Additionally, Canadian manufacturers  complain about competition from 'export  processing zones' in countries such as  Malaysia, Sri Lanka and India. There  transnational and local companies gain tax  and import duty concessions. More importantly, they are handed a virtually powerless  workforce, unprotected by minimum wage  laws and labour standards—and union-free.  This exploitation of Third World workers  and the willingness of Canadian businesses  to use their labour, through subcontracting  or actual relocation, help maintain the depressed status of Canadian garment workers.  The woman working in an east end Vancouver jeans shop is, in terms of legal pro  tections, faring better than her counterpart  in Asia. As a Canadian, however, she joins  her immigrant sisters toiling as domestics,  cleaners and farmworkers in being among  the poorest, most ill-treated and ignored  of workers. Like those women, her work is  largely unregulated (despite existing laws)  and isolated (even within huge plants). It is  also, lest we forget, work that is skilled and  essential.  Phyllis Webb estimates that, of the  12,000 garment workers in B.C., 95 percent  are women and newcomers to Canada: immigrants from China, Hong Kong and India,  Vietnamese-speaking refugees, refugees too  from Central America. Employment takes  a variety of forms. Manufacturers, who design, cut and assemble product lines, tend  to be large: 100-300 workers. Some, like  Jantzen and Koret, are unionized. Contractors form the bulk of the industry. They  bid on specific tasks or lots (such as assembling pre-cut blouses) and execute the work  in their own shops or further subcontract,  then subsubcontract, out. Not a single B.C.  contractor is unionized.  The Piecework Treadmill  "When I first walked into some of those  shops," says Webb, "I couldn't believe it.  It's like back in the late 1800's." Webb describes "unreal" shops: a firetrap on Cordova Street above a welding firm; another  under Georgia Street. It is not uncommon  for women to work a twelve hour day without overtime. "They punch in twice—from  8 to 4, then again from 4 to 8."  The majority of women are mothers and  wives with that other job waiting at home;  during the day, their mothers or in-laws  tend the children. Like all working women,  the $4 or $5 an hour they earn is essential  to their family's survival.  The base hourly rate in non-union shops  is $5 an hour but "they'll cheat you—you'll  get $4 ," says Linda Leung, the ILGWU's  only full-time organizer. Leung's entry into  the trade began when she accompanied her  mother-in-law on a job search to Koret.  The company wasn't interested in the older  woman—age discrimination is rampant—  but offered Leung a cutter's job at $4 an  hour, promising her a raise at month's end.  They eventually told Leung the raise  wasn't forthcoming because "the union  won't allow it"—an anti-union tactic which,  ironically, alerted Leung to the fact that Koret was bdeed an ILG WU shop. Her knowledge of English made her an obvious candidate for shop steward.  But payment by piece work, not hourly  rates, is the industry norm and is subject to  abuse in unionized and non-unionized shops  alike.  The unorganized worker is presented  with a system which, as Webb describes,  "won't allow her to make more than $6.25 an  hour." (An example of piece work: A basic  hourly earning of $5 is set: this represents  10 belts sewn in 10 minutes at 8.3 cents a  unit; 60 belts an hour equals $5 an hour. If  a worker sews 15 belts in 10 minutes, she  would earn $7.47 that hour.)  Contractors base their bids to manufacturers on anticipated—and low—labour  costs and will simply slash the piece work  rate if a sewer proves too fast. When workers complain, they are told "if you don't like  it, go home," says Leung.  Besides rate-slashing, numerous factors  drag on a woman's ability to beat the  piece work treadmill: moving from machine  to machine, changing thread, learning new  styles, dealing with different fabrics ...  Since some jobs have a greater earning  potential than others (seams, for instance,  pay poorly compared to serging), the role  of the assigning supervisor is crucial. Leung  reports that some workers curry favour with  supervisors by gift-giving— "expensive gold  and jade jewelry. They think it will guarantee a life-time job." Because most workers  speak little or no English, supervisors rep-  AINESIS  When Guatemalan refugee Yoli Garcia was asked about the safety record of the garment factory where she worked, she had to laugh. "You didn't have time to lift your head  to see accidents," she said. "It was a race against time." But there were accidents (that  went unreported to the WCB), just as there was an unfair division of piece work, vengefui  supervision and disgusting washroom facilities. Garcia's was a union shop.  Garcia is a sculptor. Although factory work was new to her, she is an accompl  dustrial sewer, having supported herself for years: home sewing for small shops,  a small plant in Costa Rica. Like becoming a refugee, working in a Canadian garment  tory was not a matter of choice. "I didn't want to leave my country," says Garcia, "but  the exploitation and treatment were so bad. That made it hard for me to accept the be  treatment here. I might just as well have stayed in Guatemala."  She doesn't think her own story is particularly important. But Garcia wants  understand that the few countries who do take refugees—the capitalist countries  exploit them— are also the countries causing the wars that produce refugees.  Her year in the factory ended when she complained about the price of some  was fired. "The union couldn't defend me because no one [in the plant] would t£  what happened," says Garcia. "The boss just said, 'She lied, she really quit.' Tl  are all afraid." This fear, this "individualism" frustrated Garcia, but she under  "Because people are afraid of losing their jobs they end up supporting the systt  mechanism of the system to use the unemployed in this way."  (Thanks to Claire Kujundzic for inter/  resent the bridge between middle management and the sewers.  As Webb puts it, "Employers try to hire  supervisors of the workers' ethnic group,  then use them to do their dirty work. If the  union complains [about a supervisor's actions] management excuses themselves with  'We don't understand what the supervisor  said' or 'she wouldn't dare say that—she  knows better."  Piece work is destructive on more than an  economic level. When the noisy monotony of  a typical sewing factory combines with the  stress of high-speed work, women can literally lose their minds.  Leung describes what happened when  Marjorie Hamilton, an established firm,  adopted a new management system in 1984.  "They converted to piece work and laid off  the older workers. No matter how long you'd  been there—15 years even—or if you were  a very good worker. On piece work, one  woman went crazy. She got locked up in  the General and didn't recognize anyone. 'I  can't do it any more,' she said."  Before piece work, Marjorie Hamilton  paid $4 an hour regardless of a woman's  seniority. "Only friends of supervisors got  more," says Leung. Different rates of pay  among workers are not uncommon.  Health hazards abound for the garment  worker. "Carpal tunnel and tennis elbow  are common complaints and we've won  about 12 cases at workers compensation,"  says Webb. Rashes and skin irritations result from handling fabrics from certain dye  lots and from dyeing chemicals themselves  (some shops dye their own buttons). "Steam  pressing fabrics with perma-prest or stay-  flex chemicals [can lead to] eye infections,"  says Webb.  She laments that most of the industry's  injuries—cuts and needle stabs-go unreported. "Women don't even stay off work  for infections from cuts," says Webb. "They  don't know their rights."  Language: The Barrier to Organizing  No one is in any hurry to tell them their  rights, either. Annie Choy administers the  Strathcona Manpower Outreach Project, a  13- year old agency funded by the federal  Canada Employment. "Our target group  is the Chinese-speaking immigrant woman  who earns a living working with her hands  ... because they speak no English," says  Choy. They provide "a bridge" between  business and workers, responding to employers' calls for sewers.  Choy knows about ill-treatment because  women "... come back to complain." Their  complaints range from being denied washroom breaks to hair pulling. She knows that  employers will say outright that they "...  don't allowed unionized workers," and when  they request 'young' workers, "We don't  quarrel with them but tell them very nicely  that an experienced sewer who is 55 or 60  is still very good."  Manpower Outreach does not, as a matter of course, inform workers about the employment laws which should govern their  workplaces.  For Leung, the language barrier is the  greatest hurdle facing an organizer. Without English or even a common language,  garment workers remain unaware of their  rights and isolated. The ILGWU has sponsored workplace English as a Second Language (ESL) courses but they are fraught  with difficulties. "At Surrey Classics, we  had classes during the half-hour lunch  break. Some women liked it, but it was over  100 women and only half-an- hour..." says  Leung.  Linda Leung, ILGWU organizer  There is always a funding scramble with  workplace ESL courses. Kathy Vance of the  B.C. Teachers of English as an Additional  Language (TEAL) can cite a string of 'pilot  projects' which ran successfully, then were  routinely dropped by their government hinders.  "In England, the situation is much better," says Vance. "English is taught in many  workplaces on paid time." But employers  here are less than enthusiastic about having informed workers and the ESL courses  at night school or community colleges are  often beyond women's reach.  The obstacles are numerous. Women's  domestic responsibilities make it virtually impossible for them to leave home  for courses. Cultural attitudes also apply; according to a spokesperson from the  Vancouver Society on Immigrant Women,  "Some women can't get out of the house unless they're making money."  The federal government is distinctly  guilty of denying women access to ESL  classes. Canada Employment will pay an  immigrant to take a five month course—  but not sponsored immigrants (which most  women are), and only if they are immediately headed for the job market (which female spouses are rarely seen to be doing).  A suit recently launched by LEAF (a feminist group) in Ontario is challenging those  practices on the basis of sex discrimination.  In the meantime, union organizers do  what they can with an industry that plays  every anti-worker, anti-union card in the  deck. Exploiting workers' fears is prime.  "Some Vietnamese and Chinese people  had so much hardship getting here, and  some associate the union with the Communist Party which, for them, was bad, " says  Leung. "I have to really persuade them that  unions are for working people."  Jaswant Sanghara (not her real name)  works in a Richmond drapery and dress  shop certified by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. Ten of the  workers are Pakistani women who were previously expelled from the U.S. Although living legally in Canada, their employer refuses  to pay them union rates—and threatens to  have them deported. The situation at work  is hair- raising: employees are encouraged  to spy and rat on each other; some are paid  $8.50 an hour, others $5.35; a union supporter was falsely accused of stealing discarded fabric and fired—and the company  has promised to raise wages if the workers  'chose' to decertify.  The pressure is on at home, too. "Often the husband must approve of signing a  union card," says Leung. "One woman was  willing to join but her husband said, "When  we came to this country I agreed with the  immigration officer not to sign anything, not  to join a union." The women know they're  being exploited, but they're scared of losing  their jobs."  There is cause for fear. Sanghara knows  her rights and when a previous employer  called her in for one hour's work, she reminded him that he must pay her for four.  End of job. Other workers have been threatened with blacklisting if they testify at  labour board hearings—and the threats are  effective.  More subtle forces are also at play. Although the vast majority of women have  sewing experience from their native countries or have paid for power-sewing night  school courses, some women receive on-the-  job training. "They feel they owe the boss  something," says Leung.  Bill 19: Help for the Bosses  All these factors take their toll. Recently,  the ILGWU organized and then lost two  major manufacturers, Marjorie Hamilton  and Snazzi. Webb has no doubt about Bill  19's role.  "At Marjorie Hamilton, we negotiated  for a first contract between June 1986 and  February 1987 and the employer never put  one proposal on the table. Two weeks before Bill 19, we got their offer: it was full  of Bill 19." The firm's lawyers, Jordan and  Gall, had a hand in actually writing the repressive legislation.  I The company has promised  to raise wages if the workers 'chose' to decertify.  The standard ILGWU contract, signed in  September 1987, was "gutted at Marjorie  Hamilton," says Webb. "We lost automatic  dues check-off and the closed shop." They  also lost the "no contracting out to nonunion shops" and the anti-double-breasting  clauses—both features of Bill 19. Union supporters were slowly eliminated, through layoffs, until only 70 of the 219 pro-union workers remained. The company "put the fear of  m  fk  <$j|l Earlier this century, the quest  by garment workers for social  and economic justice inspired  i$jM^ the famous anthem Bread and  Roses.  In British Columbia today,  women still struggle for "a  sharing of life's glories..."  god" into a union witness prior to the decertification hearing and she refused to testify about their anti-union tactics. The shop  decertified.  Even without Bill 19 certifying a garment  factory was difficult. A union has only 3  months from the time the first card is signed  and an organizer typically must visit people  3 or 4 times, at night. High turnovers are  common.  Now, management has the right to publicly express an opinion about unionization and there is no automatic certification  mechanism. Decertification may commence  during negotiations if 45 percent of workers  petition it—and new non- union employees  may sign that petition. If a strike is called,  no picketing of the business's union suppliers would be allowed, and the workers would  be compelled to vote on any offer the company made. Bill 19 may not have been aimed  at the lowly garment worker, but it has hit  her squarely.  Free Trade: The Latest Threat  Bill 19 is, however, aimed at the free trade  scenario that dances, like a sugar plum  fairy, before the eyes of Socred politicians  and businessmen. A low-wage, unorganized  workforce is just the ticket for competing with American entrepreneurs—yet free  trade is going to be an absolute bust for the  already low- wage garment trade.  Textile and clothing workers in the southern U.S. 'sun belt' are poorly paid and  hamstrung by age-old anti-union traditions.  Even their livelihoods are being challenged  by the new 'free trade zones' on the Mexican  border where garment workers receive $4 a  day. By these standards, Canadian workers  are indeed overpaid.  Recently, Canada's major clothing manufacturer Peter Nygard (Tanjay) leapt off the  free trade bandwagon, threatening to close  down his Canadian factories and predicting  a loss of 115,000 jobs. "We knew this all  along," says Webb.  Not all businessmen are screaming. According to Webb, some wealthy manufacturers (Pacific Rim investors the Socreds are  courting) are eager to establish themselves  here in order to sell to the U.S. when free  trade arrives.  Any clothing magnate who survives Free  Trade will do so on the very bent backs of  immigrant women.  KINESIS Health  Invisible disabilities  Lack of support and awareness hurts  by Marrianne van Loon  Donimo has her good days and her bad  days. Sometimes she doesn't leave the house  because her body hurts and she feels so  bad. External obligations and responsibilities have to wait until she takes care of  her most important responsibility, her own  health. But unless you know her well, you  would never know Donimo was disabled.  Ann Daskal used to have a great memory.  Last week, while driving home from work  she was congratulating herself on a good  day ... her mind had felt clear, and her  memory was working. Then she realized she  had forgotten to turn off the stove before  she left work. As she drove back to turn it  off, you would not have been able to tell if  she were having a bad day or a good day by  looking at her.  And as Eunice Brooks left home to attend a weekend conference, you would not  have been able to tell that she has at times  felt such extreme panic and anxiety that she  has been unable to leave her house. Looking  at her, it doesn't show.  Although their pain may take very different forms, Ann, Donimo and Eunice all  share one thing. None of them are able-  bodied, and in each their disability is not  physically visible.  The experience of women with invisible disabilities is qualitatively different from  that of obviously disabled women. The recent focus on disability and access issues in  the women's and other progressive movements has largely concentrated on only the  most obvious forms of disability. To most  people this means the stereotypical person-  in-a-wheelchair, or blind person with a dog  or cane. And so our movement tries to reach  more disabled women by making events and  buildings wheelchair accessible.  Yet Ann, who can walk up the stairs to  any building, may decide not to attend a  meeting where women smoke because she  will probably subsequently feel sick. Ann  suffers from multiple allergies so for her accessibility is a much larger issue than mere  accessibility by wheelchair.  As Eunice explains, it really comes down  to the expectations we have of each other.  Eunice, who lives with agoraphobia, a panic  disorder, was unable to even attend the 1987  B.C. Disabled Women's Network (DAWN)  conference which she had worked hard to  organize.  "I couldn't go because I couldn't get out  of the house." She did attend the conference  this March and had a wonderful time, except for when a participant remarked "It's  just great for you able-bodied people. You  can do anything you want."  The fact that she suffers extreme anxiety  was not validated, even at a DAWN conference, because she looked able-bodied. "Be  cause I have a strong voice people think I'm  something that I'm not. I found that really  hurtful. It seemed to her there was nothing  wrong with me because I wasn't in a wheelchair."  With an invisible disability, the invisibility can be the most limiting aspect of  a woman's problem. Because other people  don't see it, it means they have to have  faith when a woman says, "Please don't use  a camera flash around me, it will make me  nauseous and have diarrhea." Or if she says  she cannot help with some work she had  hoped to do because she has no energy.  "Because I'm rosy cheeked, I move without a limp, I look normal and healthy, people don't believe me when I say I am sick  and feel intense pain. Sometimes I don't  even validate it myself," says Donimo.  Having an invisible disability can be  analagous to being a lesbian in an exclusively hetrosexual environment. "I feel like  a big part of me is amputated but no one  knows that."  With some invisable disabilities, such as  epilepsy, discrimination is overt. In B.C.  epileptics are not allowed to drive, and are  not allowed to teach school. Eunice has  an epileptic friend who was fired from his  teaching job in Surrey after he had a seizure  at school. This kind of prejudice cost him his  career, and he has no possibility of appeal.  Was the Surrey school board afraid that the  students might learn something about disabilities that they did not themselves have  the openness and lack of fear to learn?  And if epileptics must deal with prejudice, those who suffer from anxiety and  panic disorders, such as hypochondria, must  deal with even more ridicule and lack of  understanding. Hypochondriacs are still the  butt of bad jokes and everyone laughs,  yet life as a hypochondriac is anything  but funny. So-called imaginary diseases still  cause very real pain and suffering, which  needs to be treated seriously, not trivialized  and laughed at.  All of the unaware reactions and expectations directed at invisibly disabled people have their roots in how society as a  whole sees, or does not see, disability. When  somebody asks Ann how she is doing, she  may feel like telling them the truth, but  won't bother because she knows they will  not know how to respond.  "It makes me really angry listening to  people talk in front of me about their problems, and have everybody give them special  consideration, because they are socially recognized and accepted problems. When I ex  plain my problem they don't know how to  act. It's not socially cool for me to have this  problem. And it makes me more invisible."  Hidden disabilities are highly variable—  not just from person to person but from  day to day, even hour to hour. An arthritic  woman may be unable to get up before noon  because she is so stiff and sore, and yet may  dance for hours that same night. "Just because I could do something last week does  not mean that I can do it this week," says  Eunice.  For an invisibly disabled woman trying  to be part of the women's movement with  its well recognized expectations of work and  commitment and the concurrent burnout  syndrome can be invalidating and even impossible. Cigarette smoke may be an obvious barrier, but not so obvious are the demands and expectations of co-workers.  Donimo used to be a member of the Lesbian Show on Vancouver's Cooperative Radio. She cannot predict in advance if she  would be feeling well enough to participate  on any particular day. Other show members  did not hear when she repeatedly explained  her disability. Some preferred to believe she  was being irresponsible, and that she should  get herself together and get over it.  "I was unable to find any words to educate them," she said. So she quit one night  while the show was on air, explaining to the  audience that she was disabled, she needed  to find ways to talk about it so that she  would be heard, and she needed to take care  of herself.  Some show members approved of her action, but others have never offered an apology for their disapproval or indeed indicated  that they understood her situation in any  way.  "I had the sense that they didn't care if  they had a corpse moving with them, as long  as I was with them."  Another difficult aspect of having an invisible disability is recognizing and validating your experiences and feelings to yourself. It can be very difficult to take a condition seriously if no one around you does.  But if a woman denies the problem, she may  well be denying the need to look after herself and become as well as possible. Especially with conditions as variable and inconsistent as most hidden disabilities, such as  a mental condition or a food allergy, this is  very important to recognize.  Often you need strong faith in yourself to  make changes in your life especially when  everyone else around you is doing something different. A birthday cake can become  a traumatic experience when wheat or can  stop your breathing or when invited to a  potluck at your house someone is sure to ask  if they have to bring "weird" food, meaning what you normally eat. Educating the  able-bodied can be as frustrating as it is for  women to try and educate men about sexism, or women of colour to educate white  women about racism.  Even in the disabled community there is a  need for education as Eunice's experience at  the DAWN conference showed. DAWN has  set an example by deciding to raise awareness amongst themselves by writing articles  and letters for publication in their newsletter and elsewhere.  Awareness alone is not enough. The  women's movement must make many more  changes if we wish to be accessible to all  women. A broader range of experiences  can only strengthen the movement, and all  women have something to contribute and a  right to take part.  As Donimo says, "I have a right to have  access to women's politics and culture, and  not suffer for three days after. I need to be  able to take part and I don't want to pay for  women's culture with piercing headaches."  KINESIS HEALTH.  /^^^%%^^^%^^^  by Lori Rudland  AIDS  Is syphilis the primary factor?  AIDS is a disease that demands our attention. Although it is not spreading as  fast as early, highly-inflated, estimates predicted, it is still expected to take millions of  lives worldwide. In North America over two-  thirds of the victims are homosexual men,  so that, in the early days, AIDS became  derisively known as the gay plague. But it  has reached epidemic proportions in Africa,  here it has always affected the heterosexual population.  A handful of researchers and doctors in  North America claim syphilis is a primary  factor in the spread of AIDS. The conservative medical establishment is extremely resistant to this possibility. But several factors combine to indicate that people with  AIDS, who also had syphilis, may have died  through improper diagnosis and treatment.  Moreover, doctors who rely on blood  serum tests are not being informed that  the tests produce false negatives in patients  whose immune systems are severely suppressed, i.e. AIDS patients.  In North America, Dr. Kirby Stewart, a  family physician in California, claims that  people who are dying of AIDS have likely  been victims of syphilis. "It is the opportunistic infections that kill patients with  AIDS. Not everyone who is dying of ADDS  has syphilis. But enough do that I think  syphilis is probably the primary source of  morbidity—the ongoing disabling disease  process—in people who are dying of ADDS."  Stewart insists that all patients with  chronic immunosuppression should be carefully evaluated. "I don't understand where  all the controversy is coming from. It's just  good medicine, not a big medical breakthrough."  When the percentages of people dying of  AIDS who had recurring syphilis are compared to the number of AIDS patients who  are currently doing well, Stewart claims the  picture is striking. "The ones who are doing well tend to be the ones who don't have  syphilis."  Research physiologist and information  scientist, Joan McKenna agrees. She identified a possible AIDS-syphilis connection  several years ago and then undertook extensive surveys of the male homosexual population in the U.S. McKenna concludes that  AIDS results from an immune system battered by a history of chronic inflammatory conditions, in particular syphilis, in  conjunction with excessive prescription and  recreational drug use.  In her researches of the African AIDS epidemic, particularly in Ruanda, Uganda, and  northeastern Zaire, Mckenna found that the  population, already suffering from severe  malnourishment, had been devastated by  rampaging, untreated syphilis for decades.  If it is true that syphilis is the primary  factor linked to the spread of AIDS and  the death of its victims, then recent statistics are more frightening than many suspect. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control (CDC) from Atlanta, Ga., report a  32 percent increase in syphilis for most  of 1987 when compared to the same period in 1986. Women and heterosexuals  recorded the greatest increases. Although  Canadian figures did not follow this trend,  New York is experiencing an epidemic of  syphilis with numbers surging above 100  percent increases.  Penicillin, the wonder drug, was supposed to have taken care of syphilis, so  what went wrong? European doctors have  been arguing for years that syphilis is under  treated in North America. Standard treatment is one injection of 2.4 million units  of penicillin G benzathine. Much higher  dosages of penicillin are administered in  And the penicillin used in North America  doesn't cross the blood/brain barrier but, in  its final stages, syphilis does. Also, timing is  a critical component of treatment. Syphilis  can be killed only when its replicating, but  otherwise has been observed swimming actively in concentrated penicillin.  posi's sarcoma lesions, they immediately assume AIDS or ARC (AIDS-related complex). It borders on malpractice to not carefully evaluate all AIDS patients for concurrent infections." But Stewart notes that evaluation is not easy, because some of the  symptoms are so similar.  For McKenna, the real issue is to go after  the physician's belief system, to take the  validity of such tests out of their hands.  "Now you have to be physicians again  and look at symptoms. You have to take  biopsies and do lymph node analysis. If it  looks like syphilis, quacks like syphilis, it  just might be syphilis.  parts of Europe for longer periods of time.  Misdiagnosis is another common occurrence with syphilis. Numerous studies confirm that the disease called the "great imitator" has been called just about anything. In  fact, the symptoms that doctors currently  identify with AIDS are identical to symptoms of syphilis.  Stewart says, "The problem with the  medical community is that if a person develops swollen lymph nodes, diarrhoea, or Kar-  McKenna states that the overuse of prescription drugs has masked syphilis symptoms, by indirectly treating it but not eliminating it. So that syphilis may explode  months or years later in an advanced condition which presents itself like AIDS.  To confirm diagnosis of syphilis, many  doctors rely on serological blood tests. But  the standard tests, such as those administered by the VD Clinic in Vancouver, can  only detect antibodies manufactured by the  body as a defence to syphilis. In patients  whose immune system is chronically suppressed, which is the defining feature of  AIDS, antibodies may not be manufactured  because the person's immune system is too  weak to respond. The tests yield a false negative result, but many doctors remain unaware of this possibility.  According to McKenna, "Diagnosis of  syphilis has become a serological finding,  nothing to do with the symptoms presented  by the patient. Given standard signs for  secondary syphilis—infectious chancre and  rash—the doctor will believe the test rather  than the patient." She calls it a "technological bind."  For McKenna, the real issue is to go after the physician's belief system, to take  the validity of such tests out of their hands.  "Now you have to be physicians again and  look at symptoms. You have to take biopsies  and do lymph node analyses. If it looks like  syphilis, quacks like syphilis, it just might  be syphilis."  In Vancouver, Dr. Hugh Jones, VD clinic  physician, was asked if physicians requesting syphilis tests were warned about the  possibility of false negatives. He answered,  "No." If the tests show nothing, the attending physician simply receives a report  of "negative." When asked why physicians  weren't warned, Jones said the VD clinic follows the CDC guidelines. The CDC guidelines do not warn of false negatives with  compromised immune systems.  Within a few months, McKenna reports,  this situation will be changed. One manufacturer of syphilis test kits, Miles Laboratories, is sufficiently concerned that it is  rewriting its package inserts. Others will be  forced to follow their example. Presumably  VD clinics, like our own, will also be forced  to warn physicians about false negatives._  Whether or not syphilis turns out to be  the major co-factor in the progression of  ADDS, failing to detect syphilis is a critical  diagnostic error. On its own syphilis is a serious disease. But when coupled with AIDS,  an acceleration effect has been observed, so  that the disease can progress with lightening speed to neurosyphilis.  High-dosage courses of penicillin treatment have been reported to improve the  health of AIDS patients. Stewart says that  one of his patients has only two lesions  of twenty-four when treatment began, with  no new opportunistic diseases. But Stewart  cautions that penicillin is not the answer, it  is not even a quick fix, although it can save  lives.  In West Germany two doctors have  treated patients with millions of units of  penicillin over extended periods of time. All  are reported to be clinically asymptomatic.  In one case, a patient's AIDS dementia was  reversed within a week. Like Stewart, the  West German doctors believe penicillin is  not a "curative", it only puts the disease  into remission. And, some patients could be  too ill to respond.  One more spectre looms on the syphilis  horizon. In New York City, the new wave  of syphilis is reported to be more inflamed  than was seen in the past. McKenna wonders if the North American population may  not be chemically distorted due to the excessive use of prescription drugs, all of which  suppress the immune system.  Stewart warns that a new disease is  being created—recurrent syphilis in an  immuno-compromised host. "We don't even  know what these symptoms are. All the  textbooks are written for patients who  contract syphilis but who have a non-  compromised immune symptom."

KINESIS  Apr. 88 15 Arts  by Maura Volante  Canadian composers  Radio series  a first  "There are lots of women composing  in Canada and there always have been,"  said Ina Dennekamp, local musicologist and  broadcaster. This is the starting point of  her new project, and the end result will  be a series of radio documentaries on these  women, from the mid-nineteenth century up  to the present day. Dennekamp has received  a year-long Canada Council Explorations  grant to travel all over Canada, researching the past and interviewing contemporary  composers and musicologists, focussing her  efforts on the field of "classical" or "serious"  music.  "I always want to put those words in quotation marks," she said, "because we don't  really have the language to define it. All I  know is that it's not pop music, it's not jazz  and it's not folk. It's a really fuzzy line, but  I have to draw it somewhere."  Dennekamp, who has for the past several  years produced a weekly radio show on Vancouver Cooperative Radio called "Women  of Note," is in a good position to begin this  work, having collected music and information on the topic for years.  It's hard to say where I get all of my  junk," she said. "I have an entire file cabinet full of bits and snippets here and  there. I network with other members of the  International Congress of Women in Music, which is basically American, but they  try to be international. I go through the  files at the Canadian Music Centre, a wonderful resource here in Vancouver. There's  Aaron Cohen's "International Encyclopedia of Women Composers," with over 3,500  names in the first edition and another edition coming out soon. And I save magazine  articles, concert programs etc.  So Dennekamp has a lot of information  to begin with, but she's very excited about  the research possibilities in front of her,  and says she'll probably come out of it "a  changed person, after I find out what's going on out there." The response from peo  ple she has contacted so far has been overwhelmingly positive.  "Everybody is absolutely overjoyed this  is happening, because it's never been done  before. This is the first time that this large  a body of information on Canadian women  composers, whether it's contemporary or  historical, has ever been put together in  some form. Everybody's saying 'Yah! Good  for you! I'll be happy to collaborate, I'll  send you the work ... ' and all that kind of  stuff."  For instance, Dennekamp wrote to a  woman named Minuetta Kessler, who is  from Calgary but now lives in Boston, explaining that she didn't expect to be able  to do an interview with her, but she would  like to include Kessler in the history.  "She wrote back," said Dennekamp, "and  she was thrilled! She said, 'I am so happy  that someone still recognizes me as a Canadian composer. I've been rejected by so  many Canadians because I don't live there  anymore. But I go back to my hometown  of Calgary every year and replenish myself  with the beauty of the Canadian landscape,  and then I go back to Boston and write music during the winter.' She was actually willing to come all the way to Vancouver to be  interviewed for the project."  Another encouraging response came from  Valerie Verity King in Montreal, who, to  Dennekamp's delight, has written a master's thesis on nineteenth century Canadian  women composers. She said, "I was floored  when I heard that! I haven't seen it yet, but  I'm going to get it." And King's teacher,  Elaine Keillor, a recitalist and musicologist,  dug up a copy of the first extant piece of  music written by a Canadian woman, dating from the mid-nineteenth century.  Dennekamp has been busy so far writing about seventy letters to women across  the country and in the United States, tracking down women like Kessler, who have left  the country but still consider themselves  Canadian. Another category of composers  she'll document is those she calls "imports  Women composers felt so disadvantaged in their quest for recognition that they  formed their own Association of Canadian Composers in 1980. This photo from  the association's first year shows four prominent members (I to r) Ann Southam,  Norma Beecroft. Maggie Burston and Alexina Louie.  and transplants, women born elsewhere who  at some point have made their homes in  Canada."  For example, she wants to include the  story of a woman named Sophie Carmen Eckhardt-Grammate. Explained Dennekamp, "She was born in Russia and  moved to Paris at a young age. She lived  all over Europe, and was well known as  a composer in the 30's and 40's. Then in  1954 she married Ferdinand Eckhardt and  moved to his home in Winnipeg. So until her  death in 1974, she wrote music in Canada.  She wrote symphonies and other works on  a large scale, which are all recorded. So I've  written to her husband, whose house is like  a museum of Sophie's stuff."  Not all women composing in this country  have the advantage of prior fame elsewhere,  however. One of the biggest problem facing  women composers today is getting their music performed.  "It is a problem," admitted Dennekamp.  "It's one of the things that composers are  up against all the time. You can't grow  and learn about your music if you cannot  hear it performed. It's not like being a visual artist, where you create a painting, you  hang it up, and it's there. A piece of music  has to be performed. Each and every time it  becomes an new creation—where the composers leave off, the performing body takes  over. There aren't enough works by women  composers being performed anywhere in the  country.  If younger children were exposed to more  Canadian music for one thing, contemporary music for another, including works by  women, they, as the audiences of the future, would be more likely to attend these  things. But large orchestras are in trouble  these days, and administrators are not keen  on doing new things because they need audiences. If audiences aren't trained ..."  The problems women are having with  performances have also sparked fantasies for  Dennekamp of getting involved in concert  production to showcase work by women.  And though she sees that as a long term  project, she'll hopefully get started on it as  part of her current work, with a concert  next spring by local soprano Sandra Browning. Dennekamp's idea is to design a retrospective program of some of the songs she  will be finding in her research, which she  can then tape to form part of her documentary series. She would also like to produce  a similar concert of piano works.  The vocal and piano forms have tended  to be more accessible to women of historic  times than other combinations of instruments, which is the most obvious difference,  in Dennekamp's observation, between the  early work by women and by men. Now  there is more flexibility in forms open to  women, though economics still may be a factor for some women's choices of instrumentation. "If you write work for small chamber  groups you're going to have that more readily performed than you are a symphony," remarked Dennekamp.  As to whether or not there is a "woman's  aesthetic", or a recognizable difference in  contemporary compositions by women and  men, she said, "It will always be a question.  It's something I intend to ask of all the composers and I'm sure I'm going to get a real  hot debate on it, which is great. Myself, I've  gone back and forth on it so many times.  It's not so much that you listen to a piece of  music and say, 'Aah, a woman wrote that.'  It is more that a woman has a different experience in the world, and she brings that  experience to her composition."  One of the aspects of contemporary composition that fascinates Dennekamp is its  diversity. "You're getting everything.!" she  said. "You still have composers who are  considered to be of the avant-garde, like  Barbara Pentland, who turned seventy this  year, and is a highly respected Canadian  composer. She has always written n  sparse, avant-garde material and continues  to do so.  "But as well as that you have people  like Jean Coulthard, who turned eighty this  year. She writes more what you might call  accessible music. And then there's electro-  acoustic and electronic music, with composers such as Micheline Coulomb-St. Mar-  coux in Quebec (who unfortunately died  quite young of a brain tumour) and Susan  Frykberg, working here in Vancouver. But  it's happening all at once. It's not that people are so much into styles, but that peoph  have found where they're comfortable. You  have this great simultaneity of styles going  on and audiences fit in where they're comfortable.  "On the show, 'Women of Note', I play  everything I can get my hands on. I feel that  a lot of my role is an educational one. What  I try to present is what's available. It's all  valid, it's all important, and the whole idea  of having the program and the project is to  reintroduce the idea that women have always been there."

Allison's poetry Intense and unflinching  by Betsy Warland  THE UNRAVELLING  by Gay Allison  Williams-Wallace Publishers  Toronto, 1987, 80 pages.  I want to write about women  who live in fragmented lives  Gay Allison and I met in Toronto in  1975. Gay came to the first feminist writers support group which I organized. We  immediately recognized one another and  became friends and co-conspirators and  worked together for several years on Toronto Women's Writing Collective projects  and the 1983 Women and Words conference.  Through the years we have made different choices in our intimate lives and our formal approaches to writing, yet our love and  support of each other has endured, fuelling  our companion visions of the urgent need  for the feminine in this patriarchal world.  Gay's instinct is to refuse the fragmentation  of the feminine. A writer shaped by the 60's,  she continues to believe that poetry has the  power to derail our thinking and retell the  world—as it actually is and as it can be.  women who fear open windows  Allison writes about our woman-fears,  the staring out of, the opening and jumping,  and the looking back from the other side.  You recognize yourself, your mother, your  friends, and the girls and infants in your life.  women who fear men  who fear husbands  or brothers or uncles  I want to write about women  who have lived by the script  they did not write  You recognize the rage: the missing nine  year old girl whose body is found "in a re  frigerator later that week"; the bizarre moments of clarity which change your life forever.  "My lover threw a bowl at me  /my favourite yellow bowl  the Chinese one with flowers that swirled  through the air rice all over my hair  this is like my wedding day she thought  /only  no one to catch the flowers"  And you witness Allison rewriting her  script. About her baby daughter; about her  husband who risks "love with its heavy  weight" and rises early with his waking  daughter, reading  "this is a bird this is a flower  /this is a tree  that's a mountain and this is the ocean  shhh  don't wake your mother"  The infant daughter who has "chosen the  largest room in our house ... the walls filled  with photos of writers & poets ... Outside your window the wasps have built their  nest. It's been there all summer, waiting.  The morning stirs them loose, crazy for your  smell."  I want to write about women  who are not longer secret  agents in another world  Allison so tenderly unlocks her relationship with her dead mother. And this process  seems to open the way for her to encounter  several other deaths of intimates in her life.  Her claiming of the presence of these people,  and her embracing of the knowledge of how  they can inform her living, is very moving.  Especially since we as feminists have dealt  so little with death in our writing. As in the  rest of her work, these poems weave and in  tegrate back into the writer's and reader's  imaginations. Becoming present. Taking up  space with our vision and knowing.  I want to write about women  who love women  women who know them:  who can't imagine freedom  in a man's world  but live in it  Allison's intense living "in it" and unmitigated scoring of this living provokes the  imaginary of a women-present world. It is a  world in which she is inextricably interconnected with everything. Although this can  often be horrifying, it is also a source of generative power. This woman will not be written out! She will write herself, woman, in as  quickly as she has been unravelled out. In  fact, through the process of her writing, the  unravelling becomes the very medium of her  words. Allison is one of our most evocative  and unflinching poets.  This is Gay Allison's second book of  poetry. She has been an active feminist  writer for the past thirteen years with the  Toronto women's Writing Collective, Fireweed, Women and Words and more recently  as the Poetry Editor of Waves. She is currently the Fiction Editor of Canadian Fo-  Gay Allison will be reading from her  new book for the first time in Vancouver this May.

KINESIS .•5^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\  Arts  The new Ms —  gardening tips galore  by  Wendy   Frost  and   Michele Valiquette  Ms. has always had more in common  with glossy mainstream women's mags than  with the grassroots publications of the  Women in Print movement. Those of you  who hoped that the recent takeover by new  publishers might improve things can stop  holding your breath. The "new, improved"  Ms. is neither.  Late last fall Ms. editors Gloria Steinem  and Patricia Carbine announced plans to  sell the magazine to John Fairfax Ltd., the  second largest media group in Australia.  They claimed that an "injection of new  money" and a shift to for-profit status were  necessary responses to years of losses.  Carbine and Steinem welcomed the  takeover: "Ms. is ready to assume the larger  role that a corporate form and real financial  support can give," said Steinem. Fairfax's  plans for their "larger role" include raising  the magazine's circulation from the current  480,000 to 650,000 over the next five years  and making it more attractive to advertisers.  As Sandra Yates, president of Fairfax  publications US, put it: "The magazine  needs to be repositioned in the advertisers'  minds." How will this be achieved? Apparently by watering down what many women  consider an already diluted feminism. New  editor-in-chief Anne Summers said in a recent interview, "We're certainly going to be  less strident, less didactic." In the immortal  words of Ms.' past: No comment.  The Fairfax Ms. hit the stands in February of this year. The changes include a wider  format, shorter articles, regular monthly  columns—Humour, Sports, Personal Finances, Personal Appearances (read "fashion"), and Gardening. Newsday described it  as "more sprightly", "no longer humorless  and single subject." But our sense, after a  careful reading of the first three issues, is  that what the changes really do is intensify  the contradictions that Ms. has always embodied.  Since 1972, Ms. has presented itself as  the official face of American feminism. And  it is true that over the years Ms. has provided information and analysis useful to  women. Important feminist writers—Alice  Walker, Barbara Ehrenreich, Ellen Willis,  Adrienne Rich among them—have used Ms.  as a forum to reach a broad audience. But,  The image of successful womanhood that  emerges has little to do with the concerns  of most feminist activists, or the lives of  most women.  the overall message of the magazine remains  one of upwardly mobile, "piece of the pie"  feminism: you too can be president of a corporation, or even the United States. The advertising has always underscored this: expensive cars and alcohol, insurance, stereos,  credit cards, and more recently, makeup and  lingerie. The image of successful womanhood that emerges has little to do with the  concerns of most feminist activists, or the  lives of most women.  In the new Ms., women's struggles are  even more individualized. There's less analysis and overview, more "one woman's  story." The April issue, for instance, features a personal account of a television  producer suffering from multiple sclerosis  While her battle with the disease can only  be lauded, the article obscures the reality  most disabled women's lives: those who  don't have her economic independence, her  high-profile job, or a similarly supportive  partner.  Well known feminist theorists like Kate  Millett, Marge Piercy and Susan Brown  miller are turning up in the revamped mag  not with fresh feminist insights, but with  gardening tips. What's next? Discussions of]  racism and pornography replaced by tuna  casserole recipes and household hints. It's  all too close for comfort to the media myth  of the post-feminist woman, who can affon I  to be feminine" again now that the struggle's over.  Other disturbing features in the first few  issues: a photo essay on Moscow women that  reproduces every right wing stereotype o'  Soviet life you're likely to have come across  an approving portrait of a woman highly  placed in the Reagan government; a flui:  piece on the fiftieth anniversary of nylon  stocking; and, of course, the usual ads sug  gesting that feminists are simply one more  consumer group.  One good sign—editor-in-chief Summers  reports that not all readers are happy with  the madeover Ms.. They've received many  critical responses. Our question is: At what  point do the negative effects of this careerist  and class-biased version of feminism outweigh any possible benefits. To put it another way—can Ms. magazine any longer  be of use to the women's movement?  If you're in any doubt about where Ms.  is headed, take a look at Fairfax's other  new North American publishbg venture—  Sassy. This mag currently rates full page  ads in Ms. It's aimed at a teenage audience  and is modelled on the Australian publica  tion Dolly. The premiere issue squeezes a  few cutesy and condescending articles between the fashion and makeup ads that fil  most of the magazine's pages. It's hard to  imagine how any young woman who read  this regularly would ever figure out that the  women's movement existed, much less how  to become part of it. The response of one  teenager we showed Sassy to: "You paid for  this?"  All of this raises one final question: Can  feminism ever be fit within the context o[  mainstream, profit-making publishing and  not be compromised?  Late Flash: The New York Times of  Friday, March 18, 1988 reports that Ms.  is changing hands once again. Since Fairfax went private last August, it's been shedding assets, including its American properties. Sandra Yates and Anne Summers, the  magazines two top executives, are currently  negotiating to buy both Ms. and Sassy.  Could a "new" look be in the offing? Watch  for further developments.

Under the umbrella of the recently formed Vancouver  MayWorks Society, over 40 public events are  being organized for the First Annual May-  Works Festival, May 1st through 8th.  MayWorks brings together a variety of  artistic interests in the celebration of culture and working life, in the tradition of  similar May festivals in Paris, Berlin, Glasgow and Toronto.  The intent of MayWorks is to build a  strong bridge between working people, the  general public, and the arts. May works will  accomplish this through an eclectic lineup of  music, theatre, visual arts shows, film and  video screenings, writing workshops, poetry  readings and will explore a wide range of  labour-oriented themes.  The Festival is being designed to make  the arts accessible and meaningful to people. Admission prices will be low, and public  input and participation will be key components of May Works. A series of 'open stages'  are being offered to performers and writers  looking for an opportunity to share their  works.  A song-writing contest and a 'Blue Pencil  Cafe' workshop for writers will also be featured. Roundtable discussions on such topics as 'Pay for Cultural Work?!', and the  'History of B.C. Artists at Work', will provide further food for thought.  Presentations will include: a look at the '  history of B.C. women in the workplace; '  cabarets, with a special evening with singer  Joelle Rabu; folk music and work songs  by and about B.C. workers; Punjabi theatre presented in English; Katari Taiko and  Kokoro Dance; and the colourful recollections of the 'On to Ottawa Trek' show.  Much of the MayWorks activity will centre around Commercial Drive venues, including the I.W.A. Hall, La Quena, and the  Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Opening  May Day festivities in the East End will  be followed by an evening concert with the  band DOA at the Commodore.  Visual arts exhibitions will be held in  downtown Vancouver locations, and at the  Women In Focus Gallery on Broadway.  Music, work writing, poetry readings, and  video presentations will also take place at  the C.A.LM.A.W. Hall in New Westminister.  Zoe Landale is one of the many writers who will perform during the MayWorks.  Landale is a founding member of the Vancouver Industrial Writers Union and is  well known for her poetry and short fiction.   MayWorks: art at work for the entire  community.  A full schedule of events will be available in April from the May Works office;  phone 824-8821.  MayWorks is being held in cooperation with the  Confederation of Cana  dian Unions, the B.C. Federation oj\  Labour; the B.C. Teachers' Federation; the Maritime Labour Centre;  the Vancouver Folk Music Festival;  the Vancouver Folk Song Society; the  Vancouver Industrial Writers' Union,  Video In; Women in Focus; and othei  arts, labour and community groups.  Status  from pg. 5  velop their own membership codes, outlining criteria as to who may become members  and therefore share benefits and responsibilities.  Like the promise of sexual equality for  Native women, this move toward autonomy was initially well-received by the Native community, but it soon proved to be an  empty promise.  "Speaking for myself, when they threw in  the part about bands determining their own  band membership, it was like throwing a  wrench into the works," said Gloria Nicholson of the Professional and Native Women's  Association.  "Because for one thing a lot of bands were  not prepared—especially on small, isolated  reserves—to go through the process of determining band members."  In the two years alloted by the federal  government for bands to complete their  membership codes, only half of the 592  bands have done so. Furthermore, developing these codes at the same time as dealing with thousands of reinstated women has  created utter confusion on the reserve. Returning women are often forced to bear the  brunt of this confusion.  "Since the controversial band membership provisions of Bill C-31 were introduced,  a few bands have stopped providing these  services to newly reinstated women and  their children," reports CACSW. Tor example, women have been denied fishing licenses; their children have been refused admittance to reserve schools; medical services  have been denied..."  In Alberta, the Sawbridge Band, reputedly one of the wealthiest bands hi Canada,  has passed a residency by-law which may  prohibit reinstated persons, mostly women,  who gained automatic band membership  under Bill C-31, from residing on the reserve, thus effectively preventing them from  remaining as band members.  Neither are reserve women given much of  a role in developing the membership codes  and in many examples they are even denied  voting rights on then reserve.  As Sherry Clark of the United Native Nations (UNN) explains, conflict on the reserve results from lack of education around  rights and obligations. "People have to consider all sides ... If you're confused, that  makes it hard on the band and then the  band thinks you're really a pain ... It takes  time to explain what's happening for people, even status people don't know what's  available to them."  Another harmful effect of Bill C-31, Clark  said, is the creation of "8 or 9 different  groups of Indians" which adds confusion  and creates greater inequality. "The bottom  fine is you do still have aboriginal people  without band membership, status with no  band membership, status with band membership off reserve, status with band membership on reserve ... whereas there used  to be only two groups of Indians: status and  non-status."  Furthermore, resulting from the 6(1) and  6(2) distinctions there is a fear that, in the  long term, this rule will limit the number of  Indians who are eligible to be registered under the Indian Act.  "If I were in 6(2) I wouldn't like that  they'd still dictate to me who I should and  shouldn't marry, in order to keep my identity," said Clark. "And that's the bottom  line: identity. So they actually haven't ended  sexual discrimination ... 6(2) is still enfranchisement only with different terminology."  According to the CACSW study, Indian  marriage statistics from 1965 to 1985 show  that about half of Indian marriages are between status people; the other half are between a status man or woman and a non  status person. Indian men tend to marry-  out as frequently as do women. Ii this trend  continues, the proportion of Indians who  will be able to transmit their status will decrease from generation to generation.  A House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development is presently examining the effects  of Bill C-31 and expects to make its report  to Indian Affairs Minister Bill McKnight in  June.  "The government has let the whole process degenerate into a bureaucratic nightmare," said Jean Gleason, acting president of the Native Women's Association of  Canada. "It is becoming obvious that the  main motive behind Bill C-31 was to get the  government off the hook concerning the legalized discrimination that was found in the  Indian Act and not to correct the wrongs of  past injustices."  The UNN says there is a seven year wait for  some applicants. Out of nearly 10,000 applicants in B.C. less than 500 individuals have  had their status reinstated.

DREAM  FUTON  1420 COMMERCIAL DRIVE 254-5012  KINESIS  Apr. 88 19 Commentary  by Carol Read  Adult sexual abuse survivors often suffer  further abuse in therapy, concur three Vancouver feminist counsellors.  "When survivors grow up, some of them  go on to be offended by psychiatrists," says  Pamela Sleeth, who has worked with survivors for seven years.  "First of all, you must recognize abuse,"  warns Sleeth. "The abused tend to blame  themselves."  Sexual abuse of a child can be: any unwanted touching by an adult or older child;  any sexual overtures or behaviour by an  adult whether verbal or physical; coercing  the child to act as a caregiver to the parent;  Survivors rights in therapy  At the Vancouver Incest and Sexual  Abuse Centre (VISAG) some of the clients  were molested by previous therapists, says  Louise Doyle, a counsellor who organizes  groups. This abuse of therapy is also reported by Sleeth and Dr. Naida Hyde, the  director of counselling services at Simon  Fraser University.  A 1973 American study of 460 physicians  showed that five to thirteen percent of them  "engaged in erotic behaviour with patients,  including intercourse," writes Hyde, in another American study of freshman medical students, Hyde cites "25 percent of the  respondents believed intercourse with patients could be appropriate under the right  circumstances if the doctor was 'genuine'  and 'authentic' "  According to Hyde, "Relationships with  benign authority figures, such as physicians,  therapists, and teachers have a tendency  to become sexualized for adult survivors,"  writes Hyde. "However, these sexual feelings and the seductive behaviour that may  result are not the expression of her adult  sexuality but rather are her needy sexually  abused 'child-self's' feelings ... for a physician or other professional helper to change  roles and respond as a lover is to repeat the  and treating the child like a wife or mistress.  Even if the child is seduced she has been  raped—and the adult is entirely at blame.  All sexual abuse is a betrayal of the child's  trust and a denial of the child's right to be  nurtured, loved, and respected.  The therapist-client relationship repeats  the parent-child one: the client is in a position of vulnerability and neediness. Adult  survivors are especially vulnerable because  they have not yet learned to defend their  boundaries. They might be unsure of what  behaviour they should and should not expect from a therapist.  Abuse of therapy can be: not listening;  not respecting the client's intelligence, values, and autonomy; rudeness; mocking or  attacking the client; disbelieving the client;  minimizing the abuse; blaming the client in  any way for the abuse; focusing therapy on  the therapist; and sexualizing the therapist-  client relationship in a covert or physical  way.  incestuous events of the survivor's early life  and to 'orphan' the woman, leaving her betrayed and bereft of healing and support."  An expert on adult survivors, Hyde emphasizes again and again the client's profound neediness in therapy. As a child, the  survivor's needs were not met while she par-  ented her immature parents. The survivor  is often ashamed of her neediness and feels  it will drive others away, yet she may get  much of her self-esteem from her acute sensitivity in meeting others' needs.

It is this inner child, not the outer facade, the therapist must address for healing  to occur.  In our culture, men often do not learn to  meet the needs of women, so male therapists  may be unaware of taking advantage of a  female survivor's acute sensitivity towards  them. Even female therapists may enjoy the  survivor's expert attention, which is only a  parody of a culturally-desired female trait.  the client to find another therapist." Hyde  warns that some therapists may be uncomfortable with sexual abuse because they  have not resolved their own; Sleeth points  out there are offenders who do the work,  therapists who molest their own children.  A therapist may also minimize the  client's abuse because the statistics are so  high. One in four girls will be sexually  abused before the age of eighteen. Yet no  matter how many others are abused, each  survivor needs to work through her own  feelings and have them taken seriously.  To be effective with survivors, a therapist  needs to be a feminist who has done her own  therapy and who gets her needs met outside  of the office. Hyde believes that to be a feminist one must be a woman. Although men  can be sensitive to feminist issues and sexual abuse, the actual work of healing should  be with a woman, she believes. "It's taken  me a long time to come to that."  Perhaps because sexual abuse is so pervasive and is but an extreme of society's  treatment of women, the damage of abuse  was denied until recently. "In 1980-81 in  Vancouver, we started to know, then later  come to believe that childhood sexual abuse  is rampant and has been for some time.  All time, I would say," says Pamela Sleeth.  She first learned of sexual abuse when she  was director of Vancouver Transition House.  There, she estimates, 60 to 70 percent of the  women were abused as children.  Most sexual abuse is by close relatives,  the three counsellors agree. The shame associated with incest plus family pressures can  lead to more denial by the survivor, her family, and the professionals. "The dread of incest in our culture" results in "professionals  turning a 'blind eye' to its signs and symptoms in their patients," writes Hyde.  Therapists may disbelieve their clients.  Some therapists still rationalize the terror  and pain of the survivor's memories with  Freudian theory: the survivor has a "repressed desire to have sex with father." This  is a deep betrayal of woman's reality.  "The freudian thing still exists," comments Doyle, "but more common is minimization, the reluctance on the therapist's  part in dealing with it. The therapist does  not own up to his own discomfort and free  Denial and minimization may even lead  to the adult survivor's never discussing oi  acknowledging the abuse at all. Hyde estimates half her clients in private practice  were abused, but most of them were unaware of the abuse when entering therapy.  Adult survivors enter therapy for depression, poor relationships, vague physical problems without a physical cause or  a numbness and lack of pleasure in life.  Survivors often have sexual difficulties. The  therapist needs to be aware of the possibility of abuse, asking questions but allowing  the client the safety of dealing with it when  she is ready.  Other survivors enter therapy when a life  event, such as marriage, the birth of a child,  or the discovery of a daughter's abuse triggers memories of their own trauma. Often a  survivor is not ready to deal with her abuse  until she is in her thirties or forties and has  gained enough ego strength to look at her  childhood in a different way.  A good therapist is sensitive to the enormous effect breaking the silence around  abuse has on the survivor's life. The survivor is struggling to find her own voice;  she is destroying her poor self-concept, the  myth she has created of her family, and perhaps some relationships with family members.  A good therapist will accept the rage,  long hidden, the survivor feels towards her  family. By expressing and releasing her rage,  the survivor can cut her destructive emotional ties to her denying, abusive parents  and thus radically transform her current relationships. The survivor can learn to look  after herself and have her needs met, to gain  her own power.  Therapy needs to be a slow and gentle  process, its speed and focus dictated by the  client and what she feels ready for. Therapy  can take years, with possible breaks if the  client wants.  If an adult survivor feels she is not getting  what she needs from therapy, she might  sider discussing her concern with her therapist. If her therapist is abusive, she has the  right to report the therapist in order to protect other survivors. Certainly she should  leave and get the care and expertise she de-   VANCOUVER WOMEN'S   BOOKSTORE  Hours: Monday-Saturday  ll:00-5:30pm  684-0523  315 Cambie Street    Vancouver, B.C.

Being Pregnant is a collection of fifteen  women's reminiscences about their pregnancies. What I like most about the book  is that it confirms my suspicion that being  pregnant is something you do in the midst  of living. Women do it while working, fighting with their parents, raising other children, changing jobs, figuring out a relationship, moving, being ill, changing cultures—  anything.  All this is very reassuring to me because  I've never been pregnant or even close and  never wanted to be. (I read the book while  recovering from a hysterectomy and never  noticed the irony until someone else pointed  it out.) *  I've been told that my "monthly flow"  and my fertility were what made me a  woman.   Well  it   isn't  what  made  these  V  women, women. I recognized them as my  kind in many ways—strength when beaten,  harassed, manipulated, patronized; sensi-  bleness when their body changes were making them crazy or ill; paying attention to  relationships—what people are actually doing to and for each other. One woman says  she was quite taken by this man, Jack, until  she got pregnant by him. Then "One thing  I knew was that I had to get rid of Jack."  The book lets me in on another of  women's "secrets". Pregnancy—that mysterious, magical state. Just as I suspected,  pregnancy, like marriage, is magical for  some in some ways and for others it  is all mixed up with fear, uncertainty,  poverty, tiredness, crazy-feeling, trapped-  feeling, boredom, racism and sexism. Now  that sounds like my life.  Evelyn Battell  DAWN  critique  To: Canadian Women's Movement Archives  Thank you for your letter of Feb. 11,  1988.

We would suggest  you send it to other women's groups and  PROFESSORSHIP  IN WOMEN'S STUDIES  The women's studies program at SFU is seeking  a senior candidate with an outstanding  academic and /or professional record, for the  Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Professorship  in women's studies.  This will be a one year appointment, beginning  either in September 1989 or January 1990.  Applicants with a specialty in economics, math,  science or engineering are especially invited.  Applicants must be Canadian citizens or landed  immigrants, and must have appropriate  academic or professional qualifications.  Responsibilities will include teaching, public  lectures and community outreach.  Salary will be that of a senior scholar.  Candidates should send a curriculum vitae and the  names and addresses of three referees, no later than 15  June, 1988, to:  V. Strong-Boag, Coordinator  Women's Studies Program  Simon Fraser University  Burnaby, B.C. V5A 1S6  Phone: (604) 291-3593.  have included a copy of our mailing list with  the groups you may also have missed in your  first mailing checked.  We want you to be aware that, because  you have not asked a few simple questions  about accessibility in your questionnaire,  your computerized directory will be virtually useless to twelve to eighteen per cent  of Canadian women. Listings which do not  tell us if we can use that service aren't really very helpful and in fact may reinforce  our invisibility within the women's movement. We have consistently pressed for the  inclusion of accessibility under listings of  women's groups and services. Our Open  Letter to the Women's Movement which we  sent to you several years ago was quite explicit about this. And so we feel that once  again the mainstream women's movement  has excluded women with disabilities.  We hope you do better next time.  Yours sincerely,  Liz Stimpson  Chairperson, DAWN Toronto  Reader  insulted  Kinesis:  In response to Helen Forsey's letter "Sex  Trade" let's consider "conversation" efforts.  As a prostitute, I find Helen Forsey's  letter extremely insulting to all sex trade  workers. It's based once again on assumptions, I would like to clear them up.  • Prostitution is not about sexuality, it's  about   work,   economics   and   survival.  Dykes are sex trade workers too. Thirteen  percent of women have worked as prostitutes at least once in their lifetimes.  • Racism plays a major role in the sex  trade. Fifty percent of all sex trade workers on the street are women of colour in  Vancouver.  • Prostitution and pornography, the women working in these sex trades are there  because of oppression—sexism, racism,  class oppression and also face violence.  One out of four women are raped in our  lifetimes, prostitutes are raped on the average of ten times a year.  In order to start conversation with sex  trade workers, the feminist movement has  to make us welcome. If you seriously want  to educate yourself and other women about  prostitution start by reading books written  by sex trade workers {keeping in mind the  feminist movement is based on women's experience not assumption.)  Ask opportunist feminists (feminists  making money off women's oppression) if  they are taking direction or have set up any  accountability to sex trade workers. Challenge their theories. Particularly because  prostitution has become the "issue" of the  decade and the "issue" to write about.  Ask yourself why there isn't any sex trade  workers in your collectives, coffee houses,  workshops and demos.  And finally, quit blaming sex trade workers for men's sexism. Blaming one of the  most oppressed groups of women for men's  violence let's them (men) off the hook one  more time.
