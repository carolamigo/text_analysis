Well, we say "election" a lot this  issue so what's two (20?) more times Have ever noticed how you get up one day and  everyone's in a bad mood? So are you but you can't do anything to snap out of it. You go  to sleep at night and figure you'll feel better in the morning-usually you do...but a month  passes, you aren't feeling better and you figure something's wrong. Well, something is  wrong. There's nothing like an election to sour the mood...one more reminder of how the  state reinvents itself...  Globally, the women's movement has never been this strong or this organized. Yet  we're living in a world that's increasingly right-wing. We cannot afford any more economic,  social, political or physical assaults...we have to vote for the party that least tears us down.  No question. This federal election is critical because the issues are so urgent—we know it's  important to stop the NAFTA, the backlash against women, peoples of colour, immigrants,  the poor,...we need childcare, jobs, shelters, housing... Yet some women feel so little hope  that the only act of resistance they believe left to them is to not vote. When we vote, it's 'cos  we have to. No illusions, no disillusionment, now or after. Because we can't move a system  that doesn't recognize we exist, we can't afford any illusions about options we don't, have  never had We cannot afford to dwell on the bad days. We mustn't, can't stand still.  ... 'cos no matter what crawls out from under the rock after October 25th, the struggle will  go on. What we do now is has to lead to making our resistance more possible!  Speaking of crawling, Kim Campbell made her first and only appearance in her riding  of Vancouver Centre at the Walk for AIDS. Reports heard so far: Kim's staffers invited  Liberal candidate Hedy Fry and NDPer Betty Baxter to walk the ("non-partisan") walk with  Kim. Rumour has it Betty said: But I'm running and I don't think Kim can keep up; so Kim  walked, Hedy walked and Betty ran; there was boos for Campbell and lots o' heckling...  A cartoon we saw the other day has this car with a sign on its bumper that reads: "Honk  if you think they can be fooled again." A caricature of Kim stands beside it; she's honking  her horn and smiling that smile... OK, maybe you had to be there... Oh, you can be there...on  page 17.  Hey we're one of them that thinks Campbell's not going to win.. .oh, one of those chain-  rumours., .someone at Kinesis spoke with someone in the NDP in Vancouver who spoke with  someone in the NDP in Ottawa who has a cousin in the Tory campaign who said the Tories  are looking for another riding for Kim because they think she won't win in her Vancouver  Centre riding...  By the way, if you can get a copy, read the NAC Voter's Guide- it lays out federal  election issues better than anything we've seen out there.. .available at VSW, 301 -1720 Grant...  And read the election coverage on pages 11-17. Unfortunately we lost a chunk of party  platforms and women's issue developments on a computer as we went to press...the  computer didn't seem to want to swallow the Tory Party line... .but the commentaries helped  get debate going around the production room...  Speaking of the election coverage, Judy Rebick gives one of the fun-est lines we saw last  month in an interview in Canadian Dimension. Says Rebick in a callout: "My activism has  wrecked my sex life." Can we..? Nah, we can't relate...! Uhm.  Received some 'questions to ask your local candidate' drafted up by Vancouver's  December 9 Coalition, a lesbian and gay rights group: "When did you discover you are a  heterosexual? Do you think heterosexuality is genetic? Can we assume you are gay/lesbian?  What is tha t gold thing you are wearing on your finger?--do you think it is right to flaunt your  sexuality?" We figure we can ask other-than-politician types those questions too...  Actually there were quite a number of fun lines last month...someone climbed up a  building in Vancouver's West End late one night to correct a typo on a huge (expensive)  billboard that had Kim Campbell's smiling face and "Putting Vancouver at the Centre of  Things" on it. We think "Putting Vancouver at the Centre of Evil" was much more  appropriate. Then the local media picked it up, now everyone in BC knows Vancouver  Centre doesn't like Kim. They took the politically corrected poster down the next day; about  200 people in the streets booing.  It was quite a month for a number of reasons, some not so fun. Israel and Palestine  signed a peace treaty. Not once in the coverage (in Vancouver) have we seen mention of the  history of the struggles of the indigenous peoples of the land, or of the fact that thousands  and thousands of Palestinians have been killed, imprisoned, tortured, thrown into refugee  camps, exiled, had homes burned down, tear-gassed, beaten, denied jobs, denied water,  denied the right to grow olive trees...  Black lesbian feminist poet Dionne Brand was in town last month [see page ...]. In her  talk at the University of British Columbia, Brand told us about Audrey Smith, a tourist from  Jamaica. Audrey Smith was standing at the corner of Dufferin and Queen when cops pulled  up and accused her of carrying drugs. They made Audrey Smith get into the cop car. She told  them she didn't have any drugs on her; they could search her if they wanted. The cops made  Audrey Smith get out of the car and strip. Audrey Smith was strip-searched by two white  male cops on the corner of Dufferin and Queen in front of all the passers-by. They didn't find  any drugs. The cops then got back in their car and drove away laughing, leaving Audrey  standing naked on the corner of Queen and Spadina.  A week after Brand left town, Tlie Vancouver Sun printed a short piece on Audrey Smith.  Seems like the Toronto police leaked information about the investigation, and a top Jamaican  diplomat in Canada, Margarietta St. Juste, is furious. The cops told the Toronto Star that  Audrey Smith had stripped off her own clothes on the corner of Dufferin and Queen to  "embarass or intimidate police. Yeah right.  The day Brand told us the story of Audrey Smith, the local newspapers had reported the  election to British parliament of a member of the "rights-f or-whites" neo-nazi National Party  [see page 7). That day was also the first day of the trial of the man accused of the killing of  Cheryl Joe, an Aboriginal woman from the Downtown Eastside. ■  As we go to press, the BC Supreme Court has granted the federal government one more  adjournment (delay) "to prepare their defense" against Little Sisters' lesbian and gay  bookstore in Vancouver [see page 8].  A couple of last-minute notices as Kinesis goes to press: the Vancouver Status of  Women's/National Film Board's annual film series will take place in November.  There's an ant-NAFTA panel/presentation of sorts on October 6 called "NAFTA:  Nightmare on Your Street" billed as "scarier than Phantom; more misery than Les Miz; Two  Thousand Terrifying Pages!!" at the Vogue Theatre on 918 Granville Street, 7 pm. Maude  Barlow from Council of Canadians and NDP MP Dave Barrett will be on hand to tell you all  about NAFTA.  By the way, the Vancouver Status of Women wants all those women running around out  there with keys to VSW to know they finally changed the deadbolt so your keys don't work  anymore.  And finally, as we get closer to the time when the flats are taken to the printers., .our next  issue will go to press the morning after the elections (Campbell has no respect for feminist/  community publishing deadlines!) but a number of women have offered to watch the  results on TVs propped up in front of typewriters/computers so we'll have some postelection reading for you in the next issue.  And then again, there's always "As Kinesis Goes to Press"....  Oops. So much for that extro. Just heard there will be a Vancouver Centre All-  Candidates Meeting on women's issues on October 12, 7:30 pm at the Robson Square  Media Centre, Judge Magill Theatre. Invited guests are: Betty Baxter (NDP), Hedy Frye  (Liberals) and Kim Campbell. Word has it she might just show.. .[this updates the story on page  3].  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

See you again next month and enjoy  jumping into those piles of autumn leaves.  We know we will!  OCTOBER 1993 News  South Asian women protest sex selection ads:  Newspapers boycotted  by Agnes Huang  South Asian women in Vancouver are  leading the protest against the targeting of  their community by an American doctor  marketing sex selection services.  The Coalition of South Asian Women's  Organizations Against Sex Selection organized a boycott of four South Asian newspapers who refused to remove the ads of Dr.  John Stephens.  The Coalition groups include: India  Mahila (Women's) Association (IMA),  SAWAN (the South Asian Women's Action  Network), Samanta, Vancouver Sath Literary & Cultural Society, and Punjabi Women's Association.  The Coalition had tried repeatedly to  persuade the editors of The Link, Indo-Canadian Times, Sangharsh, and Hem Jyoti to stop  publishing the ads permanently before initiating the boycott action.  "Several members of the Coalition  phoned the newspapers; we sent them a  letter and followed it up with another phone  call, but they ignored our concerns," says  Harji Sangra of Vancouver Sath.  Stephens uses ultrasound scanning to  determine the sex of the foetus as early as 12  weeks into pregnancy at his clinics in Blaine,  Washingtonand Buffalo, New York. He also  provides medical information on abortion at  his clinics.  Although Stephens denies it, the Coalition says he is perpetuating discrimination  against women and promoting female foeticide. "Sex selection means son selection in a  male dominated society where women continue to be devalued. The preference for  male children is a universal phenomenon,"  says Sangra.  This is not the first time Stephens has  targeted South Asian women in Vancouver.  In 1990, similar ads appeared in The Link and  Indo-Canadian Times. After protests from  women, the newspapers pulled the ads.  Surjeet Kalsey, Samanta; Bal Dhaliwal, Punjabi Women's Association;  Chris Rahim, VSW (back row, l-r); Radhika Bhagat, SAWAN; Raminder  Dosanjh, IMA and Harji Sangra, Vancouver Sath (front row, l-r) at press  conference  Stephens has also used South Asian newspapers in Toronto to target the community  there.  The Coalition says Stephens is racist  and sexist in his deliberate targeting of the  South Asian community. "He's going on a  very strong stereotype that this community  wants the service," says Radhika Bhagat of  SAWAN.  "He is further entrenching the stereotype that it is only the South Asian community using these services."  The practice of sex selection is not inherent in South Asian cultures, says Raminder  Dosanjh of IMA. "Up until the time these ads  came out (in 1990), we had never heard of  these practices going on in the community.  These ads have actually created and perpetuated that need."  Joy Thompson of the BC Coalition for  Abortion Clinics (BCCAC) agrees. "The  profiteering from sex selection clinics is the  first step on a slippery slope towards the  commercializa tion of medical techniques tha t  in fact remove women's choice," says  Thompson.  Like the Coalition groups, BCCAC sees  sex selection as an issue of women's reproductive rights.  The organization is among a number of  feminist and anti-racist groups who support  the Coalition's boycott. Other groups include: National Action Committee on the  Status of Women, Vancouver Status of  Women, Canadian Association of Sexual  Assault Centres, and BC Organization to  Fight Racism.  On September 13, the Coalition and the  supporting groups held a press conference  to launch the boycott and pressure federal  political parties to respond with their positions on the boycott. The Coalition's demands are that political parties, local candidates, individuals and businesses stop ad  vertising in the newspapers until they agree  to stop running Dr. Stephens' ad and publish a statement saying they will stop running the ad permanently.  BCCAC's Thompson applauded South  Asian women as the first coalition of women's organizations to target federal candidates on an issue "that will give a very clear  indication of what they think about women's equality and women's reproductive  rights."  The BC campaign offices of the New  Democratic Party, Liberals, and Conservatives all stated they were against sex selection and that they would urge party candidates to consider the issues and participate  in the boycott.  While all parties have said they are  strongly against sex selection as a "service,"  the Coalition has only received a written  statement from the NDP.  Dosanjh says the Coalition wants the  candidates "to take a stand on an ethical  basis and send a strong message that they  will not do business with those who knowingly and opportunistically continue to advertise female foeticide for their own financial gain."  Meanwhile, following the widespread  media coverage, the four South Asian newspapers used their pages to restate their refusal to pull the ads and to criticize the  position of the Coalition. On September 15,  the editor of The Link wrote a vicious attack  on the Coalition and individual members.  He accused the Coalition of damaging the  image of Indo-Canadian women.  The Indo-Canadian Times also issued a  press statement dismissing the Coalition for  pulling a media stunt and for having done  nothing to educate the community about the  issues. The Coalition has responded with  letters to the editors of each paper, which  have not been published.  See SEX SELECTION on page   9  Federal election '93:  Women's groups gear up  by Jackie Brown  The writ has been dropped and the  federal election campaign is on. With the  implementation of NAFTA and the erosion  of social programs at stake, local women's  groups, anti-poverty organizations and other  social change groups are calling this a crucial election.  "Women cannot afford another Tory  government and the Liberals are no better.  The single most important issue in this election has to be to stop the North American  Free Trade Agreement and to stop the 'kill  the deficit a t any cost' hysteria tha t the Tories  are generating," says Miche Hill of the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women. NAC is a coalition of more than 500  women's groups across the country.  Hill says raising awareness of these and  other dangers of the "neo-conservative"  agenda will be at the heart of women's organizing in the election.  In the Vancouver area, representatives  from a number of women's groups and  union women's committees have joined with  NAC BC representatives to establish a regional election committee. Much of the committee's work will tie into NAC's national  strategy, which is to make NAFTA, the fu  ture of Canada's social programs, women's  employment and poverty, a national child  care program, and violence against women,  key election issues.  Activities include compiling and distributing fact sheets, speaking engagements,  attending public and all candidates meetings and a series of guerilla theatre skits  featuring "Everywoman" that focus on various election issues. "Everywoman" made  her first appearance at recent Take Back the  Night marches across the country. Future  plans for Everywoman in Vancouver include a performance at Simon Fraser University in October.  "We want to remind people of what's  been happening during the last eight years  of Tory government and get them thinking  about what kind of country they want," says  Hill. "Our goal is to make sure women make  an informed decision about the candidates,  their parties and their records."  The women of color caucus of the NAC  regional election committee will attempt to  integrate an anti-racist agenda throughout  the organization around the elections.  "We are ensuring that the specific concerns of women of colour, First Nations,  immigrant and refugee women are on the  table for NAC's campaigns on child care,  violence against women, anti-NAFTA and  others," says Chris Rahim of the Vancouver  Status of Women and the NAC BC caucus.  The caucus is stressing the importance  of issues of unemployment, health care,  employment standards, immigration and  domestic workers'rightsamongothers, adds  Rahim, noting for example, the recent transfer of immigration applications and processing to the Public Security portfolio. Both she  and NAC's Hill say the transfer represents a  new defining of immigration as a "threat to  public order" rather than a benefit to Canadian society.  "We've also written letters to various  women of colour and First Nations women's  groups in BC to update them on our activities, and share strategies on organizing  around the election," says Rahim.  The NAC BC committee is also helping  with the distribution of post cards that ask  NDP leader Audrey McLaughlin, Conservative Leader Kim Campbell and Liberal leader  Jean Chretien to agree to a national, televised  debate on women's issues. The idea is to  have as many people as possible sign and  mail the cards (no postage required).  In Vancouver, the committee is pushing  for an all-candidates meeting on women's  issues between Vancouver Centre candidates  PC Prime Minister Kim Campbell (the incumbent), Betty Baxter of the NDP and the  Liberal Party's Hedy Fry. So far Campbell  has declined all invitations to attend all-  candidates meetings.  Besides their work with NAC, the group  Women to WomenGlobal Strategies is sponsoring additional strategy workshops focusing on women and the economy. The  first took place during the NAC regional  meeting in September and another, planned  for sometime in October, will deal with  women's unpaid work.  "That meeting will feature Carol Lees,  who refused to fill out her census form  because it does not recognize women's unpaid work," says Lynn Bueckert of Women  to Women. (See related stories, p. 13). She  says the workshops are designed to provide  information and questions for women to  put to the candidates during the election and  tor any politician in the future.  "Our goal is to defeat the neo-conservative agenda, come up with alternatives, and  get politicians to listen to what we want.  Education around women's economic priorities goes well beyond the election."  See WOMEN & THE ELECTION page 8  OCTOBER 1993 News  Transition houses, childcare moved to  Women's Equality Ministry:  BC Cabinet  shuffle  by Fatima Jaffer  Changes to the Ministry of Women's  Equality in last month's mid-term cabinet  shuffle in the BC government could lead to  better services for BC women, according to  transition house workers and childcare advocates.  The responsibility for child daycare programs and transition houses, safehomes and  second-stage housing has been shifted from  the Ministry of Social Services to the Women's Equality. The Ministry also has a new  deputy minister, Suzanne Veit. Former  Women's Equality deputy minister, Sheila  Wynn, is now Deputy Minister of Social  Services.  Other changes include the creation of a  new job-creation ministry called Employment and Training headed by former finance minister Glen Clark; the reassignment  of former health minister Elizabeth Cull to  the Ministry of Finance; and the removal of  Joan Smallwood from her Social Services  portfolio.  The new Minister of Social Services is  Joy McPhail, a former BC Federation of Labour official. McPhail will be responsible for  what premier Mike Harcourt recently called  a crackdown on "welfare cheats and dead-  beats," something Smallwood had been reluctant to do as Social Services minister.  "I think it's utterly appalling that  Harcourt has no understanding of poverty.  So now he's got Joy [McPhail] to do his dirty  work for him," says Pam Fleming of End  Legislated Poverty.  The Vancouver Status of Women's Miche  Hill calls Harcourt's comments "a page out  of the SocCred Party's book.  "It's pretty clear the NDP are prepared  to abandon any semblance of being a Social  Democratic party in order to gain support in  the poor-bashing climate we now have in  this country.  "It will be interesting to see how far  right he's prepared to go."  Transition houses  The changes are "a bit sudden so we're  stunned," says Greta Smith of the BC and  Yukon Association of Transition Houses  The radical feminist magazine  v£>  Issue 23 Spring 1992  *   Hail Mary Robinsonl  __.  •   Childcare: The forgotten  4-  demand  tf\  *   Anita Hill speaks out  *   Southall Black Sisters  E3  *   Fat Lesbian in art  —"A formidable feminist magazine -  not for the faint-hearted."

Smith says responsibility for  transition houses has been the Ministry of  Social Services' for as long as she can remember.  "I view [the ministry's  new responsibility for  transition houses] as an  opportunity to look at a  real policy review."  -Penny Priddy  "And up to this point, transition houses  have been contracted on a regional and area  basis...There's going to be a tremendous  amount of change and development."  Lee Lakeman of Rape Relief and Transition Houses says the changes "hopefully  mean that the provincial government is understanding transition houses as agents of  women's equality and that our job is not just  to hide women but to fight for women's  equality."  The fact that women's centres and transition houses are now both under Women's  Equality should mean that transition houses  will be treated "as feminist institutions. That  will open an avenue for us to get paid for our  work in public education, community organizing and advocacy," says Lakeman.  Penny Priddy, who stays on as minister  of the two-year-old Ministry of Women's  Equality, says the ministry's budget has not  increased, and the ministry has been told not  to expect a bigger budget next year. But, she  says, there will be no job losses or funding  cutbacks and services will not be disrupted  during the transition of services between  ministries.  "I view [the ministry's new responsibility for transition houses] as an opportunity  to look at a real policy review," says Priddy.  "When [the transition house sector] is  under Social Services, they're seen...as an  emergency housing/shelter issue, whereas  it is an issue of violence against women. I've  made a commitment that we will ask feminist organizations to sit down and talk about  the issues of [policies and] funding. But I  haven't thought about what that [consultation] would look like yet."  Lakeman cautions that an immediate  danger is that the changes will set up an  arbitrary division between women's centres  and transition houses on the one hand, and  rape crisis centres on the other. The Attorney  General's ministry will continue to administer funding and policy for sexual assault  centres like Women Against Violence Against  Women (WAVAW), and for members of the  Association of Specialised Victim Assault  Prevention Centres (SVAPs).  "Why are sexual assault centres not getting consistent money from the Ministry of  Women's Equality? It isn't logical," asks  Lakeman.  Workers at WAVAW had not heard of  the changes and were unable to comment.  The Association of SVAPs could not be  reached for a response. However, women's  organizations in the past have criticized the  placing of sexual assault centres under the  Attorney General's portfolio because it ties  issues of violence against women too closely  with their law-and-order agenda.  Says Lakeman: "Rape crisis centres also  need the protection of politicians who understand violence against women and the  connections between transition houses and  rape crisis centres."  Priddy could not say why rape crisis  centres were not transferred to her ministry  but, "with [certain women] now in the community justice branch of the Attorney General's ministry...there is more of a focus on  community justice and issues that affect  women's lives and I expect we will have a  closer working relationship around similar  issues...for sexual assault centres than we've  had in the past."  Childcare programs  "The powerful integration of both policy  and funding innitatives for childcare within  Women's Equality ministry will probably  make innovation of child care services more  effective," says Peter Ashmore of the West  Coast Daycare Association.  Ashmore says the changes, which bring  the major parts of the childcare funding  streams—Social Services' subsidies and Women's Equality's special needs—together will  allow child care workers to look at providing subsidies "in a different model."  "It's pretty consistent with the major  thrust of the BC Task Force on Childcare,"  says Ashmore. The 1991 BC report, Showing  We Care, offered a comprehensive look at  existing childcare and challenged the then-  Social Credit government to establish new  innitatives to create, develop, and fund a  better system. In April 1992, the NDP's new  innitatives in childcare saw the creation of  an Inter-Ministerial Child Care Coordinating Committee, involving nine ministries,  with a Child Care Development Branch at  the Ministry of Women's Equality in the  central role.  While Inter-Ministerial involvement and  coordination between ministries like Aboriginal affairs, licensing, training, and municipal affairs will continue, Ashmore says  that the extent to which the Ministry of  Social Services mandate was focused around  income assistance limited a broader view of  the role of childcare for all families to address issues of economic stability.  Being under Women's Equality is "the  difference that will make the difference,"  says Ashmore, "because it means broader  perspectives on childcare will be possible."  Women's Equality minister Priddy says  the transfer of childcare programs to Women's Equality will allow for a comprehensive  review of childcare dollars.  "Social Services doesn't exactly deliver  programs. They largely deal with subsidy  issues. Because we already have the responsibility to coordinate childcare policy in the  government, this is a logical move. But it  doesn't make any sense if people think all  we're going to do is go out there and pick it  up out of social services.  "This is not about anyone losing their  jobs, not about reduction in service at all, this  is not some kind of way to say can we cut  corners...this is a way to say, can we have a  policy review."  Priddy says policy under review will  include regular childcare policy, the young  parent program, special needs childcare, and  some bridging to employment programs.  Among questions on the Ministry's  agenda are "how do we make sure existing  childcare resources are getting to people  who need them, how do we make sure  they're happening in the most respectful  way, [and] is there a way of making it easier  for families..."Future options for delivery of  subsidy programs for single moms on welfare could include a mail-in system, for example.  Ashmore says he expects families currently involved in the subsidy program will  have to go through the transition. "But nothing has changed so far."  The transition of both childcare and  transition house services from Social Services to Women's Equality is expected to be  done by April next year, and is to be planned  in consultations with the ministries, childcare and transition house workers.  The BC&YATH has already met with  representatives from both ministries. Says  Smith: "It will be a gradual takeover. We'll  be part of the transition team. It's not like  everyone's contracts will suddenly end."  SEX SELECTION from page 3  "They just don't get what we're talking  about," says Bhagat. "They're looking at the  issue as if it's just about sex selection. We're  looking at it in its context of violence against  women, and the inequality of women."  South Asian women organizing against  sex selection have been very active getting  the information out about the issues, says  Dosanjh. "The fight against these practices is  on all fronts. We have been doing awareness-raising programs within the community, through articles, interviews on television and radio, leafletting, and open talk  shows."  The IMA has been organizing in the  Vancouver South Asian community for 20  years [see Kinesis, Mar/93.]  The four South Asian newspapers are  calling the boycott a form of censorship. But  the Coalition rejects that position. "We don't  have legal or social power, nor do we have  sufficient economic power to censor," says  Dosanjh.  "To 'censor' advertising of a technology  that perpetuates female foeticide is not  censorhip at all. It is the same as using  economic sanctions to pressure the newspapers to stop the ad."  A week following the press conference,  all three political parties received written  "assurances" from The Link and The Indo-  Canadian Times that they would not run  Stephens' ad. The Conservatives and Liberals say that is enough for them to lift the  boycott.  The Coalition has not been informed by  the newspapers about their decision to not  run the ad. The Coalition says the "assurances" are not enough because they are not  accompanied by a public statement that the  newspapers will stop running the ad permanently.  As Kinesis goes to press, the New Democratic Party has issued a statement that they  would continue the boycott until the newspapers clearly state in an editorial their intention to permanently withdraw these advertisements.  Atthe recent Take Back the Night march  in Vancouver, the Coalition gathered over  600 signatures in support of the boycott.  Coalition members say they will keep up  their boycott of the newspapers.  The Coalition is organizing a march and  rally, Saturday, October 2, at 2 pm, starting at  the parking lot of Langara Campus at Ontario  and 49th and proceeding through the Punjabi  market on Main St. For more information, call  VSW, 255-5511, or India Mahila Association,  321-7225.

OCTOBER 1993 News  Employment Standards Review:  Minimum wage attacked  by Sue Vohanka  Wages and welfare rates need to increase so people can live in dignity instead of  poverty, and minimum standards must apply to all workers, without the exceptions  that now exclude many working women  and other poor people.  That's part of the message End Legislated Poverty (a coalition of groups fighting  poverty) delivered to the provincial government-appointed committee now reviewing  BC's Employment Standards Act.  "Minimum rates are so low that we  have people across the country working full-  time and in deep poverty," says Patricia  Chauncey, a community organizer for ELP.  ELP wants the provincial government  to raise the minimum wage to $9.05 an hour.  "We want that done as soon as possible,"  Chauncey told Kinesis.  ELP is also concerned about work-for-  welfare programs, which are now being used  in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta. "We're talking about work camps when we're talking  work for welfare," she says. Employers, the  federal government, almost every provincial government, and large business associations are all supporting work-for-welfare  schemes, says Chauncey. Here in BC, the  Fraser Institute, the Reform Party and the  Conservative Party are all pushing work for  welfare.  "We're talking about a huge pool of  people forced to work without any labour  standards at all," Chauncey says. "Everybody loses when you have work for welfare.  It's a form of slavery," she adds.  "The close tie between welfare issues  and labour legislation is really obvious."  ELP wants government to concentrate  on job development instead of employment  training programs. "There isn't enough focus on creating permanent decent jobs," she  says. "Job training does nothing without job  development."  At the review committee's first public  hearing in Vancouver on August 30, anti-  poverty groups, labour and domestic workers were extremely concerned by thenumber  of business groups making presentations.  The business groups appearing at the  committee's hearings are calling for a more  competitive environment. "Competitive  means some people win and some people  lose very badly," says Chauncey. She points  out that the Coalition of BC Businesses, which  represents more than 50,000 small businesses,  is calling for a "flexible" minimum wage.  As Chauncey asks: "What's a flexible  minimum wage, when current minimum  wage laws are so inadequate that people are  going hungry working full-time, not able to  pay their rents working full-time? Flexibility  in this kind of situation means people will  suffer." In their presentation, ELP says it is  concerned about part-time workers, and all  the groups of workers who are now excluded from basic parts of BC's Employment Standards Act, and the young people  who work for a legislated lower minimum  wage.  "We have a lot of concern for people  who're doing piecework and homework,"  Chauncey says. "Children are working in  this country, and that's something we have  to consider," she adds. "We also know the  situation of domestic workers across this  province is disastrous, and very dangerous  for those women."  ELP is also concerned about employment standards for people working in the  sex trade, includingexotic dancers and models. "We want that to be considered a s  issue," Chauncey says.  L%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%X%%%%%X%%X  "Welfare rates, being as low as they are,  do force low-income women and women on  welfare into the sex trade," she adds. "Children in this province are working in the sex  trade."  According to Mary Rowles of the BC  Federation of Labour, the review committee's approach (conducting public hearings  in 13 BC cities) leaves a lot to be desired.  "The whole process is screwed," says  Rowles. "There's a flaw in the whole idea of  community consultation in this. If you're a  worker who's not a member of an organization, it's hopelessly intimidating."  It's hard for unorganized workers to  come forward and publicly criticize their  employers, she points out.  When an employer fires a worker for  speaking out, the only recourse for unorganized workers is usually the Employment  Standards Act-which fails to protect the  rights of precisely those workers who most  need a little help from the law.  Chauncey says the review committee is  getting lots of information from community  groups and organizations representing  workers about the changes that are needed.  "We're concerned this information be  used by the government, not shelved," she  says. "We want government to analyse very  carefully the information that's coming in."  by Sue Vohanka  According to Cenen Bagon of the DWCR,  the Employment Standards Act should es- *'  tablish a central registry for domestic workers, and a tripartite committee (representing  domestic workers, employers and government) to set and enforce standards within  the domestic service sector.  Bagon says these changes are needed so  domestic workers can effectively bargain for  better conditions. [For more on DWCR's  sectoral bargaining proposals, see Kinesis, Sep/  93.]  The DWA brief includes 26 stories of  individual domestic workers. The horrendous conditions in which these women live  "How can these  committee members,  who are all white  Canadians-represent or  understand the situation  of domestics and farm  workers?"  -Crisanta Sampang  What can you do about it?  The Vancouver Committee for Domestic Workers and Caregivers' Rights (DWCR) is  asking the women's community to come out and support organizations addressing the  employment standards review committee this month.  "We want people to be there to support the recommendations," says Cenen Bagon, a  representative of DWCR.  WCR and other organizations are also asking people to write down their own experiences and send them in to the review committee.  "We urge low-income people to send their ideas to the group," says Pat Chauncey, a  community organizer for End Legislated Poverty.  "What people need to do is counter the absolutebullshit we're hearing from employers,"  says Mary Rowles, director of legislation and research for the BC Federation of Labour.  She encourages individual workers to write letters about their own experiences and  send them to: Commissioner Mark Thompson, Employment Standards Review, Parliament  Buildings, Victoria, B.C. V8V 1X4. (October 7 is the deadline for written submissions.)  Organizations representing domestic  workers want provincial labour laws to stop  discriminating against one of the most exploited groups of working women.  The groups are making detailed recommendations for changes to BC employment  standards legislation, during a series of public hearings that began August 30 and is  ending October 7.  Domestic workers want the law to provide:  the same hourly minimum wage and  overtime pay for domestics as other BC workers;  the right to claim unpaid wages beyond the six-month limits in the law now,  and to receive interest on all monies wrongly  withheld by employers;  basic (and clearly written) information  about employment standards, in the language of the worker; and  a progressive system of penalties for  employers who break the law.  Many other changes are proposed in the  detailed briefs prepared by the West Coast  Domestic Workers Association (DWA), presented August 30, and the Vancouver Committee for Domestic Workers and Caregivers  Rights (DWCR), presented September 29.  and work are powerful reasons why the law  needs to change.  "These women have shared similar  problems, which included long working  days, no days off, no statutory holidays,  irregular or non-payment of salaries, inadequate room and board, sexual, verbal and  physical forms of harassment, threats of deportation and confiscation of passport," the  brief says.  Up to 5,000 domestic workers-most of  them women of colour from the Philippines  and the Caribbean-are currently living and  working in their employers' homes in BC.  After the provincial government appointed a seven-member panel in April to  review BC employment standards legislation, representatives of domestics and farm  workers expressed deep concern about the  committee's make-up.  "How can these committee members,  who are all white Canadians, and perhaps  have never experienced being in the lowest  rung of the labour ladder, represent or understand the situation of domestics and farm  workers?" asked Crisanta Sampang of the  West Coast Domestic Workers Association,  in a letter to labour minister Moe Sihota.  "It is normal for them to omit the people  who are powerless," says farm workers'  representative Charan Gill.  In late June, Sihota introduced legislation to make domestic workers and other  previously excluded workers (in banking,  financial services, medical and dental offices  and insurance) eligible for workers' compensation coverage if they are injured on the  job.  "This is a significant change in public  policy—one we're quite proud of," Sihota  told reporters at the time.  According to domestic workers and  advocates for their rights, this is one long-  awaited step in the right direction. And, they  say, they are determined to ensure it is only  one step of many to come in the months  ahead.  OCTOBER 1993 Movement Matters  listings information  Movement Matters is designed to be  a network of news, updates and information of special interest to the women's movement.  Submissions to Movement Matters  should be no more than 500 words,  typed, double spaced and may be  edited for length. Deadline is the 18th  of the month preceding publication.  by Manisha Singh  Catalogue of Black  women in film  The women's program at the National  Film Board has produced a new catalogue:  Studio D's Black on Screen: Images of Black  Canadians 1950's-1990's,a directory of works  by Black and non-Black filmmakers, their  distributors and rental/sales information.  The stated purpose of the catalogue is to  provide a framework and historical context  in which to view the growing body of work  by Black Canadians. The idea for the project  resulted from marketing strategies for a Studio Drelease, Sisters in the Struggle, by Dionne  Brand and Ginny Stikeman in 1991.  The decision to include works by non-  Black filmmakers was taken in an attempt to  build a historical context for Black practitioners, as a record of how people within  Black communities were seen by others, especially non-Black filmmakers, and about  how Black communities were constructed  on film during certain periods of time.  Works by women mentioned in the catalogue include: Black Mother Black Daughter,  directed by Sylvia Hamilton and Claire  Prieto, a tribute to Black women who struggled for over 200 years to create and maintain home and community in Nova Scotia;  From Nevis To..., directed by Christene  Browne, a docu-drama that looks at a West  Indian woman's arrival in Canada; Older  Stronger Wiser, by Claire Prieto and Dionne  Brand, in which five Black women talk about  their lives in rural and urban Canada between 1920 and 1950; Sisters In the Struggle,  by Dionne Brand and Ginny Stikeman, featuring the insights and testimonies of Black  women who are active in community, feminist and labour organizations; There's No  Place Like Home, by Janine Fuller, "a wry  feminist postcript to the International Year  of Shelter for the Homeless, where single  mothers, Aboriginal women, Black women,  and low-income women describe their experiences with the housing crisis and tell  storiesof racism, abuse andslum landlords."  The catalogue also includes a description of works in progress.

BEGINNERS GROUP  September 16  ESS 734-9816  KINESIS  OCTOBER 1993 What's News  by Lissa Geller  Welfare program  improved  Pressure from BC anti-poverty advocates has forced the provincial government  to improve their volunteer program.  The government has lowered the hours  required for women on social assistance to  be eligible for benefits from 40 to 10 volunteer hours per month. Previously, people on  social assistance could recieve $100 a month  for volunteering in non-profit organizations  to gain job experience but they had to work  at least 40 hours per month. This made it  difficult for many, particularly single mothers or women with small children.  As well, there is no time limit on the  number of months you can work so women  can volunteer for as many months as they  are able to.  The community volunteer program was  first set up under the NDP government and  is geared mainly towards people not ready  for full-time employment or training, and  for single parents.  Initially, the Ministry of Social Services,  which oversees the program, required nonprofit groups to have a criminal record check  of staff and volunteers before they could  accept volunteers on the program. Non-profit  organizations refused and the Ministry had  to cancel the requirement.  Anyone interested in registering for the  program should contact their MSS worker,  or for more information, contact End Legislated Poverty at 879-1209.

VOS 1E0  Housing grants  anti-lesbian  The BC provincial government's guidelines on homeowner's grants currently being mailed to property owners in BC explicitly violate the province's ownhuman rights  code which prohibits discrimination on the  grounds of sexual orientation.  The guidelines define spouse as being a  member of the opposite sex and do not allow  for any conjugal relationship between two  women or two men. This means that if a  woman owns a house and dies, her lesbian  partner, regardless of the length of their  relationship, would not be entitled to apply  for a homeowner's grant because they did  not have a recognized "conjugal" relationship.  Despite pressure from various communities and the fact that the guidelines are in  violation of both provincial and federal acts,  the tax office has not yet updated nor  amended the guidelines.  Chilly climate  chillier  The Chilly Climate Committee of the  University of Victoria's Political Science department is facing continued harassment  and retaliation from the UVic administration and the eight male, tenured staff who  opposed dialogue on sexism in the PoliSci  department.  And despite the objections of Chilly  Climate Committee members, UVic staff and  students from across the country, the Administration has decided to appoint an "external, independent" commission to investigate complaints of sexism and sexual harassment.  The Chilly Climate Committee made its  preliminary report in March. It found that  there is a lack of female professors, feminist  analysis in the classroom, high levels of  harassment and intimidation faced by female students in the department, and an  overall "chilly climate" experienced by female students in Political Science.  Since March, the committee members,  including Somer Brodribb, the only tenured  woman professor in the department, have  faced continued threats and intimidation by  the male tenured professors. This retaliation  has been felt by students in classrooms and  by Brodribb when her tenure request was  under consideration by the Administration.  In response to the harassment, the members of the Committee launched a class action suit against the male professors with the  BC Ombudsman and the Human Rights  Council. As well, the members asked UVic  president, David Strong, and the UVic Ad  ministration to publicly distance themselves  from the defamatory actions and remarks of  the male professors.  In a press release dated August 27, the  members point out that "such a gesture on  Strong's part would convince us of the administration's genuine commitment to addressing systemic discrimination and ending the retaliation we now endure for raising  issues of equity."  There was no response. However, since  then, UVic has appointed an external review  commission to investigate the working and  learning environment for women and men  in the department. The terms of reference of  this commission will be developed in conjunction with the male professors.  While Committee members are also  being asked for input on the terms of reference, they have chosen not to comply given  the lack of neutrality on the part of the UVic  president and the administration.  Says Dorothy Smith, spokesperson for  the members: "Until the retaliation against  us for reporting systemic discrimination is  recognized and remedied, there can be no  meaningful and sincere inquiry into improving the environment for women students  and staff."  Chinese-Canadians  demand redress  Approximately 4,000 members of the  BC Coalition of Head Tax Payers, Spouses  and Descendants are using this federal election to highlight the racist policies of past  Canadian governments with respect to Chinese people.  The Coalition is requesting that the federal government pay about $23 million in  redress for the racist head tax policy which  was in effect from 1885 to 1923 in Canada [see  story, page 14.]  The racist policy imposed a $500 head  tax, the equivalent of three years wages, on  all Chinese people seeking to immigrate to  Canada. Many people who emigrated were  forced to borrow the money and work it off  as indentured servants for as long as five  years in order to stay in Canada.  The head tax was repealed in 1923 but  was replaced by the Chinese Immigration  (Exclusion) Act, which barred entry into  Canada for Chinese people, until it was  repealed in 1947.  Victor Wong, a spokesperson for the  group, says that the $23 million would be  used to pay back those who were forced to  pay the Head Tax and their descendants.  The remainder of the money would be used  to establish a community trust fund to help  seniors and promote racial harmony in  Canada.

Prime Minister Kim Campbell's response has been even more insulting, according to Wong. She sent a form letter to  Wong, thanking him for his "encouraging  words" and asking him to support the Tories' re-election bid.  Wong is calling Campbell's response  "small comfort" for the people forced to  endure the racist policies of the government,  and urges the Tories to make good on the  promise contained in the letter of "building  an even brighter future for all Canadians" by  redressing the wrong.  Women's Health  Bureau established  The federal department of Health and  Welfare has recently established a Women's  Bureau to focus directly on health issues as  they affect women.  Coming so soon after the silicon breast  implant scandal, and recent mainstream  media stories about inadequate funding for  breast cancer and AIDS research for women,  the establishment of the Bureau is being seen  as an attempt to shore up the Tories' fading  re-election bid with women voters.  The new Women's Health Bureau was  crea ted in August and will be responsible for  the activities of the department as they relate  to women. It will focus on health issues of  particular concern to women and examine  the differential impacts of health programs  and policies on women.  The bureau also intends to provide public education and advocacy work, and will  liaise with women's groups and other organizations concerned aboutwomen's health.  It is unclear if the bureau intends to make  money available to existing groups or simply spend its budget internally.  Sexist judge  keeps job  Women's groups are outraged following the findings of a five-man four-woman  judicial council in Manitoba that sexist attitudes and behaviour do not constitute incompetence in a judge.  A Manitoba judge who admitted to  making sexist comments in his courtroom  but claimed it was all part of his "gruff  exterior" has received a reprimand from the  Judicial Council of Manitoba and will be  allowed to continue on the bench.  The mild rebuke was given after the  judge tried unsuccessfully to stop the inquiry by taking the Council to court.  The Council stopped short of suspending Judge Frank Allen, saying that, while his  comments were inappropriate, they did not  constitute incompetence.  The complaints against the judge were  filed after he told a man on trial for threatening to kill his girlfriend and himself that  "there isn't any woman worth the trouble  you got yourself into." He also told a woman  lawyer who wanted a recess to tend to her  sick baby that the defendant should find a  lawyer who "isn't trying to be a mother and  a lawyer at the same time."  The judge's lawyer argued that the  judge's comments had been taken out of  context. Council rejected that argument but  ruled against dismissing the judge because  judges "shouldn't have to fear that their  opinions might cost them their jobs."

Postering on telephone poles and other  public property has been illegal in many  communities, including Vancouver, forsome  time. Now a similar law has been struck  down in the Supreme Court and, some say,  it may pave the way for greater freedom of  expression among groups who cannot afford higher priced advertising.  The Supreme Court ruled that a civic  law in Peterborough, Ontario, outlawing  postering in public places infringes on Canadians' rights to freedom of expression. In a  unanimous decision, the court said that  "while the legislative goals are important,  they do not warrant the complete denial of  access to a historically and politically significant form of expression."  But the decision stopped short of any  sweeping comments about freedom of  speech. One Justice noted that it would be  difficult to support total bans on postering  and demonstrating in public places.  As a result, lawyers for the Attorney  General in Ontario are predicting that the  judgement will be interpreted narrowly and  will not have the far reaching affects had the  Supreme Court declared all anti-postering  laws an infringement.  It is also unclear how the ruling will  affect regulations that have been put in place  that restrict the size and colour of posters,  the timing of protests or the number of  demonstrators. The ruling said that civic  bylaws could restrict all of these variables  and even impose a fee for users of the poles.  WOMEN &THE ELECTION from page 3  Cenen Bagon of the Vancouver Domestic Workers and Caregivers Association says  her group's pre-election activities include  circulation of a petition (initiated by the  Toronto Organization for Domestic Workers Rights) to all party leaders outlining  changes the Association wants to see to immigration policies for domestic workers.  At End Legislated Poverty, activities  will include making sure low-income people are registered to vote, attending as many  all candidates meetings as possible to put an  anti-poverty agenda on the table, and compiling a one-page fact sheet on NAFTA and  other employment and poverty issues of  importance to low-income people. "We'll  distribute as many as possible to people in  the Downtown Eastside [section of Vancouver] especially," says ELP organizer Linda  Marcott, adding that the sheets will include  suggested questions for anyone attending  an all candidates meeting.  On the childcare front, Campaign Childcare '93 is calling for a national childcare  program. Campaign Childcare is a component of and has been endorsed by First Call,  a national child advocacy organization committed to the implementation of the United  Nations Convention on the Rights of the  Child. Organizations involved in Campaign  '93 are the Childcare Advocacy Association  of Canada, NAC, the Canadian Labour Congress, the National Organization of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women, the Child  Poverty Action Group, the Native Women's  Association of Canada and the Assembly of  First Nations.  Clayoquot bands  seek injunction  First Nations people in the Clayoquot  area of Vancouver Island have stepped up  their fight to stop logging in Clayoquot  Sound.  The Clayoquot band have been joined  by the Ahousat and Hesquiat bands in asking the BC Supreme Court for an injunction  that would stop logging, similar to an injunction used to stop logging on Meares  Island, in the centre of Clayoquot Sound.  Band chiefs have held meetings to discuss which areas of the Sound to pinpoint in  their court applications which, if allowed,  would stop the logging until outstanding  land claims are settled with federal and provincial governments.  The bands, all of whom have outstanding land claims in the area, have been fighting for land recognition with the federal  government since 1982 and are not expect-  inga quick solution to the outstanding claims.  Until recently, the province refused to  even admit the First Nations people had  legitimate claims but the bands have taken  their fight to the newly formed BC Treaty  Commission. The Commission, formed last  year, has not yet established dates to begin  talks.  The Friends of Clayoquot Sound say  they have been encouraged by this development, particularly since their blockade  is facing increasing harassment from  MacMillan Bloedel and International Forest  Products who have licenses to log the area.  The Friends' spokesperson Valerie  Langer has said the group will offer to help  raise money with the bands to pay legal  expenses in their bid to stop the destruction  of Clayoquot Sound.  Says long time Vancouver childcare activist Penny Coates, also working with Campaign '93: "We're basically putting forward  the same goals and demands as we've always had. High quality, affordable, accessible child care that is culturally responsible,  addresses special needs, meets women's different working arrangements and has a variety of licensed programs."  Campaign '93 is proposing a three-year  plan, beginning with an immediate lifting of  the ceiling on the Canada Assistance Plan to  give provinces access to more funding, the  reinstatement of the $60 million promised  for Aboriginal childcare, establishment of a  federal capital program for childcare, extension of initial program funding to include  research and innovative pilot programs, and  a detailed strategy from each of the parties  showing how they will move into a comprehensive child care system.  "We're planning strategy meetings  around all-candidates meetings and we're  encouraging people to phone candidates in  their riding and ask for a copy of their party's childcare policy," says Coates.  "We expect this to create quite a bit of  momentum because the Progressive Conservatives don't have a childcare policy paper. It will really put the pressure on. A few  thousand calls like that from around the  province would be great."  Women interested in working with the  NAC Election Committee should call Miche  at255-5511 for information on thenext meeting. Meetings are open to all women. Volunteers are needed.

Feds delay  Little Sister's case  As Kinesis goes topress, we have just heard  that the court granted the Attorney General's  Ministry one more adjournment. The case is  indefinitely delayed.  Little Sister's Bookstore has lambasted  the federal government for attempting to  drain the resources of the bookstore by dragging out a case involving Canada Customs  seizure of lesbian an-" gay periodicals and  books as they cross the border.  The federal Attorney General's office  requested an adjournment on a trial set to  begin early October on the grounds that they  need more time to prepare their case.  But spokesperson Janine Fuller pointed  out that the case has dragged on for over  three years and has been subjected to two  previous postponements. She notes that, "if  the government thinks that they can manipulate our resolve to continue this case by  delaying it yet again, they are mistaken."  The landmark case, which has the support of the BC Civil Liberties Association,  PEN International, the worldwide organization of writers, and other groups, involves  the seizure of books and periodicals with  lesbian and gay themes which Canada Customs seized without appeal or compensation in 1990.  Little Sisters and the BC Civil Liberties  Association is asking the court to take away  Canada Customs' arbitrary power to detain  books and magazines at the border irrespective of whether the material can be legally  declared obscene.  Fuller concludes that foot dragging will  not stop the bookstore's determination to  fight the case. "We've had tremendous support from communities across North  America in putting this case together. There's  a lot of anger out there at the government's  inability to resolve this case in a court of law.  This inability is facilitating the government's  continued power to tell us which books we  can read...We have a right to see this situation resolved."  MPs just  say no  British elect  Neo-Nazi  The election of a member of the ultra  right-wing racist British National Party to  British parliament should come as no surprise to "shocked" Members of Parliament,  say Anti-Nazi League activists.  Theanti-racistorganization says the tacit  "soft" racism of two of Britain's major political parties, the Liberal Democrats and the  Labour Party, is equal evidence of the rise in  legally sanctioned racist activity against people of colour in Great Britain.  "The door [to the election of neo-Nazi  Derek Beackon] was opened up by the local  politicians for the two main parties," by  praying on racist fears in the East London  riding known as Millwall, and playing a  "soft racist card" to municipal voters, says  Anti-Nazi LeaguespokespersonRahulPatel.  Beackon, who ran on a platform of  "rights for whites" and campaigned against  what he claimed was "preferential treatment" of people of colour, squeaked in by  seven votes to defeat the Labour Party candidate in the local government by-elections of  an East London community.  In response to Anti-Nazi League demands, Liberal Democratic Party leader  Paddy Ashdown has announced an inquiry  into his party's activities during the  byelection and has vowed to crack down on  racism in the party.  The East London area has been the site  of 53 reported attacks on people of colour by  white gangs this year.  Certain Liberal and Progressive Conservative members of parliament will stifle  deba te on the Tories' controversia 1 drug pa t-  ent law during the upcoming elections, according to a confidential document leaked  to the New Democratic Party last month.  The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada (PMAC) document outlines an election strategy to stifle debate on  the law that allows drug companies to patent drugs for up to 20 years, preventing the  manufacture of cheaper generic drugs, driving up the price of drugs and making them  a scarce commodity.  The memo was leaked to the NDP Member of Parliament for Surrey North Jim  Karpoff. Karpoff says PMAC identifies several Liberal and Conservative MPs who can  be counted on as allies.  NDP Leader Audrey MacLaughlin  blasted the Liberals and Tories and declared  that a "conspiracy of silence" existed to keep  Bill C-91 from becoming an election issue.  She said PMAC and other "multinational  drug companies and their political friends in  Ottawa don't want you to know there are  choices."  Federal figures show that the Liberals  received $47,000 from drug companies in  1992, while the Conservatives received  $67,000.  The implications on the elections process are staggering according to Karpoff.  "It shows the international drug companies are interfering in a democratic election to stifle discussion."  Racist cops  target youth  There has been a protest in Florida by  anti-racism groups and mothers of the Black  youth who were dragged in for questioning  following the killing of a British tourist in  Tallahassee in August.  Police in Monticello, a town just north  of Tallahassee, rounded up Black teenagers  with criminal records, and questioned and  held them for extended periods following  the death of the tourist from West Yorkshire,  England.  Police claimed they were simply responding to a description of the youth involved in the murder.  The anti-racist Rainbow Coalition have  accused the police of overt racism in their  investigations. Says Rainbow Coalition  spokesperson Reece Joyner: "Tney have to  follow through on leads but not go door-to-  door harassing everyone" he said.  "Just because there may be a young  person in your household,, does that makes  you automatically suspect?"  OCTOBER 1993 Feature  Vienna Conference on Human Rights:  Downstairs at the UN  by Shelagh Day  Women's Rights Are Human Rights  Women took an important step forward  in Vienna in June at the Second World Conference on Human Rights. Since 1948 when  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  was first proclaimed and other international  human rights instruments began to be developed, human rights have been defined by  men and for men. They have been understood to address those violations of civil and  political rights which male-designed and  male-led governments commit when they  are challenged by other men. The murder,  torture, and coercion of women have, on the  other hand, been understood to be private  matters—aspects of family life, religion, or  culture—and therefore not human rights  issues.  In Vienna, women smashed through a  wall of silence to bring our issues into the  center of the international human rights  agenda. This was accomplished in a number  of ways.  In preparation for the Conference,  women in 124 countries organized a global  petition with more than one half million  names that was presented to the World Conference in Vienna. The petition called for the  inclusion of women in all aspects of the  proceedings and deliberations of the Conference, and specifically demanded recognition of violence against women as a human  rights violation.  Then, during those first two days in  Vienna, women from non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) from around the  world met in a working group and, building  on recommendations from regional meetings held in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,  drew together 18 recommendations to  present to the attending governments.  These recommeda tions drew on the  wide variety of women's experiences but  focused on specific, practical demands which  could transform the UN human rights system and widen the understanding of human  rights violations.  The Global Tribunal  Women also organized a Global Tribunal which brought 33 women from 24 countries to testify about political persecution,  viola tionsofwomen'ssocio-economic rights,  human rights abuses in the family, and war  crimes against women.  This testimony was anguishing to listen  to. For example, Bok Dong Kim of Korea, a  soft-spoken woman of great dignity, now in  her seventies, described being taken when  she was in her teens by Japanese soldiers and  forced to become a "comfort woman" for the  duration of World War II.  She was raped initially by doctors who  said that they had to examine her for any  disease. She was forced then to move with  the soldiers from front to front and to provide sexual services. On Saturday nights,  she said there were lines of men all day and  all night. They came into the small room  which she shared with other "comfort  women," raped, and left. The women were  exhausted, terrorized and left to deal with  the damage of being abused.  Bok Dong Kim was subsequently unable to have children, and at the Tribunal, so  many years later, she wept because of this  loss.  Khalida Messaoudi came from Algeria  to tell the story of Oum Ali. Oum Ali, who  was too afraid to come herself, lives in a  small town where religious fundamentalism dominated social and political life. In  1989 Oum Ali divorced. This made her a  pariah. The law in Algeria does not protect  divorced women or their children. In her  neighborhood, the men declared that she  was evil; they accused her of immorality and  prostitution, though she was only guilty of  the "crime" of having no husband.  At three o'clock one morning, Oum  Ali's house was stoned. She tried to get help  from her neighbors and from the village  police, but no one would protect her. Her  older children fled from the house, but while  she was trying to get help, the village men  broke in, set the beds on fire and burned her  three-year-old child to death.  These are only two of the 33 stories that  we heard. A doctor from the Sudan testified  about the history and practice of genital  mutilation and the lasting physical and psychological damage it does. Two women from  Puerto Rico described being persecuted by  police because of being "communist feminists." A woman from Kenya described wife-  battering, rape, and genital mutilation, and  an increase in incest with very young children because of the AIDS epidemic. Children, she said, are considered "AIDS-free  zones."  A woman from Latin America described  the vulnerability of women who are immigrants, migrant workers, or living without  documentation. Because these women have  no economic or social security, they are targets of every form of sexual coercion and  abuse—from rape to beingused as the sexual  initiators for the sons of their employers.  Repeatedly, the women who testified  made a connection between violations of  civil and political rights. Women who are  economically threatened, they said, who  cannot feed and house themselves and their  children, are more vulnerable to sexual abuse,  coercion, terrorism, torture, and death.  Upstairs, Downstairs at the Vienna  Conference  Though the impact of it was felt upstairs, it is important to point out that this  Global Tribunal went on downstairs at the  Vienna Conference, where the NGOs were  meeting, and was attended principally by  women.  In fact, the organization of the Conference as a whole could not have been more  symbolic. The Austria Centre in Vienna has  two levels. The top level was where the  official UN conference took place. The basement was the people's level.  Downstairs at the NGO Forum, the room  was full of impassioned talk, the walls were  plastered with notices of meetings, and the  hallways were filled with photographs of  women, children and men from all parts of  the world, maimed, tortured, and massacred.  Bosnian women told of being raped for  hours by Serbian soldiers, and Bosnian  women and men pleaded for support and  help. Asian women discussed the horrors of  widespread trafficking in women and sex  tourism. African women and men described  the devastating impact of the policies of the  International Monetary Fund and the World  Bank on the availability of food and health  care in their countries. Lesbians and gay  men described death squad assassinations  in Brazil and Mexico as a result of policies of  "social cleansing." Death by stoning in Iran  and coerced electro-shock treatment in Russia, China, and Taiwan.  Indigenous peoples documented  exterminations, plundering, degradation,  and environmental destruction. On the NGO  floor, there was much pain, and an urgent  demand for change.  Too little of this penetrated to the official level. Upstairs, the official delegates were  well-dressed, well-fed and protected by  heavily armed police with dogs. Upstairs  the pictures were pretty, the atmosphere  serene, the halls quiet. Human rights were  sanitized. There seemed to be only diplomatic arguments about terminology.  In this building, there were two different worlds. The upstairs world creates the  downstairs world and maintains the gulf  through indifference, at best, and, at worst,  through concerted effort.  Given this gulf, and the official decision  to shut the NGOs out of the drafting committee, where the crucial work of formulating the Conference Declaration was going  on, the task for women was to have as much  impact on the upstairs as possible through  pre-arranged events like the Tribunal and  through hallway lobbying.  The Global Tribunal, even though it  went on downstairs, did affect the atmosphere upstairs. It captured the interest of the  media because it was direct, real and horrifying evidence of what is happening to  womenaround theworld. Though they were  upstairs in their own cocoon, governments  learned about the women's evidence through  the news. And the women who lobbied  carried the stories upstairs with women's  demands.  Women's demands  At the Conference there were two important themes: the universality of human  rights and the indivisibility of those rights.  These concepts have been a part of the discussion onhuman rights since the time when  international rights documents began to be  developed. Currently, however, some governments assert that human rights must be  interpreted differently in different societies  to reflect their particular religions, traditions, and culture. In Vienna, women's responses to this assertion was a unified and  resounding "No." Women from many different cultures and groups argued in reply  that religion, tradition, and culture are used  to justify the subordination of women, to rob  women of human rights protection. The right  not to be tortured, killed, mutilated, or sexually coerced cannot be dependent on culture  or religion; it must be universal.  Also, some governments, including  Canada's, do not embrace with conviction  the indivisibility of civil and political rights  and economic, social and cultural rights.  They are inclined to emphasize civil and  political rights (the rights to vote, to a fair  trial, to security of the person) and downplay  or neglect the economic and social rights to  food, shelter, housing, jobs, and health care.  Again in Vienna, women were very  clear on this issue. The connection between  violations of economic and social rights and  violations of civil and political rights is tangible in women's lives. Women who do not  have enough to eat, do not vote; and women  who are economically at risk are vulnerable  to every form of social and physical coercion.  In particular, women demanded:  •the establishment of an International  Criminal Court to enforce international prohibition against human rights violations;  •the appointment of a Special  Rapporteur (a UN special investigator) on  violence against women;  •the inclusion of violations of women's human rights in the mandate and work  of all UN agencies, committees;  •the ratification of the Convention on  the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women by states, and the withdrawal or reservations which are obstacles  to effective implimentation;  •the adoption of an optional protocol  under the Women's Convention establishing an individual and group complaints procedure;  •the adoption of stronger measures  against sexual exploitation and trafficking  in women as a violation of human rights;  •the adoption of international and national measures to recognize persecution  based on sex as a basis for refugee status, and  better measures to protect women political  prisoners, refugee women, exiled women,  internally-displaced and migrant women;  • the adoption by states of goals and  timetables to secure equal representation for  women at all levels of decision-making; and  • the adoption by the UN of procedures  to expand the access of NGOs with expertise  in the field of women's human rights to all  UN structures and activities.  The official responses and the  future  Not surprisingly, the official Declaration from the Second World Conference on  Human Rights did not incorporate all of  these demands. However, the Declaration  includes a special section on women and a  number of helpful recommendations. It:  •recognizes that violence against  women, in bo th the public and priva te sphere,  is a human rights abuse;  •calls on the Human Rights Commission to appoint a Special Rapporteur on  Violence Against Women and endorses the  call for a complaint mechanism under the  Women's Convention;  •urges universal ratification of the  Women's Convention by the year 2000 and  the removal of existing reservations;  •calls for states to eradicate any conflicts which may arise between the rights of  women and the "harmful effects of certain  traditional or customary practices, cultural  prejudices and religious extremism";  •urges all UN agencies to specifically  address violations of women's human rights.  It is clear that this was a breakthrough  event for women on the international scene.  But there is so much more to be done. It is of  primary importance to build links among  women around the world so that we can  fight together against all forms of human  rights abuses.  On to Beijing and the Fourth World  Conference on Women in September 1985!  Shelagh Day attended the UN Conference  on Human Rights in Vienna.  OCTOBER 1993 Feature  _ Women's work and the census:  But who's counting?  by Barbara Little          The "masters of mankind" in economist  Adam Smith's day were the merchants and  manufacturers. The masters of humankind  in 1993 are the transnational corporations  and their institutions. Historically, and today, the goals are the same-to supply the  needs of the "masters." Nowhere, in the past  or present economic constructs, are the needs  and productive contributions of womankind a part of the equation. Men work.  Women do things. The things that women  do have never been valued or recognized as  work that should be counted and included  in productivity.  This historic lack of recognition of the  unwaged work of women was most forcibly  brought to our attention during Canada's  last census in June 1991. Our census does not  count this work. It specifically discounts it.  Far from being able to include her many  hours of unwaged work in her home and  community, a homemaker and/or volunteer was required to tick off a box "never  worked in lifetime" or face prosecution by  not complying with the law to complete the  census.  According to the thinking of Statistics  Canada bureaucrats and their international  counterparts, work, value, and productivity  are defined by their relationship to the marketplace. In other words, "work" is given a  "value" and considered "productive" only  when it is done in the marketplace and in  exchange for money. This is the man-made  construct accepted by governments and their  bureaucracies. It is no longer applicable to  today-certainly no longer acceptable to today's women and men. The unwaged work  of women is a gender issue and a power  issue. It is fundamental.  For two years now women have been  working seperately and collectively, in any  way we can, for change in the Canadian  census. We require the inclusion of unwaged  work for women and volunteers in the section "Work." To this end, we have been in  contact personally and through correspondence with representatives of StatsCan, and  have attended provincial, national and international conferences addressing the issue. We haveorganized and spoken at workshops and seminars and been interviewed  on the radio and TV.  We aim to raise womens' awareness of  the value of their unpaid work, to open eyes  and to change definitions. In the process, our  own eyes have been opened even wider and  our anger has become a stimulus to carry on.  Of course, what we are doing, all of the  above, economically speaking, is not work,  for we are not paid. I might point out here  though, that the bureaucrats who attend  these conferences are working-they are paid.  Many people at StatsCan have been very  helpful. Most of them acknowledge that the  things women do in their own homes, such  as meal preparation, caring for children,  laundering, cleaning house, nursing family  members, teaching cultural and moral values, driving children to music lessons, listening to teenagers' laments, et cetera, et  cetera, et cetera, is important work. But they  are at a loss as to how to count this unwaged  work and what to compare it with in the  market sector in order to assign it a value.  This is the crux-the economic system  which rules our lives requires all activities to  be related to the exchange of money, even  though the system is out of date and the  people at StatsCan are trying to work with  blinkers on.  Isn't it ironic that if a woman does any  of the aforementioned jobs outside her home  for someone else and for money (minimal),  then economically speaking, she works, she  is productive, she is (marginally, at least)  valuable, and her work will be counted in  the census?

The questions included in the  census must be approved by government  cabinet. The census is used in dealing with  other countries internationally as the document of reference respecting the status of  Canada.  The ramifications of the inclusion of  women's unwaged work in the census are  wide and far reaching. They affect a 11 of us in  one way or another. When women's condition are factored in, the status of Canada  changes dramatically. As Canada's Chief  Statistician wrote in a letter to one woman  who did refuse to complete the 1991 census  "The data from the 1991 Census of  Canada are important to the proper delivery  of many legislated programs including Federal and Provincial transfer payments which  are based on Census counts. Data from the  census are also used to plan and deliver  many regional and local programs including health care, services for the elderly,  schools, police, fire and other important community based services..."  How can we have "proper delivery" of  programs and services when the work of 44  percent of Canadian women who do not  work outside the home is not counted in the  census? Unfortunately, Mr. Fellegi seems  unable to understand that, by not including  the unwaged domestic work of women  (which by his own department's estimate is  around 37percent of the total working hours  of all Canadians) the "planning and delivery" of programs and services and so on are  based on incorrect data and many Canadian  women who are home managers do not  receive benefits in any way proportional to  their needs or their contribution in producing Canada's wealth.  Women's unwaged work  in the home and  community has been  kept invisible by not  counting it in the  census...  Because home managers' numbers are  not counted and their labour not valued,  they lack benefits such as financial compensation, pensions, workers' compensation,  regulated working conditions and fair treatment.  Women's unwaged work in the home  and community has been kept invisible by  not counting it in the census and not valuing  it in the national accounts (Gross Domestic  Product.) For too long this work has been  deemed by the masters of hu-mankind as  being "natural" to women. This is a myth  perpetuated to serve the "masters" needs.  The things women do are skills learned and  acquired. We must make this work visible  and therefore valued. Women know that  what we do is work and vital to our society  and that it must be counted as such.  To be apart of the impetus for change, please  join us.

In fact, there has been as little, maybe  even less discussion of women's issues in  this election campaign as in" others. This  campaign is business as usual with the boys  (and the few girls) in the back rooms and in  theeditorial rooms setting the agenda based  on partisan politics and right wing ideology. The major difference in this campaign  is not the gender of the leaders but the  emergence of the Bloc Quebecois and the  Reform Party as major forces, and the collapse of the NDP vote.  Nevertheless, Campbell is appealing  to many women voters, especially, it would  seem from the polls, young women. Unlike  Margaret Thatcher, she presents herself as a  woman and talks in positive terms about  being the first female Prime Minister and a  role model for young women. Her bafflegab  about the politics of inclusion and "the new  politics" have been exposed rather quickly  as empty rhetoric. Yet, perhaps many young  women are thinking of voting for Campbell  because they believe that all the parties are the same so they might as well vote for a  woman to be Prime Minister.  After the Mulroney era and the terrible betrayals by Ontario's NDP government,  it is difficult to dispute the argument that whatever they promise, governments,  whatever their political stripe, will carry out the sameneo-conservative agenda. And  while even I get a little thrill when I see the pronoun "she" in reference to the Prime  Minister, we should be clear that the election of Kim Campbell as Prime Minister (a  possibility that is looking pretty remote at the moment) will be catastrophic for  women's equality in this country.  Kim Campbell maybe a feminist in some vague sentimental way. Ihave no doubt  that she believes that women are equal to men and should be equally in positions of  power. But her feminism sees women's equality in the context of massive social  inequality. Inevitably that means a few white upper middle class women in positions  of power with the majority of women sinking further and further into poverty and  desperation. Her ideology is true blue conservative, much more conservative, I  would argue, than Brian Mulroney's. If we had any doubts about that, her single-  minded obsession with the deficit during the election campaign should put them to  rest.  OCTOBER 1993  Campbell's record  Her history as a Minister in the Mulroney  government gave us a preview of what to  expect and her performance on the hustings  rounds out the story. As Minister of Justice,  Campbell, despite being personally pro-choice,  tried mightily to recriminalize abortion, supported the cancellation of the Court Challenges Programme, and did little to achieve  her promises of a more inclusive justice system. And yet, she included women's groups  in a breakthrough consultation on the Rape  Law and defended the law in feminist terms.  The interesting thing about Campbell is  that she can talk the talk, but when it comes to  the walk, she is running as fas t as she can to the  extreme right of the economic/political spectrum. Campbell is certainly no fascist right  winger. On social issues, she talks as if she is  a liberal feminist, but her heart is in right-wing  economic policy that inevitably leads to the  same social policies proposed by the fascist  right—massive cuts to welfare, unemployment insurance, medicare, education, pension, and cutbacks in immigration. The social  inequality produced by such policies inevitably leads to an increase in racism and backlash  against feminism. This explains why she is so  reluctant to detail her plans for changes to  social programs. While on one or two issues  like judicial reform that do not run against this right wing agenda, she may take a  feminist line, on the vast majority of issues of concern to women, Kim Campbell will  be as bad, if not worse, than Brian Mulroney.  The neo-conservative agenda embraced by Campbell promotes a society where  the role of government is to promote private profit through free trade, the elimination  of universal social programs, and reduction of the labour costs (through high  unemployment and reduction of social benefits like pay equity, labour standards,  etcetera.) In other words, the neo-conservative agenda seeks to return to the pre-New  Deal days of unfettered capitalism where the market place rules, and working women  and men are persuaded that their misery and poverty must be endured to get us to a  prosperous future. The Tories have had considerable success in convincing the  political elite of the need to slash the deficit at almost any cost. But they are still having  trouble convincing the voters. Tory strategists figured that putting a fresh female face  with a smart mouth and a sense of humour on these discredited policies would  convince Canadians to swallow the bitter pill.  The strength of the women's movement and other equality-seeking movements  is a big part of the problem in selling the neo-conservative agenda. Free market forces  inevitably lead to inequality. The women's movement has focused so strongly on  Rebick continued on next page.. ..Rebick from from previous page  seeking government action, in pay equity, employment equity, labour standards, etcetera, precisely to force  employers to implement measures to increase equality in the work place. Without government intervention,  women and other disadvantaged groups in society would be much further behind than we are today.  So the Conservatives elect a woman as leader to address the concerns of women's equality hoping that  women won't notice that her policies will privilege those who already have privilege, mostly white men. With  a womanPM, it ishard to argue that women's voicesare not being heard and easier to marginalize an increasingly  radical women's movement.  Those feminists who believed that putting more women in positions of power, whether in Cabinet or in the  boardrooms, would lead to more equality for women find themselves in a quandary. They are attracted by  Campbell's talk but feel uneasy about the company she keeps and her policies. Some of these women are already  falling into the trap of the political elite. The "NAC doesn't speak for me" campaign during the referendum was  a signal that some women, who have been active in the women's movement historically, are prepared to identify  their interests with women in power and use their feminist credentials to attack the women's movement. But  many other women are feeling increasingly uncomfortable with the backlash against feminism that is being  promoted by the good feminist/bad feminist dichotomy.  With a  woman PM,  it is...easier  to marginalize  an increasingly  radical women's  movement.  Who is elected matters  As to the argument that it doesn't matter who is elected. I certainly have no illusions that the Liberals have a strong  commitment to women's equality. But the Liberals are campaigning on job creation and maintenance of social programs.  The Tories are campaigning on deficit reduction. Fighting for progressive policies will be easier with a Liberal government  than with a Tory government. However angry we are with provincial NDP governments, the current prospect of their  losing official party status is terrifying to me. The NDP inopposition has always beenastrongdefender of women's rights.  With few NDP MPs in Parliament the strength of the women's movement in lobbying on our issues will be severely  diminished.  While it is hard to see how this election will resolve anything, there is no question that a Tory majority or a Tory  minority with the Reform Party holding the balance of power will set back the cause of women's equality even further.  It is essential that women overcome our cynicism and fight as hard as we can to force the political leaders and candidates  to talk about women's issues and to answer our questions.  NAC has produced a voters' guide that provides detailed information on issues of concern to women, as well as  questions for candidates. We also have a series of fact sheets on the issues as well as an economic statement that begins  to outline alternatives to the slash and burn Tory economic agenda. We are also negotiating for a national leaders' debate  on women's issues. Whatever the outcome of this election, the women's movement should be mobilizing to ensure that  women's issues are addressed.  Post-election 1993: Do we celebrate?  In the post-election period, I believe that the strategy of the women's movement has to be four-pronged.  First, we must maintain the direction we have set in focusing on the needs of the most oppressed women. Women  will never achieve equality unless all women achieve equality.  Equality for a few women achieved on the backs of more disadvantaged women will drive all women backwards. We must continue  our struggle for universal child care, for government support to end  violence against women, for reproductive rights, against racism,  against systemic discrimination in the workplace, and the health  sphere, however strong the backlash.  »_ Secondly, the women's movement has to take on the neo-  §    conservative agenda head on and develop alternatives. Feminists  g    have to formulate our own economic strategies, based on feminist  >.   principles of social equality and sharing of wealth and power but  ■c    taking into account the current realities of international capitalism.  g    This is no easy task. The entire political spectrum has shifted to the  '1    economic right and anyone who argues a more progressive posi-  '|    tion risks marginalization.  Women's groups have usually shied  _!    away from economic debates, leaving them to others on the left, like  g    the trade union movement. We have tended to focus on economic  _    measures like pay equity and employment equity within broader  ■£   economic frameworks. But pay equity and employment equity will  s   have little impact when all wages are being driven down and the  5,   economy is being restructured to increase part-time work. Almost  half of all women in the work force today are working part-time.  Two-thirds of these would prefer full-time work if they could get  it, or if they had thechildcare they needed. The women's movement  has to put a lot more energy into developing a feminist economic strategy internationally and nationally.  During the election campaign, NAC will be producing an economic statement that attempts to begin this process. No  doubt, NAC's views on economic strategy will be of little interest to the media, just as our views on the constitution were  initially of little interest. But in the same way as we did on the Constitution—by building a democratic discussion inside  the women's movement and with our allies, to produce clear policy direction—we should be able to break through the  gender barrier in economic debates.  Thirdly, we should be focusing more attention on electoral and democratic reform. Whatever success the right may  be having in promoting deficit hysteria, the credibility of political institutions has never been lower. There is a tremendous  opportunity to propose radical reform of political institutions to ensure that they are more democratic, more accountable  and more representative.  The experience of the women's movement over the last ten years in developing a more representative movement can  help inform this discussion. At its last AGM, NAC adopted a position in favour of proportional representation in the  House of Commons and established a Task Force on electoral reform. Feminist academics have devoted considerable  energy to these issues but, so far, they have been a primarily peripheral concern of the women's movement. We have to  break down the patriarchal power structures of the state if we are ever to see a real representation of women in politics.  Applyingourunderstandingin anti-racist work, that sharing power means not only representationbutalso restructuring,  should help to inform the discussion of proposals for more democratic and representative political institutions.  Finally, we have to build an international perspective and an international women's movement. Feminists doing  international work have remarked that the issues of women in different parts of the world are becoming increasingly similar.  The drive to push back wages, working conditions and social programs impacts on women globally and thus the solution is  ultimately global in nature. There has always been a division of labour among feminists in Canada between those doing  international work and those focusing on national issues. We must unite these two groups and the NAC should be putting  a much higher emphasis on international work.  The 1995 Bejing United Nations World Conference on Women gives us an excellent framework to accelerate this work.  NAC's next AGM will focus on an international theme and, if funding is available, we hope to bring feminist leaders from  around the world to fully participate in the discussions.  NAC President Sunera Thobani and other NAC executive members will be travelling to other countries in the next few  years, to meet and discuss with feminists, particularly indeveloping countries. The greater participation of immigrant women  in mainstream women's organizations should also help to lead this process.  In many ways, I believe that Kim Campbell's election as leader of the Tories is symbolic of the limits of liberal feminism.  If we are not willing to fight for changes to the patriarchal system itself, this wave of the women's movement, like those  previous, will be driven back and equality will once again have to wait for future generations.  The rise of feminism internationally, the strength and unity of the women's movement, and the coming of age of a whole  generation of women who grew up believing in their own equality puts us in a wonderfully strong position to face the  challenges of the future, where the Kim Campbells of the world will be historical blips on the road to equality.   Judy Rebick sits on the executive of NAC as former president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women.  KINESIS  OCTOBER 1993 Commentary by Dolores Fitzgerald  It's election time. Earnest and understanding yet haunted-looking candidates  loom from our television screens wearily  conceding that the voters are a surly, suspicious and bitter lot. It's a tough time to be  a politician.  It's an even tougher time to be a voter, especially if you are a feminist voter.  There are six major parties in this year's high stakes election campaign: the Progressive  Conservatives, The New Democratic Party, The Liberals, the Reform Party, The National Party and  the Bloc Quebecois.  Even with six parties, for many of us there is a pervasive sense that there is no real choice. Voters  greet the notion that political parties will stand by their commitments with outright disbelief, if not  absolute scorn. It seems that people have lost the capacity to believe that politics can "make a  difference" in their lives.  The Kim Campbell-led Conservatives have thus far won the battle to determine the focus of the  election campaign. The deficit is a made-in-Tory-land election crusade that has dominated  Canadian consciousness for the past several years. Every party, presents a platform aimed at  eliminating the deficit: something the Conservatives, despite their supposed superior grasp of  market economics and their avowed intentions, have utterly failed to do after nine years in office.  The Tories have refined their approach in this campaign: they are refusing to even say how they will  eliminate the deficit. It's a "Trust the Tories" platform.  The New Democratic Party and the Liberals are trying furiously to undercut the Tory's  economic credibility on deficit reduction and shift the electorate's focus to the Conservatives'  perceived weaknesses: the GST, Tory unwillingness to promise immediate action on unemployment and the public's fears about cuts to social programs.  Both the NDP and the Liberals are promising to move on job creation, to protect social  programs and expand childcare funding. Both have produced detailed plans on how they will  reduce the deficit while investing in jobs, infrastructure, training and education.  The NDP are also waging a lonely battle to bring the North American Free Trade Agreement—  the deal that would make Canada, the United States and Mexico into a single trading bloc—to the  voters' attention. While this may arise from a commitment to NDP principles, their free trade focus  is also a strategy aimed at distinguishing the NDP from the Liberals, their real competition in this,  and every, election.  The Liberals have promised to re-negotiate the deal; the NDP say they will not support free  trade under any circumstances. The NDP hopes their free trade stance will gain votes in Ontario  where free trade has devastated the manufacturing sector and resulted in record unemployment.  Over the entire campaign looms the question of what effect the Reform Party, the National  Party and the Bloc Quebecois will have on the issues, the voters, the "mainstream" parties' support,  and, finally, the make-up of Canada's next Parliament.  Benefiting enormously from the election's overwhelming focus on the deficit, the Reform  Party's threat to cut into the Conservative vote is building day by day. Should Reform succeed in  winning seats, a s recent polls indicate is increasingly likely in the West and even Ontario, the spectre  of a minority government dependent on Reform support arises. A Reform-controlled minority  government will shift this country so far to the right, it will make Kim Campbell look compassionate. Reform's increased popularity also presents a direct challenge to NDP hopes of holding the  balance of power should a minority government be the election result.  The Bloc Quebecois is set to do major damage to the Conservatives' prospects of forming a  government. If current public opinion in Quebec holds, Lucien Bouchard's Bloc Quebecois' left-  leaning sovereigntist party could take up to 40 seats, likely dooming the Conservatives to a return  to the Opposition benches. Bouchard has convinced francophone voters that the separatist Bloc can  best represent Quebec's interests in a federal system. His party will not cooperate with any federal  party should a minority government scenario be in the cards.  Mel Hurtig's National Party, the newest entry in Canada's fractured body politic, is running  on a platform of increasing corporate taxes and scrapping the GST and the Canada-US Free Trade  agreement. At this point the party has nominated candidates in only 88 of the country's 295 ridings.  Although it appears the National Party will have a minimal influence on the election, it will draw  some votes from disaffected NDP and Liberal supporters.  Feminists and the NDP  Given all of the above, what are the options for feminist voters?  Many feminists are used to believing in certain electoral truisms: that the NDP will best  represent women's interests; that a vote for a Liberal is a vote for a conservative; and that the  Conservatives are a political calamity for women. Yet, in this campaign, feminists are struggling  with an increased cynicism about the political process. Many find this scepticism stretches to  include NDP promises. Feminist voters' new suspicion of the NDP parallels the attitudes of other  traditional NDP supporters: trade unionists, teachers, environmentalists and community activists.  This is particularly true for voters in the three provinces ruled by NDP governments: British  Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Between them, these provinces returned 38 of the 43 NDP  members in the 1988 federal election making NDP 1993 electoral success extraordinarily dependent  on voters from these provinces. Yet, these three governments have so alienated confirmed NDP  voters, one almost wonders whether sinister neo-conservative moles have succeeded in penetrating  every social democratic government in the country.  In BC, the touchstone issue for the disenchanted is the government's decision to allow logging  in Clayoquot Sound, which is the largest single tract of ancient temperate rainforest still intact on  Vancouver Island and a focal point for protesters all summer long. The NDP has also lost popularity  in the education and health sectors. For example, a move to bring in legislation curtailing school  strikes has resulted in a drop in teacher support, a traditionally strong NDP constituency.  Saskatchewan and Ontario, both of which are only slowly recovering from severe recessions,  have made deficit reduction policies their top priority, to the despair of trade union and other  workers who are the victims of persistent high unemployment. Ontario Premier Bob Rae's efforts  to work with public sector unions on a social contract to determine how services and jobs would  be cut to lower the provincial deficit were spectacularly unsuccessful. The Ontario NDP and labour  have suffered the most profound split in the party's history over the Social Contract legislation.  The three provincial NDP governments have been a major disappointment to progressive  voters. They have retreated on principle and on policy and, to add insult to injury, their election to  government has left feminists and the left with no progressive parliamentary opposition. Many  activists believe they have had a fresh and bitter experience of the innate corruptness of political  power.  In what is shaping up to be the toughest NDP election fight since the 1958 Progressive  Conservative landslide victory that almost saw the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation  (CCF)—the NDP's predecessor—wiped out, many NDP supporters have withdrawn to the  sidelines. While they may yet vote NDP, they can not bring themselves to volunteer for the party  A Reform-controlled  minority government  will shift this country  so far to the right,  it will make  Kim Campbell  look compassionate.  Fitzgeraldcontinued on page 16..  OCTOBER  1993  KINESIS Winnie Ng  Politician/Activist  Interview  by Kristin Wong  Winnie Ng  is a long-time  anti-racist, feminist,  union/labour activist  living in Toronto.  She is also  the New Democratic  Party candidate  for the  Trinity-Spadina riding  in Ontario  in the upcoming  federal elections.  She spoke with  Kinesis in Toronto  last month.  Kristin Wong: You have a solid reputation with the union/labour movement, as well as  the women's and anti-racist communities. Your commitment is recognized by those you  advocate on behalf of, and I, as a young Chinese-Canadian woman, believe in your  grassroots approach to tackling issues of justice and equality. But working in federal  government is an entirely different arena. What strategies have you developed to keep your  grassroots perspective intact, knowing that, if elected as a Member of Parliament, you will  be working within a huge bureaucracy that may not be compatible with your regular  working style?  Winnie Ng: That's a good question because it's one I wrestled with a lot before I made  the decision to run. Part of the way I have been able to stay grounded for all these years is  through my contact with "real people"—workers in the community and people I have  worked long and hard with on anti-racism issues.  The more I'm out in the mainstream—organizing, linking up, doing the networking—  the more I feel the need to be grounded with my own community. My main reference group  has been primarily Chinese working women, workers, and immigrant women workers.  When the NDP government was elected in Ontario, I was recruited as part of the political  staff. I worked as the executive assistant and senior policy advisor to the minister of  citizenship. That, in a way, has provided me with some insight on how the system works.  [I learnt that] we need advocates, people educating and lobbying outside the system and, at  the same time, we need people who share similar visions to be inside, making some of those  policy changes. One word in the legislation can make a lot of difference.  I recognize it will be a long, much layered process. I constantly, like right now in the  campaign, remind myself why I wanted to do this, whom I'm going to be there for. I'm very  clear. In my nomination speech, I said being an elected representative is like being a  community advocate: you use that position and those resources to keep people informed, to  get them more involved in the process, and also to provide leadership—particularly in these  recessionary times, when it's so much easier to say, "I don't care."  I would much rather be a good member of parliament in terms of constituency work,  in terms of advocating for the interests of people in the riding [than sit in on sessions and  committees in Ottawa.]  I also face a lot of hope to be a different type of leader and I'm looking forward to a  different way of doing things, a whole lot more consensus building. I'm rooted in the  community and the labour movement so if I'm being sidelined, I won't sit there quietly.  Wong: If elected as a member of parliament, not only will you be the only Chinese-  Canadian woman in the House of Commons, you will be the first Chinese-Canadian woman  ever elected in federal politics. Does knowing that place additonal pressure on you?  Ng: Yes. [Laughs] It's driving me to work harder. I know there are a lot of expectations,  that a lot of people [think] it's time the dial turned. But while I'm honoured to be, as you put  it, the first Chinese-Canadian woman running for the House of Commons, I'm also angry  and saddened it's taken our community 130 years [to get there.] It had better not be the same  for my daughter.  Rosemary Brown [a Black woman recently appointed as Ontario Human Rights  Commissioner] said: Our lives have been made a bit more meaningful by women who  walked those corridors before us. Well, we will continue to keep the doors open and I think  it will be easier for the others to come in.  Wong: Here comes the "token" question: Often, certain "visible minority" persons are  selected by politicians and mainstream media to be the official spokespeople for their  respective communities. Do you see yourself being put in the position to serve the national  Chinese constituency as well as your Trinity-Spadina riding?  Ng: It would be presumptuous of me to say I can speak on behalf of the whole Chinese-  Canadian community. No one can do that. There is diversity within the Chinese community.  My representation will be there for those who are more progressive. Hopefully, I will be able  to present an alternate vision, one that wants a whole lot more in terms of where we're going.  But I'm finding that, even as a candidate, I'm asked to make comments on immigration  and refugee policies while other candidates probably aren't being asked. It happens even  within the party.  I do have sensitivity for these issues. For example the Head Tax issue is one I feel  passionate about. [The Chinese community has been seeking redress from the Tory government since 1984 for the Head Tax, or entry tax, imposed on Chinese immigrants to Canada  between 1885 and 1923.]  On the other hand, it's also incumbent upon other politicians to learn. I don't mind being  the advocate, but I work to influence and to broaden the circle so other people don't have to  be from a minority background to be comfortable and competent in speaking on the issues.  I also recognize how many additional barriers we, as "minority" candidates, face in a  campaign, in overcoming and trying to gain support. I tip my hat to Chinese-Canadian  candidates of all political stripes. It's not easy. We can prepare ourselves psychologically for  all sorts of comments, but when racist comments are made, it hurts. That's the additional  hurdle, aside from the politics.  Wong: It occurs to me that when non-"visible minority" politicians and candidates  address issues of racism, it could be seen as more valid than when you do, that you, as a  Chinese-Canadian woman, could be seen as being a "special interest" group.  Ng: Yes. And I don't want to be typecast to become the only one who can speak on  minority issues, because then it becomes like a broken record. It doesn't do justice to what  I can offer. I come out from a labour background. I'm just as confident and comfortable  speaking on labour or free trade [as racism.]  Whatever the issues are, I'd like the perspectives of minorities and of women to be  included as part of the mainstream, not seen as sidestreams or whatever-streams. They are  all political issues, they are all First People's issues. Workers of colour and immigrant women  workers are the most hard hit by Free Trade and the job situation. These are not monolithic  workers' issues, but one that brings in different perspectives.  Wong: Going back to the Head Tax, what is your official stance on it? I understand that the Chinese  Canadian National Council has been doing a lot of work since 1984, lobbying the government on all levels  for compensation and an apology [for the imposition of the head tax (1885-1923) and the Chinese Exclusion  Act (1923-1947) which prevented any Chinese immigration to Canada for a quarter of a century.] How do  you feel about this issue, especially in this interview for Kinesis, a Vancouver-based feminist newspaper with  a lot of Chinese readers.  Ng: My position is that, aside from the official apology, basically what the Tory government and [former  prime minister] Brian Mulroney offered the people this summer is an insult. He offfered us an apology, [but  refused to pay compensation for the $23million in Head Tax the government collected from Chinese  immigrants.] That's missing the point. It says we could be bought [as labour for buildingCanadian railroads]  and that's it. We're asking for compensation, both individually and as a community. And [the government]  continues to say, "Well, these are people who wanted to come, they came willingly. No one forced them to  pay."  You have to look at it in a broader perspective. The Chinese were the only ones who have had a tax  imposed [to emigrate in Canada.] At the same time, [the government] was using the money they collected  from the Head Tax to encourage Europeans to come into Canada to settle, and to give them crown land and  free transportation. So it's not just an immigration issue. It's important for the federal government to set the  record straight so future generations won't repeat that again.  Election time is a good time to be a whole lot more creative about issues like this. Yet the Tory  Government is taking advantage of the fact that, because we're in a recessionary time, people may not dare  to raise the issue of compensation. We have to join hands with the Italian and Ukrainian communities [who  are also seeking redress,] to make sure this issue doesn't get sidelined.  Wong: How do you feel about the increasing numbers of women running for government, in particular,  for federal seats?  Ng: It's important to have more women representation. Women constitute 52 percent of our Canadian  population and our representation is only about 13 percent. I think women also treat politics differently. And  by having more women run, we also have the opportunity to make different choices: you don't need Kim  Campbell-type women...  Wong: ...or the Margaret Thatchers...  Ng: ...yes, who don't have that feminist vision. I believe it's important to encourage more women from  different political ideologies and approaches to run. [An election] can be run differently and bring different  choices, so that it's not simply about being "a woman" that will be on a candidate's agenda, but about what  that means, and how that [reflects] on her politics and approach.  is like being a community advocate: you  ...bein  use that position and those resources to keep people informed, to get them  more involved in the process, and also to provide leadership...  Wong: What do you think of feminism and the role the women's movement has played in issues of human  rights, immigration, and the national deficit? Women are saying, "We're not just going to talk about immigrants,  refugees, domestic violence." Does feminism actually play a role in national deficit reducing?  Ng: I would hope so. When you hear Kim Campbell say her number one priority is to cut the deficit, and at  the same time say [she's] not going to raise taxes or create new jobs, the only other alternative [to pay of f the deficit]  is by cutting spending. When you cut spending, most of the time it's the "soft" programs that are cut: health care  programs, or the child care programs which the Tory government reneged on in 1992. And particularly in  recessionary times, it is women and children who suffer the most. This is a feminist perspective on poverty, yet  it hasn't been brought to the forefront.  The economy and the deficit have always been approached from a very monolithic type of definition—that  the deficit is only about figures. Yet you also have the human cost, the human deficit side. When you consider  a child growing up, being propped in front of the TV all the time, or when you consider a child growing up with  hunger, what is the long term cost in terms of a deficit in that regard?  Women have not really been included at the table [nor] have been part of the decison-making process. The  way our national economy and our gross national product have been calculated are very much male-  dominated. Women's work at home, for example, has never been counted as valuable. [Another example is] the  environment: when there's an oil spill, the clean-up cost is counted as productive labour. But when the  environment is clean, that's not counted as anything. It's the same thing with women.  Look at the garment industry: why do we keep saying that making a simple piece of fabric into a suit is a low-  value job? When we're talking about high-value, it's always about high-tech [jobs.] Yet turning a piece of fabric  into a garment is also a very complicated process. That job is being undervalued and it's because normally, this  is work women do, and women are not always included as part of mainstream economics. So if more women  are involved with politics, then we will keep bringing up issues such as pay equity and value of women's work.  Wong: Speaking of pay equity, all of the three provinces that have NDP governments—Saskatchewan, British  Columbia and Ontario—have not yet adequately addressed issues of pay equity, even though there are strong  women's voices suchas yours in the NDP caucus lobbying from within. Many women are concerned about this—  in fact, the NDP has lost considerable support from women's communities over lack of action on these issues.  Another issue has been that of lesbian and gay rights, around the lack of laws on same-sex spousal benefits,  particularly in Ontario. __  Ng: I'm not going to defend the goverment there. There are different types of politicians. I believe strongly  that, much as we have a political vision, elected representatives also need to have the political will and the courage  to carry that vision through. ~" —.  Idon'tblame people forbeing cynical: thereare so many conformists.ajtound.rm hoping that, in this [federal]  election, people will select candidates more carefully, more closely, and ultimately get down to questions of trust  and how to make elected representatives more accountable. In Ontario, the women's community and the labour  movement all had the illusion that, "Oh, once we've got our NDP government, things are going to be different,"  without doing all it takes to keep the goverment in check.  Wong: How will you use political office to bring about social change and justice, espcially for those who have  historically been marginalized and people whoare historically disadvantaged, such as women, lesbians and gays,  and people with disabilities?  Ng: As I said earlier, my sense of running in this election is that we [need] like-minded people who share the  same vision to be in the House of Commons. Women, especially women of colour, have to be clear as to why we  want to be there and to know who we are there'for. In a way, it's trying to redefine power on our own terms and  I hope, with my years of experience in working with the different groups, to be able to articulate, not just the  concerns but the interests of peoples in these groups. By the way, I don't see all these groups as "special interest  groups," because if we add the numbers together, we are the majority. I believe that having more people like  ourselves at the table helps to open up the circle. I've said in speeches that we're not here to take over, we just want  to take our place.

OCTOBER 1993  OCTOBER 1993 ..Fitzgerald from page 13  during this year's campaign. In a tight election race, it is the election day volunteers and their  ability to pull out the vote that ultimately decides who goes to Ottawa.  What does the NDP stand for?  Current polls predict that the NDP, which held 43 seats at the election call, is at a historic low  in public support and will be lucky to return even five MPs. Even Leader Audrey McLaughlin's  Yukon seat is no longer considered a safe bet. And, in an early election campaign comment,  McLaughlin seemed to acknowledge the party's losses as inevitable when she outlined the major  condition the NDP would demand from the Liberals—termination of free trade agreements—in  return for supporting a Liberal minority government.  The NDP's battle for voters, and for survival, is not with the Tories. To prevent electoral  disaster, the NDP must achieve victory over the Liberals, the classic foe their less committed  supporters turn to when a vote for the NDP is perceived as a "wasted vote." A dramatic example  of this phenomenon was reflected in the NDP's showing in the recent Alberta provincia 1 election.  In that contest, Alberta voters, dreading the possibility of a Ralph Klein Progressive Conservative  government, turned overwhelmingly to the Liberals with the result that the NDP dropped from  being Alberta's official opposition party with 16 seats to not electing a single member.  It is mainly these dynamics—the acute alienation of many of the NDP's strongest supporters  and the potential defection to the Liberals of the party's less committed supporters—that makes  this election such a threat to the future of the NDP.  The NDP is also suffering from another major problem: voters say they are having a hard time  determining exactly what the party stands for. While the NDP argues this is due to the media's  superficial leader-focused campaign coverage and says that voters eventually will get their  message, it's hard to pick the NDP out of the pack since the party has also bought into the election's  deficit reduction theme. While the NDP is distinguished from other parties by their "no cuts to  social programs" pledge, the party has not been able to make the future of social programs a key  election issue.  In this campaign, NDP insiders are quoted in the mainstream press as nervously hoping, at  best, to elect 12 members of parliament, thereby protecting their status as an official party in the  House of Commons. Taking fewer than 12 seats means the party would lose funding for research  budgets, staff, etc. Taking less than 12 seats would launch the NDP on a perilous and, perhaps,  a hopeless journey back to political respectability and influence.  This federal election campaign is a tremendously high stakes encounter for Canadians.  Conservative economic ideology has captured the political agenda to a degree that is almost  unprecedented in Canadian history.  Should the Progressive Conservatives' return to power with a majority mandate, they would  be free to cap their nine-year restructuring of Canadian society by moving on their remaining  agenda items, chiefly the dismantlement of social programs. The Tories have adamantly refused  to reveal any policy on the future of social programs. Commentators from across the political  spectrum agree, however, that Tory promises to eliminate the deficit in five years can only be  accomplished by massive cuts in unemployment benefits, old age pensions and welfare programs, and further cuts to social service and education transfer payments to the provinces.  A majority Liberal government will likely lead Canada down the same path. While the Liberal  platform sounds more humane, in fact leader Jean Chretien is equally adept at avoiding discussion  of policy detail. His pledge to eliminate the GST comes with no alternative aimed at replacing GST  revenue. His promise to re-negotiate free trade has been undermined by American reaction; they  say they will not re-negotiate. We can see the seeds of a Liberal turnaround. In keeping with Liberal  tradition, their excuse will be they "... had no option."  A minority government is the best that can be hoped for in terms of blocking a continued  right-wing economic agenda, but even that scenario is fraught with peril for "ordinary Canadians." If the Reform Party should hold the balance of power in a minority parliament, our economic  and social landscape will be clearcut: a slash and burn spectacle on a national scale.  Where do we stand?  In this election, the task is clear.  We need to stand against the brave, new, all-Canadian, globally-competitive,  high-tech, restraint-driven, program-cutting society that neo-conservative economic  doctrine has made so frighteningly pervasive.  We need to counter the harsh "deficit reduction at any price" theme that has so  captured an angry and disillusioned electorate. This theme's corollary for individual  Canadians, "we-can-take-care-of-ourselves-Jack-cut-back-those-taxes," denotes a  silent sanction of our country becoming an abundant land for the prosperous and a  hopeless one for the impoverished.  We need to change the theme and send a message to the powers that be, that we  are still vitally committed to the essential Canadian values that dedicate us to taking  care of one another.  And so we come to appraise the NDP, the party feminists have always  considered the progressive alternative, the real parliamentary opposition. While we  know the other electoral "options" are frightening, can we count on the NDP?  We consider the failures and betrayals of NDP provincial governments and we  know there is no way we can excuse them. We speculate on why the NDP is unwilling  to articulate a genuine alternative vision for Canada. We wonder whether we are  prepared to continue trusting that they represent their allies.  Fear of the disappearance of the NDP as a social democratic political alternative  wells up. What is the cost of cutting the party loose? What would be the price of  saying, in the 1970s words of American feminist Robin Morgan, "Goodbye to all  that...?"  We think about what's at stake. What are the prospects for the "have not"  provinces, the devastated regions, the wasted no-work towns and the people  watching their future disappear? We dream about having a real opposition, an opposition in the  streets.  A mid-campaign direct mail fund-raising appeal arrives in some mailboxes. The NDP appeal,  looking for the precise emotional button to push, zeros in on fear. Its outer envelope asks potential  donors whether the can "Imagine a Parliament without New Democrats to Speak for Us." At this  point in the election campaign, it is entirely imaginable.  What seems far more unimaginable to long time feminist NDP voters is how incessantly  another question intrudes. Can we still believe voting for the NDP will "make a difference?"  If you can believe, vote NDP and work on an NDP campaign.  Dolores Fitzgerald returns as a writer for Kinesis after a long, long absence.  We dream  about having  a real opposition,  an opposition in  the streets.  NDP leader Audrey McLaughlin chatting with the  Vancouver Lesbian Centre's Monica Chappie at a  recent meeting with lesbian, gay and bisexual  community groups in Vancouver  OCTOBER 1993 Commentary  by Shelagh Day  Kim Campbell's longest held and most high  profile Cabinet position was as Minister of Justice. Examining her record in that portfolio provides helpful insights into who she is and how  she works. When assessing her as a politician, it  is important to look at her words, her actions,  and what "fit" there is between the two.  Women cannot forget that Kim Campbell's first action as Minister of Justice was to  introduce and passionately defend a bill to recriminalize abortion [see Kinesis, Dec/Jan 89J  even though she proclaims herself pro-choice. To justify this evident contradiction, she  argued that recriminalizing abortion was necessary because otherwise the provinces would  be free to restrict access to abortion. Her argument is nonsense. Making abortion a crime once  more would do nothing to stop provinces from trying to restrict access to abortion services.  But the passionate inside-out logic which Campbell used in this case is characteristic of  her. Repeatedly, she attempts to put a progressive face on regressive initiatives.  There are many examples of this lack of fit between what Campbell says and does. Like  the two Ministers of Justice before her, she promised to amend the Canadian Human Rights  Act to strengthen the rights of persons with disabilities and to include sexual orientation as  a prohibited ground of discrimination [see Kinesis, May/92.]  But the amendments Campbell introduced were not an improvement to our human  rights, but a retrenchment of those rights. The proposed amendments did not strengthen the  rights of persons with disabilities, they weakened them. Though she did propose to add  sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination, she limited the protection so that  employers could continue to refuse employment benefits to lesbians and gay men.  The amendments also undermined many other existing rights, including the right to  equal pay for work of equal value and the right to challenge discriminatory immigration  policies. In addition, the amendments failed to respond effectively to a long-standing  demand from Aboriginal women that the Canadian Human Rights Act be made to apply to  the Indian Act so that women living on reserves could have greater protection from  discrimination.  It is little wonder that women's and other equality-seeking groups quickly decided to say  "thanks, but no thanks" to Campbell's amendments.  Campbell also vigorously defended cancellation of the Court Challenges Program, and  was openly hostile to those who drew attention to the cancellation's devastating impact on  access to justice for women and members of other disadvantaged groups [see Kinesis, Oct/92. ]  The Court Challenges Program provided funding to allow disadvantaged groups to pursue  court challenges under the equality rights provision of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  At the same time, more quietly, she tried to signal that she was not responsible for the  cancellation, or had not known about it beforehand, or was out of the Cabinet room when it  happened. Again, she seemed to want it all ways: to treat the Program as a hostile force in her  role as Minister of Justice and be a loyal defender of the decision to cancel it, and yet to signal  to her critics that she might personally be more liberal on the matter. (Because of her record  on this question, her pre-election announcement that she will reinstate some version of the  Court Challenge Program should be viewed with extreme caution. There is good reason to  fear that any new version will be a much weakened and constrained program.)  Perhaps Campbell's logic has been most twisted and her dishonesty as a politician has  been most blatant on the issue of rights for lesbians and gay men. While repeatedly declaring  herself sympathetic to the cause of lesbians and gay men, she introduced amendments to the  Canadian Human Rights Act which, as noted already, hurt rather than helped. She also  directed her officials in Justice to fight every legal challenge to homophobic government  policies brought by lesbians and gay men.  Even before the amendments were introduced, she defended the continuing lack of  protection for lesbians and gay men on the grounds that lesbians and gay men are protected  by the Charter. She then defended the cancellation of the Court Challenges Program on the  grounds that the Canadian Human Rights Act could effectively deal with the problems  Canadians have with equality, so access to the Charter was not necessary. But that leaves  lesbians with no protection under the Human Rights Act and no access to the Charter!  Campbell's willingness to make any argument at all in defence of her actions makes her  seem like the shell game artist at the carnival whose hands can move so quickly that we lose  sight of which shell covers the pea. As a politician, Campbell must hope that, if she makes  enough deft twists and turns in logic, we will be unable to detect the emptiness of what she  offers us. Then there was the new rape law.  These are the bad parts of the record: what about the rape shield law? This was the one  occasion when Kim Campbell responded to the demands of women who met with her in  January 1992 to outline their responses to the proposed new law [see Kinesis, Feb/92.] Of  course, it is women who deserve the credit for shaping the improvements to the law but  Campbell deserves credit for having listened to women's demands.  Given this, what do we have as a record: an attempt to recriminalize abortion (defeated  in the Senate); gun control legislation that does not control Mark Lepine's gun (passed);  proposed human rights amendments that are a harm not a help (they did not get second  reading—a new government will have to decide to pass, reject or shelve the amendments),  cancellation of the Court Challenges Program (reintroduction of which is a recent election  promise), opposition to aboriginal women being at the Constitutional Table (still being  fought by the Native Women's Association of Canada in court), little change to show from  the much-touted Symposium on Women, Law and Administration of Justice, a list of  regressive positions taken in the courts on equality rights cases, and the amended sexual  assault law.  From this, women can conclude that Kim Campbell is an unreliable ally for women at  best, and in the main, likely to be a threat to the equality gains we have made. We have seen  that her words and her actions often do not match, and that her positions are regressive,  though she likes to play, like a trickster, at sounding progressive.  Campbell's willingness  to make any argument  at all in defence  of her actions  makes her seem like  the shell game artist  at the carnival  whose hands  can move so quickly  that we lose sight  of which shell  covers the pea.

OCTOBER 1993 Arts  Review: Curator Andrea Fatona's  Queer Collaborations  by Larissa Lai  QUEER COLLABORATIONS  Basic Inquiry Studio, Vancouver  August 13-27  Queer Collaborations was curated with  the intention of opening up dialogue around  the issues and problems of artistic cross-  cultural collaboration.  Andrea Fatona, a Black lesbian curator,  culled the work of two white lesbian artists  who take photographs of white lesbians and  lesbians of colour. Her strategy, to foreground the racial and sexual identities of  herself, the artists and their subjects/collaborators, is innovative. It challenges us to  look beyond the artwork as precious objects  in themselves. In Queer Collabora tions, Fatona  makes the context in which the artworks  appear the focus of the exhibition. The Black  lesbian curator becomes the creative driving  force—the curator becomes the "artist."  The issues that Fatona is challenging us  to address include those of neo-colonialism,  ownership, anthropology, the gaze of the  viewer,consumer and critic,and much more.  Because of the inherent racist power  dynamics within the mainstream Canadian  art world, it is not often that a Black lesbian  curator is in the position of curating the  works of white lesbian artists. What can this  mean in terms of how the images on display  are read? It is not often, either, that white  artists photograph women of colour with  the intention to seriously interrogate their  own racism. What can this mean in terms of  how the images are read?  One of Fatona's goals in assembling this  exhibition was to raise questions, and to  provoke discussion: What is the responsibility of the photographer in relation to her  subject?  Can the power imbalance between the  photographer and the photographed be dismantled or at least minimized?  Are the photographers and subject/collaborators accountable to their communities?  And what is their responsibility to the  communities in which they place their work  to be viewed? What is the responsibility of  the woman of colour subject/collaborators  to her communities, when she chooses to  work with white women?  How can the woman of colour collaborator be true to herself—her self perception,  her fantasies and her desires—when working with a white photographer? Can she do  thiswithoutreconstitutingracistperceptions  of herself and other women of colour? How  can the white lesbian photographer be true  to her subject?  And how can women of colour critique  one another's work and political choices  without undermining one another, or offer-  ingone another as canon fodder for the racist  right?  Fatona's work is empowering in that it  allows these questions to be asked on her  own terms, in a context in which she, as a  Black lesbian, has constructed.  Many of the viewers with whom I spoke,  expressed a deep concern about the dangers  of publicly criticizing the show: Whose interests would it serve? Does the empowerment of being able to publicly discuss and  critique the concept outweigh the danger of  the dialogue being appropriated to serve the  interests of racist reactionaries? Yet not to  raise questions is to defeat the purpose of the  show.  And where should these questions be  raised? Is Kinesis, a feminist newspaper with  roots in a white feminist movement, appro  priate? How does the fact that the current  staff are women of colour change that history? Or should these discussions take place  only in the "safe" havens of the living rooms  of women of colour?  The problem with asking these questions is that it doesn't get us anywhere unless  one can begin to answer them, however  imperfectly, and make the choice to act.  The same concerns might be raised with  regard to the curation of the show. On the  left hand side of the gallery were photographs taken by Vancouver lesbian feminist  photographer Susan Stewart, best known  for her work with the Kiss and Tell Collective. The subject/collaborators were: Helga,  Shanti, Miss Taree, Iris Fabiola and River  Sui.  Stewart's name is emblazoned on the  wall in large white letters in relief. During a  discussion group in August, a week after the  show opened, Stewart explained her process. Recognizing the power imbalance which  is intrinsic to the relationship between the  photographer and the photographed, she  actively sought ways to relinquish as much  of that power as possible: each subject/  collaborator was to decide on the way she  would like to be photographed, provide her  own props and costumes, and direct the  shoot as much as possible.  Stewart's portion of the show included  an audiotape that viewers could listen to  while they looked at the works. The listener  hears the subjects, the artist and the curator  talk about their lives, the choices they have  made with regard to how they represented  themselves, and the process of creating images.  In all of these images, the subject/collaborators use material props that seem to be  racial signifiers: fans, veils, traditional clothing, masks, switchblades, and steel piping  that is highly reminiscent of bamboo. On a  second look, the viewer has to ask questions  as to whether these props are "authentic," or  whether they are being reclaimed from a  white Western iconography of the so-called  "East." But, what is authentic anyway, when  we too have grown up with mainstream  Western iconographies? (Can we really call  them "white" anymore?) Many of us have  learned to identify with Hollywood ways of  seeing ourselves, albeit with much ambivalence. Is it possible to reclaim those signifiers  without reinscribing a racist perception of  ourselves? And reinscribe for whom? Or are  we creating a language of complacency, one  that allows us to reclaim these images yet not  move beyond to a language of resistance—  of inscription, not reinscription?  On the opposite side of the gallery are  portraits taken by Marina Dodis. The subjects were: Gae, Kelly, Jackie & Mia, Brenda,  Cynthia, Di and Meegan. While Stewart's  work made extensive use of props, Dodis'  used none at all. Each subject was shot against  a stark white background. Thus, she explained during the discussion group, how  each subject comes across is entirely dependent upon the subject's own actions. Or  is it?  While Stewart's work could have been  about the interrogation of racial signifiers,  Dodis' is more about their absence. In Dodis'  photographs, the clothes are the only  "props." Still the danger is of a whitewash  looming close—a whitewash that conceals  the fact that how the subject presents herself  to the camera has everything to do with the  presence of the camera.  The combination of voyeurism and systemic racism can be a lethal cocktail. In her  review of the show in Angles, a gay and  lesbian newspaper in Vancouver, Laiwan  suggests: "There is a danger that these photographers are unintentionally tapping into  the white legacy of anthropology/ethnography in their work and that the practice of  photography alone is highly problematic."  One viewer, who asked not to be identified, was concerned that the images  reinscribe racial stereotypes; the fact that the  participants and the photographers considered questions of race and representation  when creating the works is all the more  disheartening because the visible result is no  different than had they not considered the  issue at all.  Another viewer, Shani Mootoo, suggests that the intention of the photographer  might not count for much in real terms, as  long as the act of looking remains the domain of white people.  The advertising of the show was troubling in that only the two white lesbian  photographers are named, while the curator  and the subject/collaborators are not. Perhaps inadvertently, the emphasis was placed  (again) on the process of the white artists. It  was unfortunate that most of the subject/  collaborators were unable to attend the discussion group. Three were present, and  spoke briefly about the process.  Helga  Fatona selected works from Stewart's  solo show to be launched at the Or Gallery in  October, entitled Lowers and Warriors.  "That was the show the photographs  were taken for," explains collaborator/subject River Sui. "For me it was a game about  fantasy. Four years ago, I would have chosen to be as un-Chinese as possible. Now  [my Chinese identity] is empowering. It's  not that any of us [women of colour] didn't  know better [in choosing to be photographed  as wedid]. That's whatreality is for usat this  point. These images are part of our process  of coming home.  "But the process would have been more  comfortable if Susan [Stewart] had been a  woman of colour," Sui adds.  Cynthia Low, who worked with photographer Marina Dodis says, "I saw [Dodis]  as a vehicle for me to be documented. She  was facilitating something that I enjoyed  doing," she says. Low adds that she did  wonder, however, why Fatona was making  yet more space for white lesbian artists.  Viewer Kathy March says, "I'm afraid  of judging [women of colour] and the choices  they make. [These choices are] not as simple  as right and wrong."  Stewart admits she would have made  very different work had she been producing  it specifically for Queer Collaborations.  But, says viewer Susanda Yee, "It's important to begin at the beginning, meaning  you have to have an anti-racist agenda in the  forefront of your mind from the very start of  any project. It may change the whole method  or even the entire premise of the show."  Mootoo says she respects Stewart as a  lesbian artist who is strongly invested in the  white lesbian and lesbian of colour communities. But she suggests that white women  are not and cannot be as concerned or embedded in anti-racist politics as women of  colour because there is less at stake for them  directly.  "If the camera is such an oppressive  tool, then I'm tempted to say: Don't use it,"  she says.  Curator Fatona says that her primary  intention in assembling Queer Collaborations  was to stimulate dialogue. In this, the show  has been successful. All the women who  took part in the show and who spoke about  it were courageous. There is no comfortable  or safe territory. Fatona's work sets a precedent for shows in the future, where the  contexts may be different, but could be carefully considered. Rather than the show being a forum in which artists can place their  work, it creates a forum in which dialogue  can take place.   Larissa Lai is a Vancouver writer and cultural  worker.  OCTOBER 1993 Arts  Interview with Dionne Brand:  Owning the language  by Lynne Wanyeki, Nikola Maria De  Marin and Charmaine Perkins  Dionne Brand spoke with Kinesis in Vancouver last month. Part two of this interview  will appear in the next issue o/Kinesis.  Lynne Wanyeki: You describe yourself  and your work as a Black lesbian feminist.  What does that naming mean to you?  Dionne Brand: That naming is a declaration. It's important to me to say something  about the intersection of those things with a  world that's quite opposite to them.  So, "Black" [distinguishes me] from  "white" and white ruling structures and  white rule, the awful destructiveness we've  had on the planet since European colonialism. "Black" also distinguishes me as being  part of the movement of the 60s and 70s, and  distinguishing ourselves from our oppressors.  "Lesbian" distinguishes  me from those who  make heterosexuality  compulsory—but more  than that, [those who]  prohibit the loving of  women.  "Lesbian" distinguishes me from those  who makeheterosexuality compulsory—but  more than that, [those who] prohibit the  loving of women. We live in a very woman-  hating culture and, at a fundamental level,  that's what patriarchy means. The notion of  loving women is anathema to the woman-  hating culture we belong to. And we're [not  only] talking about sexual love, we're also  talking about a political love for that group  of people which finds themselves so put-  upon.  And, "feminist," distinguishes me from  tha t line again. Everything within the sphere  that I declare, speaks directly and clearly to  whatl disagree with and directly and clearly  to what I want to make. I want to make a  place where women are not hated, I want to  make a place where Black people are not  hated, and I want to make a place where  people are not hated. "Black lesbian feminist" is a declarative statement for those  inside those parameters and for those outside of it who seek to try to destroy that  notion.  Wanyeki: What would you say the  meaning is inside the parameters [of the  Black lesbian feminist community]?  Brand: I think part of that whole European colonial project was not only the economic and brutish conquest of place but the  attempt to try to conquer the minds and  spirits of those peoples it encountered—You  can't do one without the other because to be  continually brutish takes a lot of time, energy and money. So, they had to take a hold  of those people'sminds and turn them against  themselves...a self-hate against themselves.  All the school systems we have gone to,  all the educative processes which they quickly  instituted, have been about our destruction.  We've sat in classrooms and just got destroyed, about who we are and how much  less of humankind we are as women and as  people of colour. The British education, for  example, is an incredibly wide-ranging one.  It went to India, to Africa, to East Asia. It's  massive and we all learned the same things.  I've made friends from all over the world  and we've compared notes on primary  texts—we learned the same damn things.  We know the same songs, we've drunk the  same condensed milk. Our colonization was  really thorough.  What we try to do inside of those contexts is to take ourselves back—at a deeply  poetic level, to love ourselves back into existence. So what's inside the parameters [is not  just] resistance to that patriarchal project  and that woman-hating project, but also just  drawing ourselves back, grafting ourselves  back, and loving ourselves into a presence.  Wanyeki: In a lot of your stories, poetry  and films, the recurrent theme is documenting Black women's lives, especially, Black  working women's lives. Could you talk about  that?  Brand: It's that same project of loving  ourselves into existence. In all media, we do  not have a presence, or our presence is subject to whatever the white characters in them  need. That's true of documentary and feature films, novelsas well asnon-fiction works.  I want to write, film, talk about us as the  subjects of our own lives, as the speakers in  our own discourses, as the centre of things.  In my poetry, for example, I'm trying to  perfect that woman's voice—not a woman's  voice, because that's too massive—but that  woman's voice that I am. I'm trying to make  that voice the centre of the talk.  I come out of a Black culture where male  voices dominate, they are the ones supposed  to be expert in the discourse, expert on all  subjects. Early in my writing, in the struggle  for Black liberation I felt myself a part of and  felt was necessary for my own life, I dealt  largely with what you can describe as Black  subject—genderless Black subject, which is,  after all, male Black subject. It's a subject that  really doesn't see women or the interactions  between Black men and Black women as  subject, and doesn't see agency in black  women, orexamine male subjectas the voice  [of Black subject].  But as I became a feminist, I became  increasingly uncomfortable with that construction of Black male subject. I didn't really know in the beginning where I was  going to head with it. [I knew only] that it  wasn't my voice. And not just that, I knew  that something wasn't being said because it  didn't think itself important enough.  Interestingly enough, when I look back  at some of that work, it is very cautious  about the roles designated for women and  the roles designated for sexuality. I realize I  actually say in poems that I don't want  anything inside of me that hates me. There  are lines that show that I was questioning or  not prepared to give all that ground.  I think I've started in No Language Is  Neutral to speak from that woman's voice.  One not so good book of mine, Primitive  Offensive, [on] the passage and movement of  enslaved Black people from Africa to the  Caribbean, tries to do an account through an  old woman's voice. I think that's what started  [it for] me. I don't think it was a very good  book, but perhaps that was because I was  working out how that voice would sound.  In No Language Is Neutral, I'm hoping  [that voice] begins to sound like a woman  who thinks and knows that she can be the  speaker for a Black subject as legitimately as  any male subject can.  Wanyeki: In termsof activistwork, where  has the process that you were talking about  in your writing, of coming to your own  voice, pushed you to work now?  Brand: Well, in the late 70s, I worked  with mixed groups of men and women.  What happened to me from the 70s to the 80s  is that I began to work increasingly with  women only—with women of colour and  immigrant women.  After I'd done that for about 10 years, I  walked into a room with men one day and  was shocked: "Oh shit, this is what this used  to be." You know what I mean? I had been so  Brand speaking at UBC  much in women's collectives and things like  that. Then I finally go back into a room with  men in the community and see all the posturing and the delay, and the not getting  anything done... I guess feminists have their  own kind of delay—everybody has to agree,  nobody candecide—but in groups with men,  they want to decide, they do little dances  about who's going to decide between the  men at the table. And women look with  resignation, they sigh but they are tolerant  and kind and motherly to them. And I  thought, I can't do this. But that was the role  of the women in that mixed organizing  group. And it took so long, [but] you didn't  get fulfilled out of it: you got sidelined out of  it.  So I began increasingly in the 80s to  work only with women, like the immigrant  women's centre and the International Women's Day committees and then, in the late,  late 80s, with a group called the Black Women's Collective in Toronto. We began to organize in the Black community as feminists.  We would go into mixed spaces and make  points, we would go into white feminist  spaces and do that, and we would also try to  make a space of our own.  We didn't shirk the notion of being  feminist or the title of being feminist. We did  several years of good organizing, including  forming other kinds of women's organizations. Likeone where the youngblack woman  got shot by a cop. We and some other women  of colour spearheaded a group called Women  Against Racism and Police Violence. That is  still going, and we're not even in it.  What we were trying to do was to suggest to all of those communities that they  didn't own the space, tha t we were not going  to tolerate the ways in which they'd tried to  split up our sexuality from our gender from  our race, that we were going to act and be  activists in any of those spheres.  In the 90s, I haven't done much community organizing because I've been employed  full-time, I'm not [living] in Toronto, and  [I've been] making the film and so on. I've  done more creative work. I wrote No Language Is Neutral, and the oral histories of  Black working women, and I did the three  films. That's been my activism for that period.  I miss the actual [organizing], and it's  something that I'm going to go back to because I don't see how I can not do that kind  of work. But there's also a time to do creative  kinds of things—I think you need to do that  too to nurture yourself and also to do what  you say you want to do, like build the place  you want to live in. Otherwise you have no  vision of what it is [going to be.] The films  and the books are bits of my vision of how  it's going to be someday, somehow.  Nikola Maria De Marin: How do you  validate creativity as a form of activism?  Brand: We have to be cautious about  that. I've been extremely cautious, sometimes too cautious. I'vealways had the struggle about actual activism—actual organizing of people in various arenas against racism and writing. I thought it was either one  or the other, because the act of writing seems  so passive. With the everyday attacks that  you come under as a people, you feel you  have to be out there: I have to go in those  rooms, I have to do something, I have to go  on the street and I have to go in front of the  South African Embassy. You know.  But I think also, on some level, it's a kind  of false dichotomy. It's necessary to do [creative] work too, but it's possible to find yourself alienated from a community [doing that].  I don't want to propose being a writer as  some elevated act of activism, because it  isn't. There is that tendency, simply because  writing is seen as intellectual activity and, in  this society, intellectual activity takes hierarchical power over actual activity, the real  and the physical.  But that link has to be kept because,  without that community, you ain't doing  shit anyway. Who are you talking to anyway  if you're not speaking to, through, from and  against it?  I don't want my role as a writer to be  somehow elevated above what I would have  been if I worked counselling a woman at the  immigrant women's centre. It's the same  kind of work.  I want to write, film, talk  about us as the subjects  of our own lives, as the  speakers in our own  discourses, as the  centre of things.  So finally, I've understood that there  isn't really a struggle between writing and  activism if the project is the same. I just don't  want to fall into the trap of starting to believe  that my work was much more important  than any kind of organizing outside the  House of Parliament. And not to fall into the  trap also means not to have white people co-  opt you into falling into that trap.  Wanyeki: I'd like to go back to the act of  naming. In Vancouver, we use the terms  "women of colour" and "First Nations  women" to denote our respective struggles  OCTOBER 1993 Arts  and communities. But in Toronto, I notice  the naming mainly seems to be "Black  women" and "women of colour." Could  you talk a bit about the history of those  particular terms and communities?  Brand: I think there are problems with  that [naming] but I can only talk about how  I and other Black women in Toronto named  ourselves. It goes back to what I said earlier  about coming out of that [Black] movement  [of the 50s and 60s]. We come out of a very  activist community...Black community organizing grew out of Black communities'  apprehension of how the State was going to  deal with us and our own knowledge of our  history of enslavement and soon. Weorgan-  ized for our own safety and survival. Black  The term "women of  colour" entered the  discourse in the 80s  from the States and was  an attempt to shape a  politic that was inclusive  of all women who  suffered from racism. It  is a term of coalition  more than a term of  identification.  activism goes back in the Toronto community a long time, because we encountered  structures of the State—like the police, immigration—that kept our activism high.  Other communities of colour do not seem to  have had the kind of confrontations that [we  have had] historically with those structures.  That's where our naming comes from.  But the term "Black" is not created in  exclusion of the term "woman of colour" or  other terms. The term "women of colour"  entered the discourse in the 80s from the  States and was an attempt to shape a politic  that was inclusive of all women who suffered from racism. It is a term of coalition  more than a term of identification. When I  say "women of colour," I say women who  are Chinese, South Asian, of African ancestry, PhiUipina, Malaysian, et cetera who share  a commonality of how white power structures deal with us and a need to organize as  women of colour against [those structures].  When First Nations women and Black  women insist upon a specific naming, we  have to respect that. Many First Nations  claims in this country are not settled, we  have 500 years of white people saying "well,  they're not ready," and shit like that.  I understand not wanting to get lost in a  coalition because a coalition is not a home,  it's a room where you come to negotiate all  kinds of things. We come with some  commonality or another, but we come to  struggle and negotiate those things. A coalition is not where you lose your specific  identity. We shouldn't have to in order to  belong to the coalition. That's what colonialism has given us: a debate about identity,  how to identify ourselves, what to name  ourselves because they named us things that  were offensive and they wanted to homogenize—they homogenized all of us into the  oppressed and themselves into the oppressors. But it's a good debate because it means  we'll end up knowing what our politics are.  Charmaine Perkins: When working in  Black women's collectives or women of colour coalitions because of certain  commonalities of, let's say, racism, have you  experienced difficulties negotiating a lesbian identity or politic? What's your experience been?  Brand: Rough! Really rough! It's been  hard for a lot of Black lesbians in Toronto  who've been part of the anti-racist movement who, upon coming out, have faced an  incredible amount of homophobia and isolation. For a lot of us who came out first, who  were active in the movement, and suddenly  had the movement disappear on us, it was  like having family leave.  I certainly felt a sense of loss until I  realized that, maybe it wasn't necessary to  be around the people who did that. And, as  the years went by, [we began] to develop a  notion of Black struggle that was inclusive of  lesbians and gays, to realize that there is no  such thing as an undifferentiated black struggle—there are black conservatives who I  must differentiate myself from too.  And yes, we still get isolated because of  homophobia. Many of us are artists, writers,  painters or musicians—we're supposed to  keep our community alive, to record and  sing it. The sad part about the homophobia  is that a lot of young people won't get to read  us, hear us sing or see us paint because of the  homophobia. Younger people don't have  much of a way out if what they face is  American or Canadian television or the new  Black exploita tion movies from Hollywood.  And then there's us. We get sidelined. At  some point, they've got to find those of us  who, I think, have a broader vision of how  we can move forward.  Perkins: In No Language Is Neutral, the  body and identity is tied to experiences with  land, what you think of as home and making  a home. Then, in your talk at UBC [see box],  you talked about home as never a comfortable place, as nothing you know in the past:  always a "coming to." I was also thinking of  home, as so many of us do—feeling "homeless" or countryless and yes, there is no  going back. You talk about [home as] living  room, working space, whether it's within  your body, and a different sense of identity,  how to even feel comfortable or safe being  you—so [home] is not just a physical space  but a psychic space. Could you expand more  on your work and what home means for  you?  Brand pondering an audience  question  Brand: You are referring to the first poem  in No Language Is Neutral, "Hard Against the  Soul." It's a poem about recognition of a  lesbian sensuality, about how early that recognition was, yet you get taught not to recognize that, so you don't.  Iremember going back to Trinidad about  five or six years ago and seeing something I  had always kept with me, which was the  ocean and the land behind, and suddenly  feeling a real...we were driving up a place  called Maracas and driving across to a place  called Blanchicheuse and...Just the wash of  the ocean and it occurred to me: that's why  "Water more than flour"  by Charmaine Perkins  Dionne Brand, a Toronto-based Black lesbian, feminist activist, writer, poet, filmmaker  and academic, was at the University of British Columbia last month to give the first in the  "President's Lecture Series in Lesbian and Gay Studies."  When academic vice-president and provost, Dan Birch, introduced the lecture series,  urging that lesbians, gays and peoples of colour be recognized for their contributions to the  academic community, he said he believed a Euro-centric, liberal education can be enriched  through cultural diversity, and that "we" are impoverished when we practice exclusion. I  wondered just who this "we" was.  But Brand's presence in this sanctified white-ruling class institution of knowledge and  learning was quite significant for lesbians and straight women of colour. Rarely do we have  the opportunity to be so empowered in this space—one that constantly reminds us "we" do  not belong. Historically, indeed, the university in the West has functioned as a site of  reminder for people of colour of our very "inferiority," through our colonial legacy and our  absence in intellectual proceedings.  Brand's was also an atypical talk as she presented her work in a multi-media format  which included selections from an upcoming novel, a talk, and a clip from her upcoming  film, Long Time Comin'.  Brand explains that, in her writing, she is "trying to find a place to live as a Black woman  and as a Black lesbian woman since in real life, there aren't those places necessarily." In fact,  she says, she often fears for her and other Black womens' bodies in this racist, woman-hating  society.  Brand has published several books of poetry, including her most recent, No Language Is  Neutral, and Sans Souci and other short stories. Other works include Rivers Have Sources Trees  Have Roots: Speaking of Racism, and two of her essays can be found in the recently published  collection of essays Returning the Gaze: Essays on Racism, Feminism, and Politics edited by  Himani Bannerji.  Drawing onher Caribbean upbringing, Dionne frequently recollects certain phrases that  come to her when this language and culture—standardized, technologically- based systems  that lack a highly descriptive and emotive range—fail her.  "Water more than flour," a phrase signifying the dismal state of the pot in the kitchen  and of physical and spiritual realities, formed the centre of her talk. Brand tells us that for her,  this phrase sums up "the condition of being a black woman in the Americas."  "Water more than flour" indicates the tough times or what she refers to as "the thinness  of life's possibilities." Brand argues that, if things are improving, why is it that every public  and private gathering with men, white people, and straights become war zones. She explains  that, for women of colour and women who love women, there is no room to live in our  women's bodies, which are constantly being erased in this sexist, racist, and heterosexist  world. For these reasons, she works towards creating a "Black woman's country." Her  writings are a step towards mapping this as yet undiscovered frontier.   Long Time Comin' will be launched by the National Film Board—Studio D i  this month or early in November.  i Vancouver later  I like women. That I love women because of  their substantiveness—as substantive as the  earth. I don't want to run the risk of getting  ridiculous about "earth mothery" or anything. [Laughter]. I ain't talking about that.  I'm [talking about] learning sensuality  from the curve of the land or the wash of the  ocean. That's what I had recognized—that  that same kind of sensuality was women,  was in women also. What I saw, what I  confirmed there [was] that my lesbian sensuality was somehow fundamental and connected with all the things I had seen and  loved seeing.  But you're not allowed to draw those  conclusions or to draw those two things  together. Yet that's where I feel safe and  comfortable—suddenly owning that language, owning my seeing, owning my eyesight, owning what I see. That for me was  also like owning up to the fact that you see  something that makes you desire and you  acknowledge that desire in ways that you  hadn't been allowed to before.  There's a line in No Language Is Neutral  that talks about the narrator's sister. She's  sitting on a beach drinking a beer. And that  sitting on that beach drinking that beer was  almost a protest to the fact that places like  the night and certain street corners belong to  men. And that they were drinking that beer  as protest against that illegal ownership of  even the night. And that they sat in the  darkness drinking this beer and trying to feel  Safety isn't even in your  room, with each other.  You can't even pretend  that space is safe  because it isn't. There  are ways we have to  figure out about how to  fight for that space, and  those ways are not  individual ways.  AU of my work is looking for that feeling of safety and trying to live in a place  without fear, without fear of men. I think  that's really crucial for women. I don't know  if we can do enough Take Back the Night  marches to fight that. The patriarchy choreo-  graphs where women can show up, where  they can exist, the physical spaces they can  exist in and even the temporal spaces they  can exist in, like evening, night, places getting dark, things like that.  The work is always bound up in trying  to find one's central voice, or one's voice as  a central subject, and also in trying to find  safety, places of safety. I don't know tha t that  will happen unless it happens for all women.  It's like [the American lesbian feminist poet]  Adrienne Rich says: "two women sleeping  together have more than their sleep to defend." And it's true. Safety isn't even in your  room, with each other. You can't even pretend that space is safe because it isn't. There  are ways we have to figure out about how to  fight for that space, and those ways are not  individual ways.

OCTOBER 1993  21 Arts  Review: Snakes and Ladders:  Brooding  and analytic  by Jill Mandrake  SNAKES AND LADDERS  By Kathryn Ann  Impertinent Press, Ottawa, 1993  Kathryn Ann's first collection of stories  is intense, brooding and analytic, like her  protagonists whom we follow through a  series of lesbian relationships—mostof which  are doomed and pensive, but fascinating to  read about nonetheless.  The title-story, "Snakes and Ladders,"  revolves around three nameless women—  two are in a relationship together; the third is  the om inous Ex-lover, whom the two women  meet by chance in the park one evening. Ms.  Ex comes up to the narrator and takes the  lead:  "'Haven't seen you around for awhile,'  she said, thrusting out her hand and shaking  mine with an exaggerated up and down  motion before she inserted her thumbs into  herwaistband and teetered backonher heels,  appraising us with a benevolent grin. 'How's  everyone tonight?'."  It sounds as though she is trying to use  an Oscar Wilde strategy—"Always forgive  your enemies: nothing annoys them so  much"—and is not very good at it. Later, the  Ex sends an ingratiating card to the new  couple, who unfortunately stand on such  shaky ground, this intrusive voice from the  past is too much for them.  In "Relationship in F# Regardless," the  central character Jan has trouble relating to  Yvonne, a woman much younger than she.  For Jan, it's almost like trying to interest  someone hooked on electronic swill and  video glitter in a board game like Snakes and  Ladders. In other words, this pair is divided  by a time warp. It seems if Jan could only  raise her blood sugar level, she and Yvonne  would get along fine. But surprisingly, they  have the singer Marianne Faithfull in common: Jan remembers her as part of the 60s  British "invasion;" Yvonne is familiar with  Faithfull because of her famous 80s comeback:  "[Jan] thought about the bell-like clarity  of Marianne Faithfull's voice during those  early days, and considered what might have  SNMg?LADDERS  happened to her in the intervening years  before the suicidal 'Ballad of Lucy Jordan,'  the choir-girl purity now hoarse and spiced  with cigarette smoke and whiskey fumes."  It dawned on me while reading this,  Marianne Faithfull is a perfect example of  what happened to a lot of 60s women, famous or otherwise. We thought we learned  everything we needed to know in choir practice, but was anyone prepared for the late 60s  licence to self-destruct? If we were addictive  personalities to begin with, we were ill-  fated, like the tone of some of these stories.  We, like Marianne Faithfull and what's left  of her professional voice, are miraculously  still around. An encouraging thought.  The best story in Snakes and Ladders is  probably "Michigan," the long and in-depth  story of an encounter at the Michigan  Womyn's Music Festival. It's written as  though you are there with the character,  trying to put the brakes on a rapidly accelerating romance:  '"You have to learn to take your time,'"  my friend had said, and I reheard her advice  filtering through the raucous cries of the  crows as I beat my way through the ever-  narrowing trail and swatted at the black flies  that travelled in flying formation alongside  my head..."  The story works because such close attention is paid to the external details and the  environment as a whole, you can't help but  . feel involved. If all ten stories had been  i written this way, the collection would leave  you breathless.  Some of the other stories, such as "The  Woman With the Missing Pieces," and to a  lesser extent "Home," offer too much introspection and too little sense of place. At best,  these fragments sound like some of the philosophical digressions in Evelyn Lau's Runaway: Diary of a Street Kid, when we know  Kathryn Ann made it past the runaway stage.  At worst, no one ever buys the film rights to  this type of story (too much talk, not enough  action).  Even considering her most rambling  inner discourse, Kathryn Ann's writing is  obviously re-worked and pared down to a  careful finish. Read her, she's one of our  better new authors.

Whose blood flows in Time  Past-She IS now.  The Invitation is writer Cyndy Baskin's  first novel. Baskin was born in Dalhousie,  New Brunswick and moved to a small Ontario town at the age of six. She is Metis of  Mi-Kmaq and Irish descent.  The Invitation is the story of the friendship of three young women, Karen, Nancy  and Michelle, one Aboriginal, one Metis and  one Anglo-Saxon—grappling with the struggles that derive from growing up in alcoholic families: fear, selfless responsibility,  isolation, unaware self-abuse. Pieces of their  stories are told inalternatingchapters, named  for the woman they are about.  Karen is an Ojibway single mother, left  vulnerable and hurt after growing up knowing how to help everyone but herself. Nancy,  a Metis English student, grew up in a family  whose members rarely expressed emotions.  She is leftfeelingunfulfilled. Michelle spends  her time travelling, never settling, always  running in an attempt to deny and lose her  pain.  The three girls go through school together as the best of friends, listening to  popular music, hanging out, getting drunk.  When their school years are over, each goes  her own way.  Each of the women sees the other two as  living much better lives: for instance, Karen,  bringing up her daughter on her own, feels  a restriction on her freedom. Meanwhile,  Michelle has left the small town, and is  supposedly living a more exciting life and  Nancy is furthering her education, suppos-  Trie  ^w/tatwev  A novel for young adults  edly working towards having a successful  career. All hold on to their memories of each  other, until the day comes when they have  the chance to be together again.  It is refreshing to find a book devoted  entirely to friendship among women, especially friendship based on the tension be  tween disillusionment and acceptance—relationships in which each woman confronts  herself, then begins to move and change.  Karen, Nancy and Michelle invent their own  independencebyrecreating family discourse.  In The Invitation, characters talk and illuminate one another. It is almost impossible to  read about these connections between the  women and their fates without being lured  into theirsearch for awakening. Baskin draws  the connections in an evocative and clear  way, in a way that one can't miss understanding the feelings each woman experiences.  The reader follows the young friends as  they become entangled in their own lives,  almost lost. Yet we understand that one is  always lost when beginning a journey; isn't  knowledge the purpose of travel?  Younger adults may enjoy this book for  a look at addictions through the eyes of  peers. One probably has to let oneself lean  toward the gentle/pain-filled aspects of life  to appreciate it. As one of the Bruce  Springsteen songs the friends listen to puts  Everyone needs a place to rest  Everybody wants to have a home  Don't make no difference what nobody says  Ain't nobody likes to be alone.  o The three young women decipher their  §> own codes and invent new ones with the  TM help of traditional Aboriginal teachings. That  g is the beauty of self exploration and healing.  ° They make us all keep seeking. The outcome  ■° is (unknowingly) created. This quest leads to  £ an answer—a more fulfilled, stronger, more  2 sensitive life of our own.  « In The Invitation, Baskin reveals her  8 knack for writing completely understandable material for youth. Every passage is  clear. I think this book can be very helpful for  a young person beginning to question their  formative years. Baskin's intentions seem to  lean strongly towards creating accessible  writing for younger women who a re or want  to understand more about adult children of  alcoholics.  I finished this book glad I had read it,  thinking that sometimes it's not enough to  know the facts—or maybe too many facts—  but everyone needs stories; inviting someone into one's own story, or placing oneself  into the other's. Isn't that learning?  Tina Arsenault is a young Metis woman and a  first-time writer for Kinesis.

OCTOBER  1993 Arts  Review: A Child is Not a Toy;  Read the children  by Karenza Wall  A CHILD IS NOT A TOY  by Sheila Baxter  New Star Books, 1993  In A Child is Not a Toy, Sheila Baxter  follows the format set out in her earlier  books, No Way to Live and Under the Viaduct—interviews with the people most concerned. As she describes it, "There is no  ending. No literary patterns, no attempts to  entertain."  To me and many, Baxter, whocelebra ted  her 60th birthday last month, is a writer,  worker, feminist, free-thinker, fighter, historian, humanist, humanitarian, activist and  truthsayer. Baxter is a historiogragher in the  court of the poor and chronicler of the stories  of the damned. Baxter is woman; warm.  Truth is stranger than fiction—a cliche.  "Truths sometimes hurt, but burying them  is worse," says Baxter. The truths in A Child  Is Not A Toy are...bone wrenching, gut curdling, blood twisting? The book is an indictment of legalized exploitation and abuse of  children by government, corporations, business in general, the criminal justice system—  all the closed, uncaring, greedy and mean-  minded individuals and state institutions  who, in any way, shape or form, perpetuate  and actively or passively encourage these  systems. Ah, these are words—inadequate  at best. Read the book.  The 12th Annual  VANCOUVER  Read the few pages of statistics. Take  the time to work out the implications. Feel an  arctic chill flow through you and settle.  Read the stories of adults who grew up  in poverty, the commonality of their experiences and feelings.

"When you're full you  can learn better."  -Samantha, 11  Read the child advocates and youth  workers, the social workers and educators  brave enough to speak out; the commonality  of their experiences and feelings.  Read about the lack of food, not just  nutritious food: any food. And its effect on  children: "When you're full you can learn  better," says 11-year-old Samantha.  Read about the lack of proper medical  care. "Death from infectious disease is 2.5  times higher [for the poor]."  Read about the lack of housing. Look at  the drawings. Page 53, page 65. "The poor  people live in boxes"—Julie, child, page 70.  The drawing by Daisy, age ten.  Read about the lack of stimulation and  educational opportunities. The caring, untrained, uneducated cruelty of teachers and  other children.  Walk with Baxter through the pages of  the journal written while she gathered material for the book. Walk and feel with her as  she experiences frustration, sorrow, hopelessness, pain and anger.  "Welfare Mulroney," writes Baxter. "His  money comes from the kitty, from the taxpayer, as does the money for all the other  government services and employees." Yes,  yes, yes!  Use the bookand, as Baxter says, "...pass  it on." Take to heart her ideas, suggestions,  solutions and please: "Please, please, readers of this book, take some action...Get  angry...sadness too often leads to feelings of  hopelessness. Get angry and get active." A  rallying cry!  But most of all, read the children. Read  their pain: "If you're poor, you're sad," says  Tyler, age 13. "Poor is not ha ppy," sa ys Alex,  age five.  Read their sorrow: "Not good to be  poor. Not fun," says Jennifer, aged nine.  Read their depression: "...when you're  poor, you cry and cry," says Annie, aged  four; "At night, I would cry as well, because  I would be hungry for food," says Chris, age  12.  Read their shame: "Being poor is no  money to buy things like your friends have.  Living in poor surroundings, scavenging  through garbage...not much food...not much  fruit. Poor kids feel embarrassed...sad and  frustrated...If you are poor, you can  shoplift...if you have to," says Graham, age  13.  Read why they think they are poor:  "...it's the way the world is," says Paul, age  16; "We are poor because the government  tookall our money, because he is greedy...We  don't have much money to buy clothes, to  get groceries.. .We feel sad," says Robin, age  eight.  Read their solutions: "If I was the boss  of everything, I would make it so that there  was no such thing as money," says Veronica,  age 11; "...let the rich people see how it feels  to be poor. I'd move all the rich people onto  the street, and all the poor people into the  rich houses...," says Patty, age 11; "I'd help  all the poor people if I was a queen," says  Jane, age seven. "If I had money, I would  give some to the poor," says Eileen, age 6.  Read the children: read their suffering,  their abandonment, their anger, fear and  frustration. Read over and over again the  fear, anger, hopelessness, the sorrow and  shame. Read the book and listen to the voices  of the abandoned, exploited, non-recyclable, non-refundable, throw away children.  Karenza Wall is a childcare worker and a  volunteer with End Legislated Poverty.  WOMEN IN FILM  FROM DOWN-UNDER  Bedevil (Australia) "In the air. On the ground. Devil magic  all around." Iracey Moffatf s (Nice Coloured Girls, Night  Cries: A Rural Iragedy) three supernatural stories unfold  against amazingly stylized settings — "hyper-realism  tinged with surrealism" — and utilize a hip, jazzy score.  The Piano (Australia) Jane Campion became the first  woman to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes with this stunning  neo-gothic romance. A mute woman (Holly Hunter, Best  Actress at Cannes), child and piano in tow, travels to New  Zealand in the 1850s to marry a man she's never met. Co-  stars Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel.  Bread and Roses (Newlealand) Gaylene Preston's film  offers many of the fine pleasures found in Jane Campion's An  Angel at My Table. Genevieve Picot (Proof) is Sonja Davies  whose life we follow from pre-WWII through the many  vicissitudes of wartime society and on to political activism. A  compelling, beautifully realized tribute to a generation of New  Zealand women.  Crush (Newlealond) About three women- a Yank femme  fatale, a Kiwi jouralist, and a teenaged girl- and the car crash  that brings them together and forces them into a competition  rife with sexual tension and ironic humour. A unique,  sometimes-shocking film from yet another great Antipodean  woman filmmaker, Alison Maclean.
