Ankur (a new beginning) is an English-  language quarterly about art, literature, social and poUtical issues of concern to the  Indo-Canadian community. As its first editorial says, "Images of the community and  issues that should be of concern to us are  often defined by the mainstream media and  then imposed on us. Having our own journal will facilitate the self-definition of issues..." The Ankur editorial collective, the  majority of whom are women, are particularly concerned with bridging the gap between the generations. Ankur has a strong  women's component: contributors include  Sunera Thobani, Raj Pannu, Surjeet Kalsey  and Yasmin Jiwani. Submissions are welcome from the community. Subscriptions  ($12 for individuals, and $18 for institutions) are available from Ankur, PO Box  67681, Stn. 0, Vancouver BC V5W 3V2.  Red Road is a monthly tabloid by Aboriginal people in Vancouver: "Red Road  [will] fill the communications void created when the government slashed funding  sources for communications to Canada's Indians. Red Road will tell the Indian side of  the story to the world to protect our children, our lands and our sovereignty." Contributors to the first issue include Native  and non-native writers, and a number of  women, including Rosalie Tizya, Jill Bend  and Gunargie O'Sullivan. Red Road may  be obtained by writing to 121B 621 E. 7th  Ave., Vancouver BC V5T 1N9 (tel: (604)  877-0444)  CRIAWs feminist  perspectives  The Canadian Research Institute for the  Advancement of Women (CRIAW) has published a new series of papers and essays  dealing with a variety of women's experiences and concerns. Titles include: Feminist Pedagogy: Teaching and Learning Liberation by Linda Briskin, and The  Trouble with Licensing Midwives by  Jutta Mason.  Feminist Pedagogy examines the gendered character of the classroom, of interactions between students and teachers!  and of the curriculum. It also looks al  contradictions women face as learners anc  educators—especially feminist educators-  and as activists and change makers.  Midwives examines problems associatec  with licensing and the "systemization" o:  midwifery, and asks the question: what does  a shift in the status of midwifery do to  women's power when we birth our children?  Copies of these and other papers in the  series, written by scholars, graduate students and community researchers and activists, can be obtained from CRIAW for  $3.50 plus postage and handling.

The plan is contained in the  task force's report, delivered in  January to Women's Programs  minister   Carol   Gran,   who   es  tablished the body last summer.  Child care advocates are cheering  the report which calls upon the  province to accept responsibility  "to develop, deliver and coordinate an adequately funded, comprehensive, high quality child care  system that is accessible and affordable to British Columbia families."  It's no wonder child care advocates like the report—a good number of them helped write it. The  task force had significant representation from the feminist community including co-chair Penny  Coates, from the Canadian Daycare Advocacy Association; Rita  Chudnovsky, the child advocate  for the city of Vancouver; and  Mary Rowles of the BC Federation  of Labour.  Showing We Care: a child  care strategy for the 90's, the  report's title, challenges the Social  Credit   government—and   Carol  Gran, in particular—to put their  money where their mouths have  not yet been.  The report has close to 50  recommendations, each a building block for a system of publicly  funded, quality "child care options ... [including] full and part  time programs, such as licensed  family day care, group day care  (both community and workplace),  nursery school, parent/child drop-  in programs ... and innovative  programs which respond to the  unique circumstances faced by rural, multicultural, Aboriginal and  special needs children, and parents  with extended or irregular hours of  work or emergency needs."  The task force zeroed in on  staffing issues, in particular the  problems associated with training  and low wages. Training is described as a "standard of care"  issue, and the report calls upon  the Ministry of Advanced Education, Training and Technology to  develop comprehensive early childhood education curricula which reflect and value cultural diversity.  Showing We Care also calls  upon the government to step into  an area of funding the Social  Credit party has long avoided —  direct operating grants. A major  recommendation states that salary  enhancement grants should be introduced to raise staff wages to a  Legal aid strike reveals crisis  by Terry Thompson  The crisis in BC's legal aid system reached a new low in mid-  April when lawyers withdrew their  services from all legal aid cases.  The striking lawyers are pitted  against the BC Attorney General's  office in the first job action of this  kind in province's history.  Caught in the middle are  women, already in crisis from vio  lence or family breakdown.  Organizing the strike is the Legal Aid Action Committee (LAAC)  comprised mainly of Vancouver  lawyers. The lawyers are striking for higher pay and a commitment from the government to adequately fund the legal aid system.  As Kinesis goes to press, talks  between the government and the  lawyers appear to be stalled. The  Legal Services Society, which administers the province's legal aid,  estimates that $40 million more is  needed to adequately fund the system.  The Attorney General's office  is "waiting for the new provincial  budget to see what will be available," says Bob Walsh, ministry  spokesperson. Until that time—  probably mid-May—the situation  will remain deadlocked.  LAAC has pledged to continue  providing emergency legal service  for cases where safety or security is  an issue. While the level of involvement has been left to the discretion of each participating lawyer,  the committee maintains that they  will continue to provide interim  custody/access orders, restraining  orders and freezing orders (the  freezing of disposable assets in a  dispute) until the end of the strike.  For women with on-going cases,  but with settlement or resolution  still not in sight, interim agreements will be set in place before  withdrawal of service.  Tracy Barker from the Battered  Women's Support Services in Vancouver suggests that when women  apply for legal aid during the  strike, they should stress to the  intake workers that the situation  they are in is either dangerous or  in need of emergency measures.  As Kinesis goes to press, no  emergency applications have been  refused.  Finding a lawyer is going to be  tough, but in Barker's experience  it has always been tough.  "I can give a woman [in crisis]  the names of five or six lawyers before she can find someone who is  able to take her case," says Barker.  Then the woman may face a two  to three week delay before actually  seeing the lawyer.  This scenario has gradually developed since the early 1980's and  will likely worsen unless the legal aid fee structure—the amount  lawyers are paid—is changed.  When the rate of pay in a client-  oriented field is extremely low, the  people who fill those positions can  usually be said to fall into three  broad catagories: those who are  at the entry level of their field,  those who are more concerned  with quantity rather than quality  of service (processing as many as  possible with the least effort), and  those who are ideologically dedicated to their work.  Viewed from the perspective of  the woman in need of legal services, this can be devastating.  "Women on family legal aid  can be considered as experimental  since they are usually handled by  inexperienced lawyers," says Jessica Gossen, a member of the action committee and in family practice.  The number of experienced  lawyers (who have practiced five  years or more) choosing to continue to accept legal aid cases  is steadily decreasing—while the  load on them increases. These circumstances have created a second class legal system for poorer  women in the province.  In 1984, the Hughes Task force  on Legal Aid recommended that  the legal aid tariff (lawyer's fee) be  increased to 75 percent of private  rates. Although the tariff has been  raised since that time, it still falls  within the 10—25 percent range  normally charged to a client with  httle money.  As Megan Ellis, a Vancouver  family lawyer points out, the cost  of maintaining an office and staff  is high and "...it's not unusual to  wind up working for less than minimum wage if you are representing  a woman who is involved in a complex custody case, or with a vindictive husband, or who needs language translators."  To a lawyer with two or three  cases going to Family Court in the  same month, the low legal aid tariffs can spell financial disaster.  Besides an increase in tariffs,  the Legal Aid Action Committee  is calling for a restructuring of priorities in the system.  Currently, legal aid is available  for both criminal and family cases,  but the fees paid for criminal legal  aid are substantially higher, both  in preparation and court time.  The fact that the users of criminal legal aid are mainly men while  the users of family legal aid are  mainly women reveals a basic difficulty women have in getting equal  representation in the courts.  The rationale for better service  for criminal cases is that people  face jail terms if convicted.  Says Trisha Joel of the Vancouver Status of Women, "The  fact that women in family law  disputes face violent or vindictive  men, and the loss of their children  or homes—or all of the above—  appears to mean Httle to the planners of this province's legal aid system."  While the current strike is between lawyers and the Attorney  General's ministry, it once again  demonstrates how women are at  the bottom of the heap both in  terms of service and support from  the government.  level which reflects training and responsibility.  Woefully low pay is a major  problem for the child care sector, reflecting the low status of  the work (after all, it's 'women'  work') and the crying need for  public funding. Stated simply, parents cannot afford to foot a day  care bill that includes fair wages  for the people who look after their  kids.  The task force calls upon the  government to take some immediate steps to deal with the crisis in  affordability and access.  Those steps include hefty increases to existing day care subsidy rates (the Socred's only significant ongoing contribution to child  care has been subsidies to eligible parents). For example, 30-35  percent increases are suggested for  parents of children up to three  years old.  As well, the task force was especially concerned with the precarious state of infant and toddler programs (up to age three). The crisis  here is two-fold: very few facilities  exist (there are 45 Hcensed spaces  in Vancouver), and the costs to  parents are exorbitant due to the  high staff-child ratio.  The report calls for the immediate implementation of direct operating grants to these programs,  in order to stabiHze existing spaces  and to encourage the development  of new ones.  Encouraging the development  of new spaces is another priority and the report recommends  a range of capital funding approaches: money to schools, colleges and hospitals to create in-  house facUities; capital funds for  non-profits to buy pre-fabricated  units for emergency needs; annual  direct grants to non-profit group  day care programs and to family (home-based) centres for equipment; and low interest loans to  renovate or repair family day cares  and existing owner-operator centres to meet Hcensing standards.  Showing We Care does more  than urge the government to invest  dollars in child care.  In the long-term, the task force  recommends that the province  work "toward enshrining its child  care mandate and dehvery system  in legislation"—in other words, es-  tabHsh a commitment to child care  as durable as the commitments to  pubHc health care and education.  The report also calls for the  creation of "an authority such as  a board, commission or council  with representative community input ... [with] overall responsibility and accountability and resources" for child care, including  setting provincial priorities. The  body would report to the minister responsible for Women's Programs.  Besides child care advocates,  the task force which produced  Showing We Care had representatives from business (including  a vice-president from forestry giant MacMHlan Bloedel), the Aboriginal community and the "pro-  family" right wing, among others.  see CHILD CARE pg. 4  KINESIS NEWS  Canada's first woman premier:  Johnston: a person of the people  by Joni Miller  Rita Johnston made history when the BC  Social Credit caucus selected her in early  April as the country's first women premier.  Canada's first female first minister.  Is there anything to celebrate?  Rita Johnston came to power through patience, hard work and loyalty to the Social Credit cause. When premier Bill Vander Zalm was forced to resign in his much-  publicized case of conflict of interest, Johnston was there to pick up the pieces. The  member for Newton-Surrey, Johnston most  recently held the Minister of Highways port-  foHo.  Johnston is apparently weU-Hked in Social Credit circles. Despite years of controversy, pubUc pressure and protest from  within the party, she was careful to never  utter a word of criticism against the now  disgraced Vander Zalm.  She is also not known to publicly rock  any Socred boat. Whether the poHcy involved forced employment for single mothers on welfare, funding cuts to women's advocacy groups (in 1984), or low child care  subsidies, Johnston could always be trusted  to be on side.  Now Johnston is busy trying to slap a  new face on the troubled Socred government, before the summer leadership convention (where she is widely expected to run)  and before the faU election (where the Socreds are arguably expected to lose).  In Johnston's first press conference as  premier, she declared that Vander Zalm  was "the past" and she was there to discuss the present. She predicted that the  scandal-marked years from 1986-1991 would  be remembered with pride and that she  was proud of the Social Credit's accompHsh-  ments.  In those early days, she also addressed  the media's questions about the significance of being Canada's first women premier. Various women's organizations had  publicly criticized her record on women's  rights (in one television interview, Johnston responded that she supported "people's rights."). While the Socred party machine seemed bent on exploiting Johnston's  femaleness, Johnston herself said simply  that the government would be paying more  attention to women's concerns, particularly  in the area of violence.  The cabinet shuffle in April produced  the first tangible evidence of that attention.  Women's Programs, headed by Carol Gran,  was elevated to a fuU-fledged ministry under the title Ministry of Women's Programs,  Government Services and Minister Responsible for FamiHes. As Kinesis goes to press,  there are few details about what this expansion wiU mean.  As one of her new duties, Gran has  been charged by Johnston with looking into  provincial funding for a school hot lunch  program. Gran has until June 1st to explore  the idea and wiU be consulting community  programs.  For the past three years, the Socreds  have consistently turned their back on the  widespread problem of child hunger despite  entreaties from school boards, anti-poverty  groups and the general pubUc.  Linda Marcotte of End Legislated Poverty (ELP) is particularly unimpressed by  Johnston's flip-flop on the hunger issue.  ELP members consider the announcement  nothing more than a Socred pre-election  ploy.  "We have no illusions that something will  happen," Marcotte says. "On March 28 we  went to Victoria to visit Norm Jacobsen,  Minister of Social Services and Housing, to  discuss the matter and were told that if any  child is hungry, they should be reported to  his ministry."  The Socreds have traditionally considered child hunger to be the result of neg-  Hgent parents—not poor parents. Now, it  appears, they are prepared to change their  thinking.  Let's Play Johnston's Record  Searching for evidence of Johnston's interest in women—despite her 20 years in  pohtics—yields few results. When Kinesis  raised the matter with Social Credit bureaucrats, they passed it around Hke a hot  potato—from Johnston's constituency office  to Jake Benkin at PubHc Affairs to Ian Jes-  sop, the premier's press secretary. The trail  ended with press secretary Jessop, who declared that Johnston had issued no statements that pertain to women.  Curiously, he made this comment on  the same day Johnston announced the expanded women's ministry.  A search of the Hansard Files—daily  transcripts of proceedings in the Legislative  Assembly—turned up three statements by  Johnston during her legislative career that  mention women.  March 5, 1985: Johnston urged young  women to examine opportunities in scieno?  Cm*>$M  \°AtfnaM\Sl3 tr\»  OJ^yMU^  and technology. She goes on to say: "science has been largely a male preserve—  not by design but by traditional attitudes  which fostered a lack of awareness on the  part of young women. I want to urge all  of the young women in our schools to take  full advantage of these opportunities. Let's  make two-scientist families a part of our  west coast cultural identity."  On March 26, 1987: Johnston said: "A  great deal has been said during the throne  speech debate and budget debate, particularly by members of the opposition, with  regard to the importance of women in this  province, and how for some reason the opposition [the NDP] feel that members on this  side of the House do not take the role of  women seriously  ... it should be pointed out—and this  is a comment I'm making because it applies  most directly to my ministry [Johnston was  Municipal Affairs minister at the time]—  that in the province of British Columbia we  have 22 female mayors, and at every election the percentage of female as compared  to male mayors appears to be growing. It's  certainly an indication of the seriousness of  the entire electorate in selecting the best  candidate for the job regardless of sex."  April 5, 1990: Johnston spoke against an  amendment introduced by Darlene Marzari,  NDP member for Vancouver Point Grey.  She accuses the "sociahst side of the house"  of hypocrisy in regards to women's issues  and says "for the record, on a number of  occasions this government has indicated a  wilHngness to work as best we can to improve the position of women in our province.  "But we should look at what happened  from 1972 to 1975 [during the NDP's brief  stint in power] when there were demands  placed on the government of the day, time  and time again, for some minor recognition  to be given to the importance of women in  the province. Did the government of 1972 to  1975 take any initiative? Absolutely not."  After the Supreme Court struck down the  old abortion law in 1988, Vander Zalm denounced abortion in the legislature and announced plans to cut off provincial funding  to women seeking the operation. When approached by reporters, Johnston, on record  as pro-choice, said she hadn't heard the  speech and couldn't comment.  To be fair, Social Credit governments  have afforded Johnston few opportunities  to vote on legislation designed to improve  n's Hves—they rarely put any forward.  rfL THIS      ISN'T  Tweeds ^    -t-hi?

The  White Rock-Surrey Women's Centre reports years of routinely inviting Johnston to  their events—they are, after aU, in her riding.

"Basically, she has ignored us."  CHILD CARE from pg.3  (Task force members Kathleen Higgins,  president of the Westcoast Women for Family Life, and Charles Lasser, the mayor of  Chetwynd, wrote a minority report which  wholly rejects the philosophy of the main  report. For example, they recommend that  Hcensing no longer be mandatory, and refer  to day care as "substitute care." )  Task force co-chair Penny Coates is understandably pleased with the report. In  particular, she appreciated the shift in  thinking by the business representatives.  "We were able to present day care as a key  economic issue," says Coates, citing the role  of women in the workforce, and the amount  of money circulating through the child care  sector—an estimated $350 milHon annually  in BC alone.  Coates was also pleased with how the Socred initiaUy received the report. "The document was given an incredible amount of  time when we presented it to the cabinet,"  says Coates. "There was a noticeable shift  in how much attention they paid [compared  to previous presentations]. I have to take my  hat off to Carol Gran."  Showing We Care is now being digested  by the five ministries directly concerned  with child care matters: Women's Programs, Social Services and Housing, Health,  the Provincial Secretary, Municipal Affairs  and Advanced Education.  In the meantime, Gran's ministry made  a move on child care with an announcement  of $55.3 milHon in new funds over three  years. (The announcement was made in late  March and promptly got lost in the Vander Zalm shuffle.) Gran also created a Child  Care Team from the affected ministries to  "oversee and speed up the expansion of child  care programs across the province."  According to the ministry, the money—  $12.1 miUion this year —wiU go towards developing a database, researching the impact  of increased subsidies, and "expansion initiatives" such as increased subsidies to parents, low-interest loans to home-based businesses, and streamHning the Hcensing pro-  "I said when I released the task force  report that government would respond  quickly," said Gran when she announced the  money."I'm making good on that commitment."  While welcome news, Gran's money is  not in fact directed towards the urgent recommendations of the task force, such as immediate assistance for infant and toddler  centres. "None of this is necessarily a response to the individual recommendations,"  says the ministry's Dyan Dunsmoor-Farley,  citing the need for thorough and careful  study of the report. "But the government is  responding to the fact that there is a crisis."

The RPC's popularity continues to grow  in the west (there are presently 62,000 members) and with its decision to focus on national pohtics and expand into Ontario,  pohtical observers are convinced that the  party will be a force to reckon with in the  next federal election.  Since the RPC was formed in 1987 by  Preston Manning, (whose father, Ernest  Manning, was the Social Credit premier  of Alberta for 25 years) the party has  been regarded as strongly free enterprise,  anti-Ottawa, right-wing—and racist. At the  Saskatoon convention, Manning went out of  his way to proclaim that bigots were not  welcome in the party, a move designed to  clear up their spotty complexion.  Gordon Shaw, the RPC's recently retired  vice-chairperson, claims that most "radicals" within the party are diehards who  were initiaHy attracted to Manning in the  behef that he would provide a forum for  them to vent their various pohtical frustrations. Now, says Shaw, the party has no  more extremists than the New Democratic  Party, the Liberals or the Conservatives.  And, as Manning has said: "A bright Hght  always attracts a few bugs."  Lynne Brown, co-ordinator of the Port  Coquitlam Women's Centre says that the  RPC should: "put the bright Hght on dim."  Brown beheves there is something distinctive about the Reform Party that attracts  extremists.  Extremist or not, the Reform Party is  distinctly on the right of the pohtical spectrum. Like most parties of the right, the  RPC trumpets a respect for "individual  rights" and a loathing of "big government."  Their pohcies appear on the surface to promote social change, but actually protect the  status quo of women's inequality.  People's, Not Women's Issues  To date, the RPC has no women's caucus,  no explicit pohcy on women's rights and no  apparent desire for gender parity within the  party structure—aU clear signs of danger for  women.  Mary Jane Shaw, a member of the board  of directors for the RPC's Capilano-Howe  Sound constituency, counters such fears by  saying the party is: "not so much interested  in 'women's issues' as 'people's issues'."  Ray Edney, a member of BC's New  Democratic Party Rights Committee, feels  that stressing people's issues over women's  issues clearly signifies that the RPC have  not thought women's problems through  enough.  While the RPC may not have any pohcies supporting women per se, many of their  pohcies directly affect women as a group.  For example, Hke the Conservatives, the  RPC views the cutting of the federal deficit  as a primary target. Their rallying cry for  fiscal reform is famihar enough: "balanced  budget." Their specific strategy to balance  the budget according to their pohcy booklet, is "Resolution One: The federal government shall forthwith enact a law under  which aU future increases in total revenue  must be exceeded by reductions in overall  expenditures until the budget is balanced."  Translated: spend only the money you  take in. Further translated, this approach to  balanced budgeting is invariably at the expense of universal social programs. Not surprisingly, the RPC's first principle of social  reform is opposition to "the view that universal social programs run by bureaucrats  are the best and only way to care for the  poor, the sick, the old and the young."  A national child care program, for example, would never find acceptance with the  RPC. The party, says Shaw, beheves that  under the existing child care system, government money is going to the wrong place,  and should be re-routed directly to families to spend on private child care—whether  that means hiring a sitter, sending the child  to day care or having a parent stay at home.  Just how the money would reach the parents has yet to be clarified, says Shaw. With  items Hke constitutional, parHamentary and  fiscal reform heading the agenda, child care  is "not at the top of the priority Hst."  Diana Hu, the RPC's candidate in the  Vancouver-Quadra riding sees the childcare  problem in terms of divorce: "Divorce right  now is very easy ... couples should consider  reconciliation and learn how to deal with  each other when chUdren are involved."  Couples must find their own chUd care  support system whUe planning a family or  during a divorce, says Hu.  What about a single mother with three  chUdren and no support system? Under the  RPC's approach—essentiaUy a privatized  system—her chUdren would end up in a  centre that barely meets government regulations (if she can afford it in the first  place), whUe wealthier parents would send  their chUdren to a more expensive centre  with aU the friUs. Acknowledging this inevitable problem of two-tiered day care, Hu  said that when it comes to social programs,  "some people always get left at the back of  the bus."  At the Back of the Bus  There is also concern that a lot of people  wUl be left at the back of the bus with  the RPC's platform on health care. At the  Saskatoon conference, the party endorsed  the principle of health care insurance for every Canadian and the right of provinces to  charge user fees for medical services. (User  Do typos turn you into  a raging monster?  There is a vocation for  you - proofreading  Kinesis.  Please call  fees are usuaUy considered to be the death  knell for universaUy accessible health care.)  While their platform sounds contradictory, the RPC denies that it is.  User fees, they say, would be kept to a  minimum and, unhke the American model,  people unable to afford the fees would  not have to pay. The RPC maintains that  Canada must be put back on track fiscally  to maintain our current level of health care.  two different jobs is Hke comparing apples  and oranges and "defies the whole market  system," says Shaw.  "Women have to prove themselves," candidate Diana Hu states and cites her own  profession as an example: sixty percent  of pharmacists are now female in what  used to be a male-dominated profession.  Hu sees many women striving for manage-  ^REFORM  PARTY.  The Vancouver Status of Women's  Trisha Joel predicts a new, expensive bureaucracy would be required to poUce such  a change and is skeptical that it would save  much money. She also beheves this system  would have a huge impact on women, chUdren and the elderly, because it would stigmatize those who cannot pay.  Evidently, such concerns did not influence the female RPC members who participated in the Calgary women's issues seminar in November, 1990. The women were  concerned with "family" violence, however,  and their resolution calling for the enforcement of laws protecting "family members  against such acts and to provide programs  of assistance to both victims and abusers"  was passed at the Saskatoon convention.  (The resolution was titled "FamUy Law.")  VSW's Joel is concerned that the resolution makes no mention of women or chUdren  and her concern is echoed by Port Coquit-  lam's Brown. "The term "family violence,"  says Brown, is a euphemism for men beating  women. I'd Uke a guarantee that the bulk of  the assistance would go to women and chUdren."  Also recommended at the November  women's issues seminar, but not accepted  at the Saskatoon convention was that the  RPC support "pay equity and employment  equity (The implementation of affirmative  action and the use of quotas was not supported)." Many feminists beheve strongly in  the principles of pay equity and recognize  the necessity of quotas and affirmative action for change to occur.  The RPC's Gordon Shaw supports equal  pay for equal work, but not equal pay for  work of equal value—a stance he believes is  common among RPC members. Measuring  rial positions who are "trapped within the  household"—unable to commit to such a job  because of famUy obUgations. She advocates  that "feminism starts at home" with women  resolving their own chUd care before seeking  career advancement.  The RPC does have some strong women's  content. The RPC's only MP is Deborah  Grey of Beaver River, Alberta, and Diane  Ablonczy has just retired as the party's  chairperson. Leader Preston Manning has  called for more women to get involved, but  did this simply reflect his concern that the  smaU numbers of women in the party's  higher echelons would make the RPC seem  too traditional?  According to Brown, the RPC's pohcies  (or lack of them) on women's issues and  its directive towards stronger famUy values  translate into: "Keep the uppity bitches at  home."  The RPC has also done Httle to encourage membership by women of colour and  immigrants. With expHcit anti-multicultur-  alism pohcies, and pohcies on immigration  that clearly favour wealthy people and that  are implicitly racist ("The RPC opposes any  immigration pohcy based on race or creed,  or designed to radicaUy or suddenly alter  the ethnic makeup of Canada"), the RPC  leadership has been understandably concerned about their image.  And it almost goes without saying that  the topic of lesbian and gay rights has never  come up within RPC pohcy-making circles.  The RPC may say they don't support  racism and sexism per se, but the strong reactionary tones in their pohcies have raised  a lot of eyebrows. By aU accounts, the RPC  is on a roU—among other things, right over  KINESIS Losing ground?  Challenge to the "rape shield" law  by Cathy Griffin  In late March, the Supreme Court of  Canada heard the appeal of two men convicted of sexual assault who are seeking  to have the "rape shield" provision in the  Canadian Criminal Code struck down as unconstitutional.  The rape shield law was enacted in 1983  along with other legislative reforms in an  effort to make the criminal justice system  more responsive to the needs of women and  chUdren. The reforms, many of which were  advocated by feminists, were created to encourage women and chUdren to take legal  action in cases of sexual assault and to ensure that sexual assault trials focused on the  behaviour of the accused, rather than on the  victim.  The specific intent of the rape shield legislation was to disaUow evidence relating to  the woman's prior sexual history (legaUy  called chastity) as irrelevant in determining  whether an assault took place. Before the  rape shield law, women in rape trials often  found themselves "on trial" when the defendant's lawyer questioned their past sexual behaviour. For this reason, among others, women were reluctant to report rapes  to the pohce, knowing they would be fur  ther abused by the court system. The rape  shield law excludes evidence relating to a  woman's sexual past, except in some narrow circumstances.  The lawyers arguing against the rape  shield (including Canadian CivU Liberties  Association lawyers) used section 7 of the  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to argue that the accused's inability to look  into the sexual history of the victim infringes upon the accused's right to a fair  hearing. Section 7 of the charter establishes  the right not to be deprived of the principles of fundamental justice.  Arguing in favour of preserving the rape  shield provisions was a coahtion of six or  ganizations, including the Women's Legal  Education and Action Fund (LEAF), and  the Canadian Association of Sexual Assault Centres. Crown attorneys from several  provinces also spoke in support of the law.  The coahtion argued that the rape shield  provisions do not violate the accused's right  to a fair trial. LEAF used an equahty argument: "The emphasis and focus should be  directed to the victim, to ensure her constitutional right to equal protection and benefit of the law. We must protect the women  and chUdren who are the victims. The right  to privacy must be upheld. If it is not, a victim's right to equahty is not respected."  The Supreme Court's decision on the case  is not expected for many months. If the  court finds the rape shield provisions unconstitutional, victims of sexual assault may  once again have their previous sexual history open to examination. Victims of sexual assault would once again endure pre-  1983 conditions when trial judges could allow questioning and admit evidence that  plainly operated to the detriment of the female complainant.  Women's and survivor's groups are angry  at the possibility that this could occur.

M«««M«r«««*»»«  tre in Vancouver, describes the current challenge under the charter as "frightening ...  women's groups have worked hard to restrict questions relating to prior sexual history." In Pilot's opinion, the current system  already perpetuates various myths about  male violence, often placing the blame on  the woman victim and not the aggressor.  WAVAW's Sue McGowan added, "Criminal lawyers are looking for a way to regain lost ground. They have so few defenses  for rapists now that they want to return to  the past, when they could use our own Hves  against us."

Smith  pointed out that the exclusionary rules of  evidence are a common feature of our legal system. For example, evidence of an accused's prior criminal convictions wUl not  be admitted into court because to do so  is considered overwhelmingly prejudicial to  the accused and not in the interests of jus-  ..."they have so few  defenses for rapists  now, they want to  return to the past..."  (SARA), a non-profit society that provides  counselling for adolescent and adult survivors of sexual abuse and incest, described  the charter challenge as an attempt to return: "power to the perpetrator."  There have been other, faUed challenges  to the rape shield, but none have gone to the  Supreme Court under section 7. Christine  Boyle, feminist scholar and law professor at  the University of British Columbia stated  that: "it was only a matter of time untU the  rape shield provision came up against a section 7." In Boyle's view, if the challenge is  successful, it wUl be a powerful example of  the legal system's inability to respond to the  needs of women and other groups requiring  legal protection. As weU, striking down the  rape shield law wUl reinforce the idea that  harm to women and chUdren is not to be  taken seriously.  Lynn Smith, national president of LEAF,  said, "The law isn't perfect, but the rape  tice. According to Smith, the exclusionary  rule should also apply in sexual assault  cases where historicaUy a woman's nonconformity to various rules of "chastity" has  been used against her whUe being of Httle  real value in deciding whether she actually  agreed to sex on the occasion in question.  If the Supreme Court strikes down the  rape shield, Parliament could respond in a  number of ways. Options include enacting  new legislation—essentiaUy, a modified rape  shield law—or promoting the rape shield's  purpose by removing "chastity" as a precondition to a woman's right to personal security and bodUy integrity. Parliament could  also use the "notwithstanding" clause of the  charter to exempt the rape shield from further challenges: however, Smith felt the possibility of this occurring was very unlikely.

New federal strategy:  Will women be aboard this training?  by Shauna Butterwick  • Kim, a 28 year old single mother  living on social assistance with two  years of college, wants to get off welfare  but she has found that most entry level  jobs will not pay a living wage-enough  for child care and other basic needs.  • Betty, 48 years-old and about to  lose her job because the plant she has  worked at for the last 10 years is shutting down and moving to Mexico, needs  to retrain but cannot afford it.  • Jasmine, a trained bookkeeper with  10 years experience, immigrated to  Canada six months ago and cannot find  an employer to hire her because her English needs upgrading and she has no  Canadian experience.  Although their situations are different,  these women need some assistance to enter and re-enter the labour market—and  they're not Hkely to find what they need in  the existing government-funded job training  programs. Women have traditionally been  under-serviced, ignored or shunted into low  paying, "traditional" fields by the government's training strategies. A recent development in this area has the potential to either perpetuate existing problems or to create a system of job training which wUl truly  respond to women's diverse situations.  In January 1991, Employment and Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall  announced the creation of the Canadian Labour Force Development Board  (CLFDB), a new structure which places policy-making in the hands of non-governmental labour market partners. According to  McDougall "... labour, industry and governments at both the federal and provincial  levels have co-operated in an unprecedented  manner to establish a board that serves aU  of our interests."  Whose interests wUl be served is indeed  the central question. For women and other  groups who historicaUy have not had a voice  in government decision-making, this new  non-governmental pohcy-making structure  ...this approach  reduces a complex  social and  political problem  to a purely  economic one...  presents both new opportunities and new  challenges.  The board consists of 22 members: eight  each from business and labour (including  public sector unions), two representatives  from training schools, and one representative from each of the so-called "equity"  groups: women, people of colour, Native  peoples, and people with disabihties. Early  reports indicate that a total of nine of  the current representatives are women. The  mandate of this new board is to identify  labour market needs and design programs  to train Canadians to meet those needs. The  rationale is to ensure that the private sector  plays an active role in decisions about sldUs  training in the country. EquaUy important  is the plan to put into place local and regional structures which wUl also be given  decision-making powers regarding training  needs and expenditures.  Marcy Cohen, a longtime Vancouver feminist and activist who now Hves in Toronto,  has been selected as the women's representative on CLFDB. She was nominated by  22 national women's organizations through  a consultation process organized by the  Canadian Congress for Learning Opportunities for Women (CCLOW). LiUy Stonehouse from Saskatchewan was selected as an  alternate. Cohen is acutely aware of both  the constraints and the possibihties of her  new job.  "With this new board," says Cohen,  "government won't be able to make pohcy  behind closed doors without hearing about  the reality of women's Hves. The challenge  wUl be to organize ourselves autonomously  and to develop our own agenda on training  based on broad consensus." Cohen's experience with previous labour market consultations wUl serve her weU in her new role.  The Human Capital Approach  The creation of the CLFDB is part of a  larger strategy of the Mulroney government  to improve Canada's economic position in a  highly competitive global market. Using a  human capital perspective, the Tories have  focused most of their efforts on training,  viewing it as an investment which produces  higher levels of productivity. Although the  training of workers is a critical factor in economic development, this approach reduces  a complex social and pohtical problem to a  purely economic one (see box). It is also an  approach which ignores the structural inequaUty of the labour market.  in 1985, funds were withdrawn from training schools and routed directly to employer-  sponsored and private-profit training programs.  Under CJS, most women are found in  entry programs where the focus is on ac-  market partners (business, labour, community, educational and "equity" group representatives). The objective of these consultations was to arrive at some degree of consensus about the major program issues facing the government in the upe of the reallocated funds.  J^O    I  quiring minimal skills and job experience  to enter the labour market. Feminists have  criticized these programs because they are  poorly funded, short-term and most of them  have prepared women to enter low-paying  female job ghettos.  The idea for  the recently announced  Supplying workers or addressing needs?  The Canadian Job Strategies and the Labour Force Development Strategy are examples of "supply-side" pohcy where the focus is on supplying the labour market with trained  workers. This approach is individuahstic and blames the victim by locating the labour market's problem in the individual's lack of skiUs or competence. These pohcies do not include  any effort to address the unequal power relations which produce the segregated labour  markets that ignore women's skiUs and devalue women's work.  In contrast, a feminist pohtical economy perspective recognizes that the labour market  is shaped by pohtical processes which are primarily driven by relations of power. A labour  market pohcy informed by such an approach would be both strategic, addressing structural problems, and practical, addressing women's immediate needs such as chUd care, decent traimng aUowances and flexible job training programs. Women have been expected to  adapt to the labour market. Now, it's time to reconstruct the work place so that women's  diverse needs and multiple roles are recognized. As weU, the labour market must change to  both encourage and enable men to do their fair sharing of parenting and household duties.  A feminist approach to labour market pohcy might include the foUowing, to name only  a few:  • pay equity and employment equity programs that not only have tangible, enforceable  results, but actually alter the structure of the workplace  • on-site chUd care in training programs and at work  • flexible job training and work situations (eg. part-time, weekend programs)  • a minimum wage that is a Hving wage  • adequate pay for women's skiUs and talents  • work-based and classroom-based ESL (English as a Second Language) training  • sufficient maternity and paternity leave  • government and business support for unionization of female-dominated occupations  For many years, government and business have argued that community colleges  and technical institutions were not responding to the real needs of the labour market for highly skiUed, technologicaUy competent, flexible workers. As a result, the  government decided that business should be  more directly involved and responsible for  the training of workers. With the introduction of the Canadian Jobs Strategy (CJS)  CLFDB emerged from yet another plan  of the Mulroney government—the Labour  Force Development Strategy (LFDS) initiated in 1989. This strategy was based on  two major changes. First, amendments were  made to the Unemployment Insurance Act  so that, among other changes, recipients  had to work longer and UI monies were re-  aUocated to training. Second, consultations  were held with non-governmental labour  The government asked the Canadian Labour Market Productivity Centre (CLMPC)  to manage the consultations. The CLMPC  is an organization governed by a joint board  with equal representation from the Business  Council on National Issues and the Canadian Labour Congress. The consultations  included two phases. During Phase I, only  three women's representatives out of a total of thirty-nine members participated in  the task forces created to make recommendations about training issues. During Phase  II, where only business and labour were invited to participate, recommendations were  made for the creation of a national training  board, later renamed the Canadian Labour  Force Development Board.  Some parties to the Phase II consultation were actively opposed to equity groups  having representation on the new traimng  board, but the .government argued for their  inclusion: after aU, these four groups together constitute over 60 percent of the  work force in Canada and they weren't going to quietly accept being shut out.  Marginalized  This past December and January, in response to concerns about the marginalization of women within the LFDS consultations and the opportunity to have a voice  on the national board, CCLOW organized  meetings with 22 national women's groups  concerned with education and training, including business, Native, women of colour,  and disabled women's organizations. The  purpose of the meetings was to determine a  consensus model for selecting the representative and to develop principles of fairness  and equity regarding CLFDB activities.  Three principles were developed. First,  equity must be a consideration for aU parts  of the LFDS. Equal gender representation  and a full reflection of the diversity of our  society must be central considerations in  the creation of aU national and regiona  structures. Second, monies must be made  avaUable so that equity representatives are  able to communicate with their constituencies and for the required research and other  consultative mechanisms. Third, structures  See TRAINING page 8  kinesis  ~   ; NEWS  Childhood sexual abuse:  Jumping the court's hurdles  by Beverley Stewart  "Taking your offender to court is such  an isolating experience. You have to defend  yourself—it's Hke being on trial yourself."  These words were spoken by Paula (not  her real name), the founder of a new Vancouver support group for women survivors  of chUd sexual abuse. Paula experienced  "being on trial" during her father's court  case. He sexuaUy abused her as a chUd (she's  in her mid-20's now) and whUe the Crown  saw fit to prosecute the case, the judge  found him not guilty because of "reasonable  doubt."  Like most sexuaUy abused chUdren,  Paula was the only witness—outside her  father—to the crime.  So she puUed together the support group  as a means of combatting the sense of alone-  ness that many survivors experience. Learning from and supporting each other are  the goals shared by the half dozen or so  women who meet informaUy once or twice a  month to talk over their thoughts and feelings about making a pohce statement and  undergoing a trial.  The results of their group discussions  have been wonderful. New friendships have  formed. Names of good lawyers and counseUors have been exchanged. Women have  gained increased confidence when approaching trial—and renewed determination. In  short, many giant steps have been taken on  the road to the healing and empowerment  aU victims of chUd sexual abuse seek.  "No one else had told me what it's Hke  to be cross-examined in court," says Paula.  Because of the insights gained from women  in the group, she was able to remain calm  during the gruelhng cross-examination.  Paula's criminal case was heard by a  judge (the defendant can opt for a trial by  judge or jury), and she considers the judge's  ignorance of abuse issues as one reason for  the not guUty verdict. "Judges are removed  from the 'real world' and tend to foUow the  letter of the law," says Paula. "Juries are  more Hkely to be moved by a victim's testimony."  Now, Paula is pursuing a civU suit against  her abuser father.  Enormous Obstacles  The obstacles facing a woman wishing to  take her abuser to court, either on criminal charges or under a civU suit, are enormous. WhUe criminal action can be initiated at any time, criminal courts require a  rigid standard of evidence that makes Uttle  sense in the context of chUd sexual abuse.  As weU, women must be prepared to face a  judicial system that cries out for sensitization to the issues—especiaUy among judges.  CivU suits—suing the abuser for damages—pose different obstacles. The Limitations Act, provincial legislation limiting the  initiation of civU legal action to a period two  years from the time of the assault or two  years from the victim's nineteenth birthday,  stands in the way of a successful civU suit  for many. ChaUenges based on the discrim-  time restrictions on sexual abuse suits. The  advisory groups stated that any deadhnes:  "reward assailants who have most effectively traumatized and sUenced their victims."  Enormous though the hurdle posed by  the Limitations Act may be, the intensely  personal barriers to action that women face  are no less great. First and foremost among  these is the feehng of isolation the whole legal process engenders.  Because a woman is often the sole witness  to the crime, the burden of proof rests entirely on her shoulders—a burden that she  wUl Hkely feel from the time she first makes  a pohce statement to the end of her long  journey through the court system. Add to  this the fact that other farmly members often deny, avoid or simply cannot accept her  abuse and the woman's sense of a'  may be truly overwhelming.  "No one else had told me what it's like  to be cross-examined in court," says Paula  inatory nature of the act are increasing, fu-  ehng hopes for its reinterpretation.  Paula's case represents such a chaUenge.  And she is not alone.  Several other cases, including Judy's (another support group member), will challenge the BC Limitations Act in 1991.  As weU, some Crown prosecutors, notably  Wendy Harvey of Vancouver, beUeve the  law must be changed to reflect the reality  that many women (and men) do not "remember" their abuse untU they are weU into  adulthood.  An advisory group in Ontario recently  recommended to the Attorney-General that  Ontario's law be amended to eliminate any  TRAINING from page 7  must be put in place that would provide coordinating assistance to the women's representative, and for smooth and effective communication from community level organizations to the board.  Since those consultations, a reference  committee has been established consisting of representatives from the 22 national  women's organizations and representatives  from community-based training coahtions,  [including the Women's Employment and  Training Coalition (WETC) here in Vancouver. The mandate of the reference committee, which wiU meet in Toronto in AprU,  is to develop communication strategies to  support the women's representative and to  begin to put into place opportunities for  women's groups across Canada to create a  women's agenda on training.  Women also face barriers due to shrinking resources and increasing demand. The  Tories' recent budget cut $100 miUion from  CJS funding. Monies for traimng which  were to be reallocated from UI funds have  not materialized because of the recession  and high levels of unemployment. Given  shrinking funds and increasing demands,  there is great risk of a divide and conquer  situation as different sectors struggle to  place their interpretation of training needs  and funding priorities on the table.  There is also great potential to blame the  victim, to locate the source of troubles with  unemployed workers and people on welfare.  Although these people were identified as.  most in need of programs to be developed  from the reallocated funds, in reality, fewer  resources are now avaUable to serve them.  Further tensions between employers, workers and those who were to receive the benefits of new programs are also Hkely as UI  premiums are increased to deal with the removal of federal UI contributions.  If we are to see the changes to labour  market pohcy and job training that wUl  meet the needs of women, we must take this  opportunity to define, for ourselves, what  our interests and needs are. As Marcy Cohen states, women must be included and  must change the process. "Links are being made with other representatives on the  new CLFDB," says Cohen. "We are becoming an organized constituency which can no  longer be ignored. We must take the opportunity to ensure that women's multiple  needs are heard, that women not only participate, but contribute to a democratization of the pohcy-making process."  Shauna Butterwick is the BC representative on the national board of  CCLOW and, as an active member of  WETC, will be representing the coalition on the Reference Committee.  The necessity of reliving memories of sexual assault when making a pohce statement  and when testifying in court can leave a  woman feehng re-victimized. For some, the  desire to put the whole experience behind  can override other concerns.  This is where the support group comes  in. No longer need she feel aU alone, helpless, a victim. By meeting with the support  group, Judy learned that you don't have to  be alone when talking to the pohce or when  in court. "Bringing a friend along makes it  much easier. A friend or spouse wiU stand  up for your rights if you get confused and  forget them," Judy says.  Another thing Judy wasn't aware of was  her right to speak to a female officer when  making a pohce statement. "It's much easier to describe the circumstances and details of your abuse to another woman,"  she says. Judy's' seven-year-old daughter  has also been sexuaUy abused and wouldn't  make a disclosure to the pohce untU a female officer was brought in.  Paula, on the other hand, preferred talking to a male officer because, as she claims,  "men need to be impressed with the horror  of the crime."  The group recognizes that going public—  going to court with a charge of chUd sexual  assault—may not result in a conviction, yet  women's reasons for pursuing a charge are  valid regardless of the result.  TeUing their story, whether or not it  yields a conviction, is for some women an  integral part of her healing process. The  telling enables them to gain control over  their Hves and forces others, in particular  their offender, to Hsten.  "Being in court is empowering," says  Paula. "The chUd who was wronged is now  being heard."  According to CoUeen Smith of Women A-  gainst Violence Against Women (WAVAW)  Rape Crisis Centre, because the Hkehhood  of success in court is smaU, the act of speaking out must be the woman's main objective and reward. In this way, her heahng is  within her own control.  For The Children  When Paula takes her father to court this  faU, she wUl have to prove that the abuse  "probably" happened (civU courts require a  more relaxed standard of proof than criminal courts), that she was "damaged" by the  abuse, and that there was a breach of trust  by her father. And she wUl have to successfully chaUenge the Limitations Act. Paula  is suing to pay for the time she has been  unable to work due to her healing, as weU  as therapy expenses. She can afford to go  to court because her lawyer, a femimst, has  accepted the case on contingency.  For Paula, this enormous effort is for  more than just herself: "The more places  I can be another statistic," she says, "the  more good it wUl do. Society needs to hear  this."  As more criminal and civU cases are won,  more women wUl be encouraged to go public  with their stories. And not just women, but  men and abused chUdren have been adding  their voices to the story. The historical effect of public disclosure wUl be a gradual  turning of the tide of sexual abuse of chUdren. "We must do this to protect future  chUdren," says Paula,  Any woman survivor of incest wishing to contact this support group is encouraged to call (604) 530-8265.

The team had come a long way. Dubbed  the underdog of the league aU season, the  Bladerunners beat the odds as a first-year  team by winning the BC league in the Senior AAA Female Ice Hockey division, the  highest division of women's ice hockey in  Canada.  The Bladerunners came one game away  from winning the BC provincial championships—provincial champs go on to compete in the national championships which  are the Stanley Cup equivalent in Canadian  women's ice hockey. Second place provincial winners compete at the Canadian Western Shield with teams from BC, Alberta,  Saskatchewan and Manitoba. This year BC  won, and more specificaUy, the underdog  Vancouver team won.  In a round robin competition, the  Bladerunners lost their first game against  Alberta and tied their second game against  Manitoba, leaving their fate in the hands of  Manitoba's Lady Bisons—a win or tie for  Alberta would have left BC competing for  the third or fourth position. Manitoba won,  bumping Vancouver into second place position.  The rest is herstory. Vancouver's goahe,  Bev Goldstone, shut out Manitoba's star  Judy Yuan, who played on Canada's All-  Star World Champions team for women in  1990. An open-net third period goal by  Bladerunners' Kathy Fasenko topped the  two first period goals, bringing the score to  its final 3-0 victory.  There are three divisions of women's ice  hockey in Canada: senior AAA, senior AA  (known as B leagues in other provinces) and  the midget (17 and under) division. The Senior AAA division is the elite of women's  ice hockey in this country, but it struggles  to get the recognition and sponsorships that  its male counterparts have—even on an amateur level. In essence, triple A struggles to  A lot is needed to put together a team  and keep it together. Teams need players, coaches, managers, practice and training time—and the money to pay for these  things. Although a first year team, the Vancouver Bladerunners had some individual  players who were veterans. StUl, this was  the first year these women had ever played  together as this team.  The vision came from players Sorres  Doyle and Leshe Hope who saw a need to  create another team and broaden the competition at the Senior AAA level in Vancouver. They buUt the team from the ground  up after connecting with other women during the Lesbian and Gay Games held last  summer. The Games had a mixed-gender  ice hockey competition in which one of Vancouver's teams, the Real Puckers, won the  bronze. The women sought and received  approval from the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA) and the  Lower Mainland Female Ice Hockey Association who control the women's division of  the BCAHA.  The  Bladerunners'     f |  Division A  Championship  pennant  Being approved for league play was the  least of their worries.  And they didn't have much trouble finding talented and dedicated players, and  they didn't lack in enthusiasm. Coaching,  however, proved a more complex area—the  team lost all its assistant coaches for various personal reasons.  This left the Bladerunners with only a  head coach, Lynncy PoweU, who was also  a valuable and needed player on the team.  Quality women coaches are hard to find under the best of circumstances: most are either stiU active players or already coaching.  It is difficult to coach a team from the ice,  and it's essential to have a coach or assistant coach behind the bench at aU times.  The Bladerunners worked with what they  had and ended up doing weU overall.  Another problem the Bladerunners faced  is a problem shared by women's ice hockey  on aU levels. Hockey is expensive: the cost  of equipment, ice time and quality coaching  (when avaUable) is not easily met by individual players. Winning the provincials and  going on to the national championships—  usuaUy held somewhere back east—doesn't  Sports:  Meanwhile, back in the caboose  by Marjorie Blackwood  Since the release of the Women in Sport  pohcy by Sport Canada four years ago, very  Httle has changed in terms of female representation at the decision-making levels of  sport in this country. In fact, a 1990 national study by professor Anne HaU at the  University of Alberta shows that women's  representation in the upper levels of sport  is, unfortunately, a non-issue.  HaU's 1990 report also makes evident  that increasing numbers of women are in  entry level positions (comprising almost 70  percent of some jobs), yet very few women  hold senior executive positions. Although  the number of women in these executive  positions has risen over the past decade, a  disturbing correlation is at work here. Simply put, the higher the sport organization's  budget, the fewer women hold executive  positions; and the lower the organization's  budget, the more women hold executive positions. Women are riding in the caboose of  the ports budgetary train, but working just  as hard as the guys in first class.  Here is one revealing gender/salary  statistic from HaU's study:  • 43 men in senior executive positions  • 15 women in senior executive positions  • 15 men earned $50,000 plus per year  • 0 women earned $50,000 plus per year  If, as HaU's study suggests, women's representation in the executive positions of  sport is seen as a non-issue, what will happen to the numbers of women in junior positions who have their noses firmly pressed  against the "glass ceiling?" Are they destined to fiU up the base of the pyramid  or wUl opportunities be made avaUable for  them to rise through the system?  Marion Lay, the coordinator of Sport BC  women's organization, Promotion Plus, is  working to create opportunities for women  to rise through the system. Since the issue  of inequity in the sport workplace is both  denied and invisible, the first step is to educate the various sport organizations that  this is a valid issue, says Lay. After they are  convinced, each sport must have a plan to  target and recruit women for senior management positions.  Once the National Sport Organizations  (NS0) have decided to implement equity  pohcies it wUl be crucial to monitor their  progress from both within and outside  the organization. Lay suggests that Sport  Canada could implement an incentive system for organizations by sanctioning them  based on their implementation of target  goals for women in management positions.  The goal would be for 50 percent represen  tation within the culture of the sport. Further incentives would be to provide subsidies for NSO's with women in training, or  annual funding to be based upon the implementation of equity pohcies.  Another problem faced by administrators  Hke Lay is that funding for women's programs is constantly perceived as stealing  money away from athletes and other programs, most of which are already struggHng  to make ends meet. The proper establishment of women's equity programs means a  commitment of more funds from the provincial and federal governments, not ruining  present programs by taking money away  from them.  Another critical goal of equity programs  would be for women to receive a "quality" experience (read: not isolated) along  the way to becoming senior executives, and  the maintenance of that positive experience once they get there. Instead of women  changing to fit into a male-dominated organization, the workplace must change to accomodate both women and men.  Anne HaU's study shows both the need  for an equal opportunity pohcy, and a  method of monitoring and enforcing that  pohcy. It wUl be Sport Canada's job to  set the guidelines and open the doors for  women's equity in the workplace of sport.  look as glamorous when you're facing an additional cost of $5,000-$10,000 for traveUng  expenses as a team of fifteen.  Younger women and girls interested in  developing their skiUs in the sport of  women's ice hockey are stiU often overlooked. The midget division is too broad  and leaves players of 16 and 17 years of age  (and years of experience) playing with or  against players half their size and sometimes  less than half their sMU.  There is no current program that affiliates midget teams with a senior division  counterpart as a way of facUitating the transition between junior and senior ice hockey.  Young women entering the senior divisions  have talent but lack direction or experience  in senior AAA competition levels. They often don't make it in try-outs and sometimes  get stuck in the AA or B division indefinitely.  . The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), whUe graduaUy recognizing  the needs of women's ice hockey, is taking  its time in meeting those needs. In 1990, the  first-ever World Ice Hockey Championships  for Women were hosted in Ontario. Canada  skated away with the gold. BC had no representation on this aU-star team. BC has traditionally lagged behind other provinces in  the development of women's ice hockey. The  BCAHA is working to provide the necessary  elements to promote women's ice hockey  but, for the most part, the players' incentive keeps the sport alive.  Fortunately their incentive is strong  enough to keep them skating. National  championships were held in Montreal this  year, and BC's midget team won sUver  medals after defeating Ontario. The Surrey  Flyers, BC's Senior AAA representatives at  the Nationals, took 5th place.  FinanciaUy, however, a lot of women are  left behind. Sponsorship (by groups or individuals) of specific teams or divisions is  one solution and always helps, but sponsorships come from the efforts of a manager  or team member wUHng to solicit the support. Sponsorship for women's hockey needs  to be taken seriously—which means that  the governing associations need to invest  time and energy into this work. Only then  wUl women's ice hockey progressively grow  throughout the province and Canada—and  only then wUl women's ice hockey get the  recognition it so richly deserves.  Hockey is Canada's national sport yet  only half the population gets support to  play. As in almost every other field, women  have proven their dedication to and talent  in hockey. We deserve not only recognition  and acknowledgement, but sponsorship and  publicity so that we can excel wherever we  want to excel: in this case, on the ice.

KINESIS Literacy in South Africa:  Critical thinking is a crucial    goal  by Connie Shuster  Earlier this year in South Africa,  Louie Ettling interviewed Connie Shuster. an organizer with the literacy  organization USWE. The main aim  of USWE—"Use, Speak, Write English"—is "to help adults with little or no  formal schooling acquire the skills and  knowledge they need to play an active  part in the process of social and political change ...  "  USWE sees the 1990's as a particularly challenging era for literacy  workers—and sees the challenge politically. According to their literature, "Literacy is ... linked to the building of  a lasting democracy. What we have to  guard against is a Hop-down' as opposed  to 'bottom-up' approach. Any attempts  at mass literacy provision must be effective, realistic, relevant and community-  controlled. If not, we face the danger  of literacy being seized upon as means  of domestication rather than empowerment. "  "As part of the progressive National  Literacy Network, USWE is campaigning for the adoption of an empowering  functionaUy UUterate, in both rural and u  ban areas. Up untU now, attempts to solve  or aUeviate the problem have been tiny  drops in the ocean: organizations such as  ours, which are relatively smaU-scale, can't  deal with more than at the most 500 learners because of staff shortages and funding  shortages.  Large scale structures are desperately  needed and that is finally what is happening now. There is basically a two pronged  change. One, there is a lot more cooperation between the different organizations. In the past, there was a tremendous amount of rivalry, pohtical disagreement, and methodological disagreement. In  the last two or three years, in the four different provinces of South Africa, literacy cooperatives have been set up. They have a  tentative national Hnk which is not particularly active at the moment, but it's been established to actually [create] a channel for  communication. There are now exchanges of  Hteracy work and materials, expertise, and  training structures.  That's one side: a lot more co-operation.  The other side is that finally major internal  funding has become avaUable. That is basically due to a shift in the pohtical direction.  The Independent Development Trust has  approach which is skills-based, which  integrates literacy and language skills  within a broad educational curriculum,  which develops skills for life-long learning, and encourages critical thinking—  rather than the passive acceptance of information fed from above."  USWE teaches "English literacy and  oral communica tion skills; mother tongue literacy skills (Xhosa and Afrikaans); numeracy and other access  skills; critical thinking and self-confidence; group negotiation, decision-making and other skills needed to participate in democratic processes; and under standing the socioeconomic causes  of exploitation and oppres sion and  considering strategies for overcoming  them."  Connie Shuster is a white South  African who has worked with USWE  since 1986 as a teacher and organizer. Louie Ettling, also a white South  African, started the interview by asking  her about the scope of the literacy problem.  Connie Shuster: The government has  said that 50 percent of Black adults in South  Africa are functionaUy UUterate. But the reality, as shown by independent surveys by  universities, is that 65 percent of adults are  been established that has been essentiaUy—  if I can put it so bluntly—okayed by the  ANC. Non-governmental organizations such  as ours have essentiaUy decided to make use  of those kind of funds.  The formalization of Hteracy [programs  and strategies]: that's what's needed desperately. First, we have to formalize training so that Hteracy teachers have acceptable diplomas. We need certificates that are  generaUy recognized, for learners especiaUy:  once they've gone through two or three  years of basic education, they should receive  a certificate that enables them to move on  to further schoohng or vocational/technical  training.  USWE started on a smaU, informal scale.  In 1981, the founder of USWE, M.B. Ledo-  chowski, was approached by domestic workers in Johannesburg, who were desperate  to learn Enghsh. They were mostly Zulu  speakers and because of their lack of skiUs  in very basic things Uke taking messages,  writing down recipes, going to the Post  Office, fiUing out forms, they were jeopardized in terms of the choice of better  employment. They approached her because  she had already established another organization called "Learn and Teach" and  they asked her to do something about the  problem—there was no structure that could  absorb them.  She set up so-called "centres of concerns"  which were based in churches in Johannesburg where teachers would run smaU  groups, mostly attended by domestic workers. Because of their success and the desperate need, those groups grew rapidly. In  response to requests by learners, USWE  very desirable teachers to have because of  their Xhosa speaking skiUs, community involvement and similar background to the  learners. This has proven to be very successful. We are able to provide employment at  [only] a very basic salary as weU as further  training for the teachers. Through USWE,  they have been able to attend university  courses despite the apparent lack of qualifications.  "The reality...is that 65 percent of  adults are functionally illiterate...  expanded into the general basic education  area.  Up untU two years ago the core of our  methodology was based on learners' needs.  Each group basicaUy had a different syllabus [spelling] and a different course designed by their teacher. The group was supported by resources from the organization  and expertise of staff, but they were largely  structured approaches using codes—very  much homed in on the individual groups'  needs.  We started realizing how problematic  that approach was, primarUy because learners quite rightly demanded that their Hteracy training should be structured around a  logical continuum to further education, to  proper qualification. Otherwise, they were  sacrificing valuable hours after work [for  traimng that] didn't really lead anywhere.  The whole concept of becoming Hterate  and therefore getting a better job actually  was a misnomer—it didn't always correlate with what we were doing. In fact there  were ironic situations of our learners moving off into very conservative organizations  because they were much more structured  and offered a certificate. Slowly but surely  we took notice of these urgent requests and  started structuring our courses more.  The individual learner's and groups'  needs are stUl taken into account, but now  a general syllabus structure has been established ...  In conjunction with the general expansion of the organization, we began to be approached by unions to run the classes for  their members. We were approached by general companies to run classes for their employees which we then did through communication with the appropriate unions. So  the groups became larger ... and a lot  of [learning] venues were established in the  "...if money for  education is cut,  that is a direct  line to disaster."  townships themselves. That development  brought about a much greater interest and  focus on Hteracy. More educated individuals  would approach the organization requesting to teach. We then established a formal  training course.  OriginaUy, [our instructors were] middle-  class white teachers who volunteered to  teach in the evenings after their day's work.  Now, a lot of unemployed Black teachers  with an approximate Standard 8 education  [equivalent to Grade 10] are drawn into our  traimng programs. And they were obviously  PohticaUy, USWE has always held a non-  ahgned status, for the very simple and clear  reason that our learners come from a variety of pohtical backgrounds. To ahgn with  a particular organization, we would auto-  maticaUy exclude a certain number of learners and teachers. We beheve that we are  a service organization and should not be  aligned with a particular pohtical group.  Obviously we have been part of the broad  anti-apartheid movement and we have not  in any way co-operated with the apartheid  government.  Louie Ettling: I'll throw a contentious  issue at you. I've heard people saying—  Homelessness:  by Josette Cole  Louie Ettling also interviewed Josette  Cole, a white organizer with the Surplus  People Project. Established in 1979 as  a research body, the SPP now plays an  activist role around issues related to the  forced removal and evictions of Black  communities from their land.  The South African government has  recently moved to eliminate certain aspects of legal apartheid, notably in the  area of land ownership. As the SPP and  the African National Congress have observed, the legal right to "own land"  means less than nothing to the Black  people of South Africa who have been  systematically forced from their territories and forced on to barren, undesirable lands.  For example, the SPP estimates that  in Natal province alone, 105,000 people were forcibly relocated between 1948  and 1982. Many of those people seek to  return home. Under the South African  government's "relaxation" of the laws  of apartheid, there are no provisions for  their return.  Louie Ettling: I know that statistics  often don't give an accurate picture, but  what are the statistics at the moment  around homelessness in the country?  Josette Cole: The figure is about 17 milHon homeless people. It depends on how you  when they look at the overwhelming  needs of the country and how they will  have to cut down on basic need—"drop  adult education, it's going to be too  costly. Let's focus on the children, on  what's going on in the schools right  now." What would your reaction be to  that?  Connie: I would also emphasize that yes,  of course, chUdren's education is the most  important area and should start in year  zero; that good creches [daycares] should be  established, that good support structures be  established—not oidy in education, but in  health and housing ...  But a lot of the ground work [for adult education] has been done, a lot of experience  has been collected and collated. With major  funding, significant change can be achieved  in the next three years. That would effect  a large number of adults, who would then  be able to go into technical and vocational  training or further schoohng. That is vitally  important. As any developing country has  shown, if money for education is cut, that  is a direct Hne to disaster.  We are talking of adults from 18 years onwards. There are miUions of them and they  wUl hve in this country for at least another  50 years and it wUl be disastrous to just let  them be. It would be disastrous to the economy, it would be disastrous to the individuals and it would be disastrous to the country in general.  Thanks to Terry Thompson for tran-  scribing the tape.   'Free    market" approach ignores reality  , KINESIS  define homelessness. Obviously the townships are aU over-crowded and a huge percentage of the Black population is struggling around the issue of housing or shelter  at one level or another. From our perspective, it's one of the major issues of the day.  The White Paper announced by President de Klerk in March is the government's  land reform program. It calls for abolishment of the Land Acts and the Group Areas  Act and related legislation. The Black Communities Development Act wUl deal with rural development and the establishment of  informal settlement areas. The act is portrayed in a way that gets away from racist  discrimination so that everyone is "equalized." Now we can aU have an "equal opportunity" to acquire land and property.  The major fault of the program is that  it says, "okay, let's all start from scratch.  It's 1991 and here we are. Let's get away  from legislation and let's aU go out into the  free market and find our way." This approach refuses to acknowledge that for 30-  odd years, we have sociaUy engineered people out of the capacity to either acquire land  or housing. That's the major problem [with  the land reform] arid the African National  Congress has condemned it and our national  structure has condemned it. [The ANC has  said the reforms would "codify the current  state of the dispossessed under the cover of  free market principles."]  On top of that problem, the reforms wUl  radicaUy restructure relations both in the  urban areas and in the countryside. They  haven't just gotten rid of racist legislation:  they're actuaUy intensifying class divisions  in the urban and rural areas. The reforms  [represent] a major break with the past and  they were announced prior to negotiations  [with Black organizations], and prior to constitutional talks. We've seen how struggles  unfold within these regions concerning [land  ownership], and these reforms are going to  radicaUy change the balance of power in relation to property rights. The government is  talking about coming up with housing programs. Yet nothing is speUed out in any detail.  Louie: Tell me something about the  Surplus People Project and about some  of your more recent successes ?  Josette: The Surplus People Project is  a service organization in formal existence  since 1986. We mainly work with Black  communities struggling with land and housing issues, in both urban and rural areas.  In the rural areas we work predominately  up the west coast in Namaqualand [on the  Cape] and, in the urban areas around 50 to  60 kUometers around Cape Town.  Our national structure consists of five regional affiHates in Natal, Transvaal, Eastern  Cape, Southern Cape and here in the Western Cape. And there are new groups emerging in the Transkei and the Free State.  Since De Klerk's March announcement,  there have been struggles between private land-owners and Black communities.  In some cases, the state has actually intervened on the side of the communities—  become the arbitrator between the private  sector and the communities. This is a very  bizarre, strange new role for the state to  play.  In Hout Bay and in Noordhoek [two communities near Cape Town where the Surplus People Project is very active], the central state, through the House of Assembly,  actually played a key role in trying to defuse  the situations. In December, houses were  burnt out in Hout Bay, over 100 houses in  one of the five communities there. This fire  sped up the necessity to find a solution. The  "...they're actually  intensifying class  divisions in the  urban and rural areas."  state has identified land for the communities. They've bought it and are now trying  to upgrade it, and they have sped up the  movement of people [onto the land]. The  first two groups they moved were from private land.  There are obviously lots of problems  on the ground—people finding their way  around and sorting out social dynamics.  The new area is not as close to town as the  people were before—they are quite cut off.  They are very much up against the wall in  terms of what to do in this situation, with  the private land-owners having very many  rules and laws to their advantage. Before,  they had lost an eviction case which the  land-owner had brought against the community —it's very difficult to win a private  law case Hke that. So the community didn't  feel they had many alternatives when the  state offered this land, which is not a bad  piece of land. But that's just the beginning  of the struggle.  As for the reaction of the white community, it's been a combination of racist and  class issues. My sense has been that the  Hout Bays and Noordhoeks signal the reality of the struggles about land in this country. They are microcosms. So what we see  here is a test of pubUc opinion in general for  the white community.  Louie: Is it still the case that the Surplus People Project is very much run by  women, and how does that compare with  many of the other projects around?  Josette: That's stiU strikingly [true]. We  had a national meeting with an affihate that  had mainly women on staff. It's not really  through choice, it wasn't that we said we  only want women. Women have been the  best in terms of commitment and staying  power. Our work is very tough. On the one  hand, the men who are young Black activists have lots of other involvements. Secondly, there are some strong women on the  project and it's quite hard for a man to  make it in the Surplus People Project.  KINESIS RU 486—"The abortion pill:  s  tops, starts and uncertainties  by Heidi Walsh  If you're involved in the pharmaceutical industry, you'd probably call it a miracle drug or a revolutionary breakthrough.  It's been haded as a potential cure for anything from breast cancer to AIDS. Its official name is RU 486, but most of us know  it simply as "the abortion pUl".  Around the world 60,000 women have  taken RU 486 as a chemical alternative to  surgical abortion, but not one of these abortions has taken place in Canada. Nor are  they ever Hkely to, unless the French manufacturer of the drug can be convinced that  Canadian public opinion accepts a woman's  right to terminate a pregnancy.  Many feminist health activists are ambivalent about the use of RU 486. On  the one hand, they welcome a safe, nonsurgical approach to abortion and feel the  drug could increase the privacy of women  who are too often harassed by anti-choice  zealots. On the other hand, they are wary  of RU 486, conscious that women are once  again being given drugs which alter their  body chemistry and whose long-term effects  are unknown—and could prove to be disastrous.  BasicaUy, RU 486 blocks progesterone,  a hormone responsible for producing and  maintaining the Hning of the uterus so that  a fertilized egg can implant itself and develop. If RU 486 is taken within the first 49  days of pregnancy, the uterine Hning stops  growing and a miscarriage occurs.  Taken on its own, RU 486 is reported  to be 60-80 percent effective in terminating  pregnancies. When taken with a synthetic  prostaglandin, a substance which causes the  uterus to contract, the success rate climbs  to about 95 percent.  France is so far the only country to market RU 486. A French woman choosing  a chemically-induced abortion must make  several visits to one of about 800 hospitals  and chnics which administer the drug. On  her first visit she is given a pregnancy test  and a physical examination, and then she  signs a consent form. The drug is only legal  for up to the 49th day of pregnancy, and  smokers, diabetics and women with high  cholesterol are discouraged from taking it.  French law requires a one-week so-called  "cooling-off" period for women who request  an abortion. After this time, she returns to  take three mifepristone (RU 486) pUls in the  presence of a nurse or doctor.  The woman revisits the chnic 36-48 hours  later to receive a synthetic prostaglandin,  given as an injection or vaginal suppository. The women stay at the chnic for four  hours, since 90 percent of abortions occur  shortly after the prostaglandin is administered, (about 10 percent of the women abort  at home). Many women have described the  actual abortion as simUar to a heavy period,  accompanied by Hght to considerable bleeding for up to two weeks. Other common  short-term side effects of the drug include  cramping, nausea, dizziness and fatigue.  On the final visit to the clinic, a doctor makes sure aU fetal matter has been ex-  peUed. If this is not the case, the woman undergoes a surgical abortion.  Stops and Starts  The story of RU 486 as an abortifadent is  full of stops and starts, but mainly stops.  It was developed by the French pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclaf and was first  tested on women in 1982 in Switzerland. Six  years later the drug was approved for mar-  ke ting in France.  Within a month of its launch, Roussel-  Uclaf withdrew the drug from the market because anti-choice groups threatened  to boycott the company's entire range of  products. Then 48 hours later, RU 486 was  back on the shelves. The French government, which owns 36 percent of the company, intervened, prompted by the outcry from health activists and international  physicians. Minister of Health, Claude Evin,  proclaimed RU 486 to be "the moral property of women."  Feminists and physicians in Germany  have faded to get the drug introduced there.  Hoechst AG, the German chemical giant  which owns over 60 percent of Roussel-  Uclaf, buckled under pressure from the  Cathohc church and other conservative organizations to bar RU 486 from the market.  In the United States, chnical trials  on RU 486 started at the University of  Southern Cahfornia in the mid-1980s. In  February 1990, after about 400 women  had undergone chemically-induced abortions, Roussel-Uclaf cut off supplies untU  the abortion debate in the US was "resolved." Decoded, the company was afraid  of an anti- choice boycott.  Chnical trials have been conducted in  several countries, including England, Sweden, Norway and China. Britain wUl Hkely  approve it for sale this year, and Scandinavia and The Netherlands are expected to  foUow.  Asked if Roussel-Uclaf would apply for  approval to seU RU 486 in Canada, Ariel  Mouttet, spokesperson for Roussel-Uclaf in  France, told Kinesis: "Absolutely not. We  wUl only try to seU the drug in countries  where abortion is legal, and where it is  widely accepted by medical, pohtical and  public opinion. The latter is not the case in  Canada."  Is it possible that a sophisticated transnational Hke Roussel-Uclaf is unaware that  abortion is perfectly legal in Canada and  that the majority of Canadians are consistently pro-choice? Or is the company preferring to save itself from the wrath of the  anti-choice minority?  Janice Raymond, of Women and Technology at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, is preparing a detaUed critical report on RU 486 to be released in June.  She has found that 90 percent of medical journal articles on the drug were written by Roussel-Uclaf or affiliates and urges  more unbiased testing by independent researchers. In a recent article in Spare Rib,  she writes that many feminists are reluctant to critique the drug for fear they wUl  play into the hands of the right wing. But,  Raymond forcefuUy argues, "women have  the right to question whether RU 486 can  provide safe and effective abortions." Some  studies have shown that the drug's activities may disturb the body's metabohsm and  interfere with future ovulation.  Joy Thompson, spokesperson for the BC  CoaUtion of Abortion Chnics, says that  whUe the coahtion does not have a clearly  defined position on RU 486, they beheve  that abortion morally belongs in the hands  of women and so support any safe method  which ensures this.  As a health activist, Thompson would  welcome clinical trials of the drug in  Canada, providing the testing methodology  respected women's rights. Women would  need to be fuUy informed of the testing procedure and give their medical consent.  Thompson questions the necessity for a  woman to make repeated visits to a chnic,  as in France. "There is no need for women  to be sat in Hnes and watched as they swallow pUls. Just as the rest of the population, women foUow prescriptions moderately weU." She would Hke to see a safe abortion pUl prescribed by the woman's physician, who would advise her of aU Hkely  complications of the drug and give foUow-  up tests. "Then," Thompson says, "we wUl  have achieved our ultimate goal which is  that abortion is a personal decision between  a woman and her doctor."  In Toronto, Connie Clement, health activist and co-founder of Healthsharing  magazine, is also interested in seeing chnical  trials of the drug in Canada. If the drug is  marketed here, she too would Hke to see the  Canadian feminists and health activists  need to be more agressive in their  pursuit of information on RU 486  and its effects, in order to  define a clear position on this drug.  Roussel Canada Inc., the Canadian subsidiary, markets a variety of antibiotics and  pain rehevers in Canada. Medical Director  Jacques Garau would not respond to Kinesis ' repeated requests for an interview.  Outside of the anti-choice camp, criticism of the drug is limited. Results of chnical studies in medical journals are positive.  China tested the drug on over 2,000 women,  and in 1988 reported a 94 percent success  rate in achieving complete abortions, as did  a study in the United Kingdom conducted  on 5SS. women. , ,,,,,,,,,,:,,v.x,,,.v,,,.:.v:,,,,,,,,,,...,,.,.,..,,,,,  number of clinic visits reduced, but is skeptical of women having abortions alone. "I  think the isolation many women would experience because they are not comfortable  talking about abortion and [often] lack famUy support for it, would be problematic."  Rather than relying on doctors to ensure  the woman is clear on the abortion decision, Clement would encourage counselling  services for women such as the type offered  at free-standing abortion chnics.  Clement is somewhat hesitant about the  tjr.ug; how . I health  activists have jumped on the bandwagon for  RU 486 very quickly. I worry that some of  the caution we have brought to other drugs  has [diminished] in our desire for additional  abortion mechanisms."  Hilda Thomas, spokesperson for the Everywoman's Health Centre in Vancouver,  says the centre is skeptical about RU 486,  noting that in reproductive research: "the  direction is always in trying to manipulate  women's bodies in very sophisticated ways  which often have unforseen side effects."  Given that anti-choice groups frequently harass women trying to access abortion chnics,  however, Thomas says that anything which  could help protect a woman's right to privacy is a plus.  According to Clement, two French studies reported that an unexpected benefit of  RU 486 is that women feel more involved  in their abortions and that they define  this as positive. "This is opposite to the  view that the medical community takes in  Canada," says Clement, "where, except for  making the decision to have an abortion,  women are [rendered] passive." The overwhelming majority of abortions performed  in Canadian hospitals are done under general anaesthetic, whUe free-standing abortion chnics typically use a local anaesthetic.  Says Clements, "With RU 486, women feel  a high level of involvement which facilitates  the resolution of any conflicts they might  have had when making the decision to have  an abortion."  Thomas comments that the Everywoman's Health Centre uses only tranquiHzers  and relaxation techniques during the abortion procedure, and that the vacuum aspiration method is generaUy fairly simple. "It  also has the benefit that women can receive  counselhng, empowerment and birth control  counselhng." While she agrees that any surgical procedure is undesirable, she remains  unconvinced that RU 486 represents a great  advance.  Blame the Feminists...  Then Stop Researching  Many activists would Hke to see more funding for research on birth control devices,  specificaUy barrier methods and male contraceptives, so that women can avoid unwanted pregnancies. But contraceptive research of any type in North America is at a  virtual standstill, and it has become fashionable to blame feminist health activists  for the state of neglect.  In the 1970's, 13 companies in the US  were active in this area of research, but a series of costly Htigation cases involving contraceptive devices panicked the pharmaceutical industry. Government approval regulations were tightened and Habihty insurance  became almost impossible to get. Pharmaceutical companies complained it was no  longer profitable to conduct this type of research, and most withdrew from the field,  pointing their finger at women's groups and  health activists who had frequently been  involved in instigating and publicizing the  lawsuits.  The industry doesn't bother mentioning  that thousands of women had been severely  harmed—and an unknown number kiUed—  by faulty contraceptive products, and that  without the lawsuits and more stringent  regulations, that number would have been  much higher. As for the crisis in contraceptive HabiUty insurance, it is just part of the  overall HabiUty insurance crisis now stran-  .gUn&the.US,.............. ...:........  Only one large company, Ortho Pharmaceuticals, continues contraceptive research  in the US. According to Marcena Levine of  Planned Parenthood of BC, it is also the  sole company to conduct any contraceptive  research in Canada, and that research is  only in its initial phase.  There have been no major new contraceptives introduced into Canada since the  1960's when the pUl and the intra-uterine  device (IUD) appeared on the market. The  same was true in the US untU the beginning  of this year, when Norplant made its entry.  The Norplant device consists of six thin,  short tubes, which are surgicaUy implanted  into a woman's upper arm. The tubes release an artificial progesterone for up to five  years.  Quite aside from possible adverse long-  term effects on women's health, Norplant  vividly Ulustrates how some contraceptives  can give the state effective control over  women's bodies. A Cahfornia judge recently  ordered a convicted chUd abuser to have the  device implanted as a condition for her parole. A Kansas state legislator is proposing  that women on welfare be offered $500 as  an incentive to choose Norplant, and that  women found to be in possession of heroin  or cocaine be implanted with the device in  order to receive probation.  Elsewhere in the world, a five-year in-  jectible contraceptive is being used in several countries, including western Europe.  China and Mexico each produce a one-  month version of the product. Skin patches  and bandages saturated with hormones are  being researched, and the World Health Organization recently announced a 65 percent  success rate in producing reversible sterUity  in men who were given weekly testosterone  injections.  Disturbingly, these products are aU  highly complex and carry within their  chemical makeup the potential to wreak  havoc on those who use them. And, as has  long been the tradition with contraceptives,  they are aU, with one exception, to be used  by women.  Drugs That Kill  The first reported death connected with RU  486 occurred in early AprU 1991. A 31-year  old French woman who had taken the drug  died of heart faUure an hour after being  given the prostaglandin injection. She was  a smoker with no history of heart trouble.  She was also in her 13th pregnancy and reportedly had 11 Hving chUdren.  The prostaglandin (trade name Nalador)  is being blamed in the woman's death, not  RU 486. Ariel Mouttet of Roussel-Uclaf said  three other women in the past year have  died after being given Nalador, although  they had not taken RU 486. And she says  animal lab tests have shown that RU 486 in  combination with a prostaglandin does not  increase the risk of heart attack.  Nalador is the prostaglandin most frequently used by French abortion chnics and  Roussel-Uclaf wUl now be recommending a  different brand. The French Health Ministry  is expected to issue new guidelines concerning the use of RU 486, including banning its  use for smokers and women over thirty-five.  Hilda Thomas beheves that in the case  of the woman who recently died, attention  should be given to the number of chUdren  she had. "I would suggest that to put any  woman in that position is something of a  scandal. It shows how little real attention  has been paid to the oppression of women  and their lack of reproductive choices."  RU 486 has leapt into the headlines because of its abihty to induce abortion, but  researchers are now interested in the drug  for its potential to treat a vast array of Ul-  nesses, including breast cancer, brain tumours, Cushing's syndrome (some of whose  symptoms are osteoporosis, diabetes and  high blood pressure), depression and ADDS.  The drug has even been cited as potentiaUy  slowing down the natural aging process.  But because of anti-choice hysteria and  boycott threats, clinical trials on RU 486 in  aU these capacities have largely been frozen  in North America.  RU 486 is most widely understood as  an abortifadent and over the next decade,  more and more women around the world  wUl Hkely turn to this alternative to a surgical abortion. Canadian feminists and health  activists need to be more aggressive in their  pursuit of information on RU 486 and its  effects, in order to define a clear position  on this drug. Does its risks outweigh those  of surgery? Does it enhance a woman's privacy? Does it give her more control?  Or is RU 486 simply another unnecessar-  Uy complicated drug damaging to women's  health?  It is important that we find the answers  to these questions soon. If RU 486 is not  avaUable in Canada, it must be because we  do not want it, and not because the shriU  voice of the anti-choice squad has dictated  the drugs to which we have access.

Commentary  Single mothers:  The heroes of our times  by Peggy Watkins  The day stretches long before me: hours  of caring, cleaning, dressing, washing, cooking, stepping over toys spread out on the  living-room floor. The day wUl be spent  worrying about work and daycare, today's  problems and the future's concerns, finances  and "can I fit insurance payments into the  budget?" It wUl be 16 hours (at least) of  non-stop, tiring, demanding work.  But then my son opens his eyes and his  smUe fiUs the room with sunshine. I realize that even though being a single mother  is exhausting and the responsibihties can  be overwhelming, it is also a Hfe fiUed with  many moments of smaU joys, feehngs of  accomplishment and the spedal love that  mothers and chUdren share.  Too often in the media we hear only one  side of the story. We hear about the struggles and pain, but we seldom hear about  the triumphs and joy. We are presented  with a one-dimensional stereotype of a single mother.  There is no one single mother. She may  be 20 or 36, divorced or never married, lesbian or heterosexual. She may be coping  with toddlers or surviving the teen years. As  an individual she defies the cardboard cutout description we so often see in the media.  Since becoming a single mother myself,  when I meet with other single mothers I  am continually amazed by these incredible  women. The public usuaUy thinks of a single mother as a poor, down-trodden wreck,  someone to be pitied or looked down on. But  single mothers don't need pity—we need to  be respected and valued for our important  work. We need to feel good about ourselves  and each other, and to demand the changes  that are necessary to support what we do.  I wanted other people to hear the voices  of the women doing the work, the women  doing the chUd-rearing. Paula, Kathy and  Heather are three women I talked with. All  felt frustrated by the limited version of single mothers so often portrayed in the media.  Heather explains: "Mostly they don't talk  about single mothers. They just talk about  middle-dass famiUes with a mother and a  father ... except when they talk about single mothers on welfare. They don't include  them in stories about mainstream families."  Paula points out: "They think we're uneducated, stupid. They think 'it's aU your  fault;' they never put any of the responsibiUty on the father." Heather adds: "People  think we don't want to be single mothers,  that we can't handle it alone. They think  our main goal in Hfe is to find a father for  our chUd."

"Education, working,  babysitting—making them aU work together," says Paula. "On welfare, I couldn't  get a babysitter without a job and couldn't  get a job without a babysitter. I had to kind  of He." Heather talked about the problems  of day-to-day surviving: "It's trying not to  be too stressed out. In the long run it's—  are you making the right decisions?"  The question of fathers inevitably comes  up. Kathy feels that you have to "play the  role of the man, the father as weU. Sometimes you feel you're not able, but you pretend." Answering kids' questions can be  hard. "They want to know why they don't  have a dad. I can't say the real thing—they  don't understand," Kathy added. More to  the point for many, however, is Paula's comment: "Improve things? Get his father to  give me money!"  All the women agreed that day care was  a serious problem and the lack of it an  obstacle to employment. As Heather said:  "They [the government] say get a job but  they don't fund day care." Many single  mothers are trying to survive on Hmited  resources. "It's challenging and rewarding  and depressing and hard and it makes you  a strong person ... I wouldn't change it."  For me, single mothers are the heroes of our  times.  So think about your perception of "the  typical single mother" and question that  stereotype. H you're not a single mother,  take the time to talk to someone who is anc  try to understand what it's aU about from  their point of view. Leave your preconceptions at the door and reaUy get to know that  person as an individual, with unique qualities and concerns. And if you can, find z  way to make that person's Hfe a Httle easier. (A couple of hours of free babysitting  can be a godsend.)  If you are a single mother, think about  how you view other single moms. If you hold  negative preconceptions, you could be dragging down your own self esteem (as weU as  doing them no favour). Do tilings that start  to make you feel good about yourself and  other single mothers. You could join a single  mothers' support group, lobby for increased  day care funding or higher welfare rates, or  give yourself more credit for the important  and challenging work you do.  It's time for single mothers to stand up  and demand that they be treated as individuals, not stereotypes. It's time for us to  demand that we be respected for our contributions to this society and given more support.

I  was writing an article for a local arts magazine about the upsurge of independent galleries in the area. Before meeting the gallery  owners for an interview, I was first confronted with a large roomful of paintings of  Black women—mostly nude, with streams  of colours emanating from their bodies, full  breasts with perky nipples proudly pointing  at my face.  It was one of my most uncomfortable moments.  While interviewing the gallery owners  I couldn't avoid being distracted and increasingly disturbed by the paintings surrounding us. People walked into the gallery  as we talked. They came in to admire  the exhibit—to more closely examine the  artist's interpretation of nude Black women  with their vaginas indiscriminately welcoming every passerby's gaze, sizeable breasts  revealed as if they were available for any  horny spectator to suckle. As the only three-  dimensional Black woman in the midst of aU  this, I felt violated.  Thorsen's paintings have since appeared  at various local venues (Smash, A Walk Is  ..., Artropohs, and the Vancouver East  Cultural Centre). And they were on display (once again) at the Fifty-Six GaUery  in AprU.  The recurring presence of Thorsen's  paintings over the past year has struck a  nerve buried deep in my historical and pohtical consciousness. How can a weU-meaning  but misdirected white woman guiltlessly  take the Hberty to toy with Black women's  bodies in the predominantly white, traditionally male Vancouver alternative art  scene? The paintings are for sale—Black  women once again price tagged for the indulgence of privUeged buyers. And the people responsible for perpetrating this exploitation fad to recognize how they are aggravating old wounds. Women have had to  inform them. And then we have had to endure the justifications of their oppressive  practices, when they faU to understand why  the anger they provoke is legitimate.  I was informed by a gallery owner last  year that Thorsen chooses to paint Black  women to foster a sense of positive racial  identity for her young daughter, whose father is Black. This, however, doesn't grant  her Ucence to further perpetuate and accentuate stereotypes of Black women. Thorsen  represents Black women as fertUe, overly  sexual, exotic "Others"; she also feeds into  the stereotype of the "Mammy"—Black  women as essentiaUy, happUy, and eternally care-givers. Thorsen paints at our expense. Her works remind me that this society has a superficial understanding of the  pain associated with the histories of oppressed people—our colonized cultures, our  colonized bodies. If this artist really understood, she would not be indulging in her  fascination with Black women as sexuaUy  potent subjects, "capturing" them with her  imagination.  Profiting on Fragmented Histories  My reaction to Thorsen's paintings is informed by an awareness of hundreds of years  of the fetishization and objectification of  Black women's bodies. In slavery times, the  breasts Thorsen paints were used to wet  nurse white women's babies whUe Black babies were left to hunger.  Stereotypes exist and we can't expect everyone wUl heed Thorsen's words printed on  a blackboard hung inside the gallery where  the "I Love Titty" exhibit hangs: "Hopefully, the audience wUl look past their own  stereotyping and see the positive expression  in my work."  Hoping just isn't enough. The stereotypes persist, and the paintings are not  challenging those stereotypes—if anything,  they're reinforcing them. Thorsen's fascination with the exotic, erotic "Other"  can dangerously buttress some people's desires to "own" a Black woman—a three-  dimensional one, or one neatly packaged in  a painting (one which has no voice to talk  back, one which has no resistance to their  gazes).  Most of us are stiU ignorant of our deeply  interiorized racism, classism and sexism.  This comes from a lack of understanding  of the many masks of colonization. People of European descent in North America  have continually interpreted, re-interpreted,  represented and misrepresented people of  African descent—in their education systems, in media and advertising, and, yes,  in their art. The ongoing process of cultural appropriation in art (notably in literature) has already been vocally challenged by  many First Nations people and their aUies.  Thorsen explains that the writings of Alice Walker, Maya Angelou and other Black  women have inspired her paintings. But  her appropriation of Black women's words  as text to conveniently enhance her work  masks the social structures which aUow her  profiteering on the backs of Black women  authors and activists. The words of these  women are used out of context—hollowly  repeated as subservient subtexts to the  musings of Thorsen's paintbrush.  Detail from a work by Katarina Thorsen  She also seUs a roughly painted representation of pohtical activist Sojourner  Truth—bare breasted—with a fragment  of Truth's "Ain't I A Woman" speech  printed below. This was particularly offensive. Thorsen cannot expect everyone who  sees her work to understand the pain and  frustration associated with Truth's words,  given the lack of knowledge most Canadians have of African-American history. In  fact, my experiences have been that people here know surprisingly Httle about Afro-  Canadian history.  Thorsen writes in her explanatory text:  "The repeated images of the Black female  is the form that best presents my message,  concerns and explorations." She uses the descriptor "Black females" as if we were another species. It reeks of anthropological objectification.  Her text also states: "The great female  experiences are menstruation, pregnancy,  childbirth, nursing. Painting is my personal  the potential victims of in vitro fertUiza  tion techniques—mostly poor women in the  States, many of whom are Black and Hispanic. In California last faU, a Black "surrogate" mother was denied custody of the  baby she gave birth to. The woman, Anna  Johnson, claimed that the couple whose  egg and sperm were implanted in her body  were treating her pregnancy with indifference and were late with their contract payments. The case had severe racial implications, since the man whose sperm was implanted was white and the egg was taken  from his Fihppina wife.  In slavery times, the breasts Thorsen  paints were used to wet nurse white women's  babies while Black babies were left to hunger.  nightly ritual to celebrate and explore the  abstract of these experiences. My personal  celebration of Goddess—the rehgion of the  Earth ... " It may be Thorsen's fancy  to explore and search for "a Goddess rehgion." But why publically expose our bodies for everyone else's exploration, gratification and consumption? This is colonization.  I held my temper when I was the only Black  woman examining three of Thorsen's larger-  than-life paintings advertised in a gallery  window on Denman Street last month. The  paintings displayed nameless, history-less  Black women with their breasts confidently  bared, decorated with jewelry. That, for me,  was the last straw.  Our Wombs Have Been For Sale  All of Thorsen's subjects are young and  voluptuous, several are "vogue," and some  ...this society  has a superficial  understanding  of the pain  associated with  the histories  of oppressed  people...  are characteristic of nameless National  Geographic curiosities. They are far from  representative of the diversity of "the Black  female" which so inspires and intrigues  her. Where are the older Black women in  Thorsen's imagination? All of her Black  "Goddesses" are preserved in their youth.  She opens our vaginas to the world,  and indeed, our vaginas are not always  our own. Thorsen's images remind me of  Such applications of in vitro fertiUzation  are creating situations in which less privUeged women are (once again) treated as  chattel. What kind of destinies are being  mapped out for women of colour and Aboriginal women with the uses of such technologies? Our wombs have been put up for  sale, and we have been denied control over  our bodies and destinies as "justice" is determined in a colonial court system—the  same judicial system that endorsed and protected slavery of our ancestors.  Thorsen was confronted by several women outraged by her AprU 8 opening at the  Fifty-Six GaUery. She apologized to me anc  several others who disapproved of the offen  sive paintings. But if she, and the gallery  curators who display these paintings, really  cared, then the paintings would be removed  from public scrutiny and not be made avaU  able for sale. Their lack of action demon  strates a resistance to confront and change  their ethnocentric—yes—racist, behaviour  There are proportionately few Black  artists in Canada who have the institutional support and funding—the privUege—  to make a decent Hving as visual artists.  This situation has created a profes'  which is dominated by non-Black artists. So  who, then, is mediating Black Canadians'  racial and cultural realities for the genera  public? Why must people hke Thorsen interpret our realities and continually justify  their transgressions?  At the exhibit opening, people celebratec  Thorsen's images. Spectators wrote that  they loved the vibrant colours she uses, her  freedom of expression. UntU argumentation  and confrontation disrupted the comfort o:  the social atmosphere, I was utterly disgusted.  I hope that Thorsen wUl come to acknowledge her position of privUege and how  she is maintaining control over images o:  our bodies, our experiences and fragmentec  histories.

KINESIS ssssss^ssss*s>^^  ARTS  BOA's art exhibit:  Wanting more than  surviving oppression  by Morgan McGuigan  The following is a review of the visual art exhibition Women Surviving Oppression, a cultural series organized in  March and April by BOA (A Bevy  of Anarcha-feminists, in Vancouver).  Women Surviving Oppression also presented two cabaret evenings of video,  poetry and music.  Women Surviving Oppression was a visual autobiography of women's hves in  North America. The exhibition, which ran  for three weeks in Vancouver in March  and AprU, included art pieces about single  mothers, abortion, slashing, sex, women's  body images, media, rape, violence against  women—many of the painful experiences a  woman could go through in our society.  Women Surviving Oppression was not  without problems. Why was the show hung  in two separate locations, both of which  were extremely hard to get into? The Downtown Eastside Women's Centre is open from  11 to 5, Monday to Friday. The FirehaU  Theatre is open after 5 in the evening. Although the venues are near one another, it  was impossible to see both halves of the exhibit at one go. Yet the choice of what to  hang where made it essential that you see  the entire exhibit.  For instance, why was the most painful  work hung in the downtown women's centre (the women who drop-in already Hve  painful Hves) and the more celebratory, joyous pieces at the FirehaU? Was this a stereotyping of the women the organizers think  drop into the centre, and the kind of art  work they can appreciate?  her. The juxtaposition of such serious feelings against the light-hearted carousel image makes the piece even more powerful.  AdeUe Aurore presents a fascinating Hfe-  size pink Cinderella dress with cut-out tabs  entitled "New Woman." A cutaway uterus  inside the dress reveals a fully dressed  middle-aged man attached via a blood vessel to the woman's heart. "Self Portrait  Through His Eyes" by Rae Gabriel has a severe impact, showing how "in his eyes" she  is only a long Hst of bad character traits.  Perhaps the message of this exhibition is  that survival consists of staying alive under  unbearable circumstances.  How do women survive oppression? Zoe  Lambert's evocative single mother figure  running from her husband survives by  the kind help of a strange woman. Cer-  rolyn's "Leda Raped by Zeus" survives by  her beautifully painted anger. Pam Coo-  Detail Irom a drawing by Sheila Baxter  The exhibit raised questions about art,  feminism and Hfe, and was at times overwhelming, gripping and devastating. It was  also frustrating. Fm embarrassed to admit  that my first reaction to the poster advertising the show was to think: "Not another  group talking about how women have been  oppressed!" I've worked hard to develop  an analysis of women's pain and oppression and, in some ways, I've grown impatient with the raw expression of our victimization. Nevertheless, I recognize that other  women are clearly in a different place—and  they have a right to be seen and heard.  Criticisms aside, there were some gems  in this exhibition. Persimmon Blackbridge  offers a chUhng painted wooden scene of a  woman biting herself, whUe a friend wonders if this is another form of slashing.  Laura Morrison's beautiful carousel in  bronze of 10 classical women's torsos sits on  top of the piano, challenging the nude in art  tradition. As the carousel turns, each torso  is inscribed with the next step a woman  takes in distancing herself from her body  in response to outside pressures.

An elegant photograph by Kenna Fair  of two naked women hugging shows the  symmetry of women's bodies, with curve  set inside of curve and breast tucked under breast—surviving with a lover's support. Ione's refreshing smaU clay planter of  a woman's bottom held up by wing-like Hues  shows that women's bodies are not simply  pornographic: she reclaims women's bodies  for feminists.

Women Surviving Oppression contained  pieces by established artists hung beside  those by amateurs. I wondered what the organizers were trying to say by this eclectic mixture: that art-making belongs to us  aU, or that women have the same experiences whether they are full-time or amateur  artists, and that by putting them together a  kind of solidarity might emerge. Perhaps the  message is that creativity contains a kernel  of strength "on which wimmin draw to do  battle in daily Hfe ... " (said their leaflet).  This is aU true and I appreciated what they  were trying to do.  But I'm not sure that it worked. Much as  I Hked individual pieces in the exhibition, I  question the show's overall conception.  I question a show that presents itself as  women surviving oppression in the nineties.  I agree that women in our society Hve under oppression and that it is important to  remind ourselves and others of that fact-  to acknowledge the pain and honour the  women who hve through these experiences  and resist them in however smaU a way.  Yet I cannot help wondering: is survival all  we can ask for? What is survival? Don't  we want to do more than merely survive  in our Hves? Are women stiU struggling after so many years of feminism just to prove  that our oppression exists? In presenting a  show dedicated to exhibiting oppression and  women surviving it, are the organizers stating that there is only oppression in women's  Hves?  The one-dimensional view of women'  Hves that I sensed in this exhibit present  women as victims and survivors only, never  actors in determining their own Hves.  Women react, they don't act.  Perhaps the lack of other dimensions is  a missing element in feminism today. UntU  femimsts stop focusing so much on our victim status, on our hurts, injuries and mistreatments, and untU we start to acknowledge the power we do have—and we aU have  power and can act—we wUl not change the  pohtical, economic and patriarchal power  base we Hve under. We won't even change  our own difficult hves. We wUl continue to  talk about our pain in smaU marginal art  shows, therapy groups and feminist collectives, and I do not think we wUl attain the  victories that we deserve.

May 91 Arts  yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  THE WOMEN'  GOTSli  Creeps, take a memo:  These women fight back  THE WOMEN THAT GOT AWAY  video by Chris McDoweU  Vancouver: 1990  by Bonnie Waterstone  Sexual assault of women is standard sensational fare for the mainstream media,  yet there is a deafening sUence surrounding  the stories of women who successfuUy fight  back. Chris McDoweU's video profiles some  great success stories and helps to balance  out the popular image of women as victims.  The video opens and closes with a short  segment from a self-defense class. Three segments of interviews with women telling their  true Hfe stories of escape are interspersed  with a panel of self-defense experts commenting on the stories.  The stories of escape deal first with stories of women who got away using assertiveness and verbal self-defense. In the second  and third segments, the women fight back  using varying degrees of physical force.  The interviews were exciting, partiaUy  because of the use of location. H the incident  took place on a street corner, the woman is  interviewed on a street corner, with aU the  traffic noise as ambience. The laundromat  incident is described with the dryers rolhng  and roaring away in the background.  But mostly it is the excitement of hearing  of danger and hearing of escape. The dangers described are ones women often face,  so there is the recognition: "this could have  been me." From an exhibitionist masturbating in the doorway, to being forced on a date  to have sex when you don't want to, these  situations are famihar to women. I found  myself Hstening and wondering: "and then  what? and then what?" That all the stories  end with the women standing up for themselves and getting away from the creep or  creeps is exhilarating.  In contrast, the three panelists are much  less interesting—although they have plenty  of self-defense experience. Anita Roberts  teaches in Vancouver high schools through  the Sexual Assault Awareness for Every  Teenager program (SAAFE—Teen) and has  been studying the "sociaHzation of women  and the psychology of rape" since 1976.  Alice MacPherson, who has taught self-  defense since 1972, gives classes through  the organization she founded, Women Educating in Self-Defense Trainbg, or WenHdo  WEST. Joni MiUer, who took her first self-  defense class from AUce :n 1979, has taught  classes throughout BC and has done rape  crisis work. MiUer, who earned her black  belt in Karate in 1988, now teaches an aU-  women karate class as weU as classes for  chUdren aged six to twelve.  Unfortunately, Roberts monopohzes the  panel, jumping in to contribute even when  the questions are directed to the others. The  interviewer encourages Roberts, even asking her to discuss how she helps high school  students get in touch with their inner selves.  You may wonder what this has to do  with self-defense, but in Roberts' analysis,  it does. As she explains, a woman first reacts from her hurt chUd—reacting with fear.  When attacked, a woman needs to take her  Httle girl and tuck her into bed with a teddy,  then contact her anger, which she personifies as "the bitch" and teU "the bitch" to  stand behind in case she needs her, and then  respond from "the wise woman"—respond  assertively, neutraUy.  As a self-defense instructor myself, I  found this a bit roundabout. I would recommend just kicking the creep in the kneecaps  and worrying about your inner personae  once you are safely away.  Quite a few valuable points are made  about fighting back in this video. The importance of resisting strongly, especiaUy at  the beginning of an attack, is emphasized  by the panehsts and echoed in the interviews. In one of the most exciting stories,  told by "Jesse, a lawyer", Jesse fights off  four men who have picked her up and are  dragging her up a stairweU. "The instant  they put their hands on me I responded,"  she describes. She punched, kicked, and  grabbed—a crotch, a finger—and held on  to the point of breaking the finger. At this  point the men took off.  Many self-defense tips were offered in  this video, and the panehsts supported each  other's comments. Fighting back in a variety of ways and keeping on fighting on—  not just doing one thing then stopping—  was emphasized by MacPherson. Roberts  stressed the importance of assertive body  language combined with assertive verbal  messages. MiUer commented on the importance of buUding self-esteem and noted that  every woman has the capacity to defend herself. They aU talked about how it is never  the woman's fault if she is attacked, and  Chris McDowell and Kirsten Shaw  on the set of The Women That Got Away  about how often it is someone you know who  attacks you (about 80 percent of the time).  Unfortunately, interviewer Linda Mossing does a very poor job with the panel. She  stumbles over questions which are at best  inane, and a viewer has to assume she was  reading off cue cards. Wooden and nervous,  Mossing detracts a lot from the talk show  parts of the video.  The Women Who Got Away celebrates women's strength. These true life stories are exciting and encouraging. Watch  for screenings of this video and take your  friends, your sister, your daughter, your  mother. Maybe we can all start telHng the  stories of when we did not get raped, when  we got out of dangerous situations, when we  got away. If we spread the word, maybe instead of it being considered unsafe to be a  woman alone, it wiU be considered unsafe to  attack a woman alone.

A riotous romp  through language  CONFESSIONS: a Jazz Play  by Sheri-D WUson  directed by Teri Snelgrove  Tamahnous Theatre, Vancouver, AprU  by Meg Edwards  It's opening night and the eager audience  has jammed itself into the tiny Tamahnous  Theatre and settled, with some trepidation,  on the tiny metal chairs. We are greeted by  a lone trumpet player, John Korsrud, jazz-  Uy jiving in the rafters of the Cathedral.  Soon we are traveHng through the aUeys  of a jazz-infused, Catholic-confused mind.  Confessions is a poetic exploration of rehgion, language, sex, sin and love. Icons  and metaphors are mixed with abandon,  and "everything is simultaneous." In other  words, let your mind go, sister. Sheri-D WUson, Vancouver's weU-known performance  poet, has created quite a show—a show best  seen in beret, smoke in hand.  In her search for spirituality and pregnancy, our protagonist Lola, high on Coca  Cola and experiencing an "aspertame brain  drain," faUs through a "man hole"into the  catacombs of the unconscious. She wants a  Father to be the father of her chUd. She  wants to feel the quickening of pregnancy,  the presence of Hfe in her womb. Father  Gabriel Heart joins her in the verbal gymnastics that is their foreplay—whether they  go any further is never made exphcit.  Puns, word play and "Freudian" sUps  dance through the script, whUe poetry and  musical riffs give the play the feeling of a reaUy big, weU-produced performance piece.  This is not an in-depth analysis of Catholi-  cism or sexual politics, so don't torture  yourself looking for a web of logic behind  the word games. Confessions is a riotous  romp through language, with an emphasis  on play.  The set, created by Susan Madsen, was  magical and inventive. The actors paced  above and around the audience, entering  and exiting from a trap door in the ceiUng,  the manhole to New York's streets. Smoke,  sand, fire and water added symbohc and  aesthetic dimensions to the play. In fact, the  turbulence of words and images, sounds and  smoke was quite a heady experience.  The three performances, Alex Diakun  as Father Heart, Sheri-D Wilson as Lola,  and James Fagan Tait as Sand/Blue Lu  were equaUy impressive. Blue Lu (apparently God, the blues singer) was ecstatic  in his blue underwear and see-thru gauze  dress, and Sheri-D's performance was immaculate. The performers displayed great  energy and seemed to work in perfect harmony.  The only discordant moments in the play  were when the script, on the whole humourous and inventive, lapsed into cHche.

A richly layered text,  Strings is a medieval passion play spoof,  a puppet show, an opera, a modern dance  and a serious modern examination of symbols, music and theology.  ...The siren song  became the female  body: strong and  beautiful and capable...  For a medievahst, this work could be  taken very seriously. But even if you don't  know a darn thing about medieval society, it  wouldn't matter. Strings is pure theatrical  spectacle, visually satisfying, intellectually  challenging, with an aesthetically clever set  and costumes set to a complexly haunting  operatic score/voice over text. It is a work  of international standing and hopefuUy the  cast wUl take Strings on a European tour.  Working in flawless concert, the three  stage characters symbohze the Christian  trinity: God is a wUdly painted actor/female  on stilts who is tied by strings to the Great  Mother who is tied to a male puppet dressed  in newspaper and, as an audience member  pointed out, looks Hke Pierre Trudeau. Off  centre stage is a woman radical chic narrator who delivers dehcious commentary in  voice and song.  The visual art of Strings could stand  alone. Costumes are a sensory delight,  pecially provocative is a string bikini-like  costume worn by the Mother/woman, her  hair-horns attached to the puppet. Seeing  is believing. The main prop is a brUUantly  designed, gargoyle-adorned, painstakingly  painted sUk cathedral, painted by Rosen  from photos of actual churches and designed  by Simon PurceU who also co-wrote and  directed Strings. Stilt-god is an amazing  creature in white ruffled sUk and face paint  mask.  We are talking about strings within  strings and characters within characters.  Male within female and female within male.  Like, who made who? God on stUts/stUted  god pulls on the woman who pulls on the  man who pulls on god. Me and my shadow,  so to speak. Projections of the human mind.  Off-stage, a character sings siren-Hke—  at once haunting and exquisite—and gives  a dialectic diatribe against the maleness of  god: "I am the apple of his eye/the centre  of his eye." The woman "matrix of society"  sings (with her amazing voice) back to the  siren voice and we have an operatic layer to  the seduction of Strings.  Time moves from the ancient to primitive to modern with god and woman eventuaUy metaphorphasizing into a ridiculous  symbiosis of god/snake and mother/son.  God strings her along and—we know this  story—she cuts the cord and gets on with  her connection to man: "You used me, you  made me, you need me! I am puUing these  CONFESSIONS from page 17  When Father Heart tucks her in and tells  Lola the story of original sin, I hoped for  a new perspective on the Adam and Eve  story. As it turned out, his story leads to  the one direct comment in the play about  women and Catholicism. Reacting to the  loss-of-innocence tale Lola says, as an offside, "When did this happen? This must  have been after the Goddess and before fem-  The courtship between Lola and the Father is highlighted by confession scenes.  As Blue Lu announces at the beginning,  hanging out of the trapdoor, "CaU 1-900-  CONFESSIONS, and hear real confessions  from real people." The scenes are entangled  with sexual tensions. After one particularly  steamy confession about shopping, Lola and  Father Heart stop to have a smoke and get  their breath. The sensual pleasure of smoking is really a lost art: this scene could make  a smoker out of a non-smoker.  The show culminated in a final rap song  about New York and how you love to hate  it: the sinful, soulless city in which you shop  to avoid the blues and then rend your clothing in regret. There are miUions of repressed  Cathohcs wandering New York's streets,  lost souls who have confused sexuahty with  spirituality, love with icons, guilt with God.  Lola's ultimate confession to Father  Gabriel was the scene I most enjoyed. Lola  sits in her favorite breakfast spot, True Confections, dazing out on a tripe sugar pie and  shpping into a reverie. That day, we learn,  she isn't wearing any underwear—they're  aU drying on the Hne. Musing on the funeral  parlour across the street, Lola gets an idea.  She floats over to the cake display, picks up  the biggest, most disgusting cake—a mountain of cream and chocolate appropriately  named 'Sin City'—and walks into the funeral parlour, placing the cake on the altar. Slowly she Hfts her skirt—and sits on  the cake. The audience let out in unison  a gasping 'ooh.' Sheri-D WUson the story  teller had drawn us in completely. Confessions was an enchanting experience, tightly  produced, weU written and wonderfully performed.  Meg Edwards is  an  atheist  and  is  truly mystified by the Catholic experi-  , KINESIS  strings." This may sound aU so famihar  and it is, but not in this form of passion  play/comedy/tragedy aU stunningly layered  together.  Like a medieval tapestry, it's impossible to experience aU that Strings is stringing together in one viewing. Strings has a  good ending, if you're a feminist. It Hter-  aUy breaks the passion play form by cancelling the church as the "good guy," then  puts "man" in his proper place: as a skeleton against the beautiful sUk church set.  The plague here is male ideology, hierarchy  becoming her/anarchy.  The sheer cleverness of this production  is the metamorphosis of the women stage  characters. The stilt walker and the great  mother and the siren song become the female body: strong and beautiful and capable, a mirror of us, the audience. If there  is a moral in this modern passion play,  it must be that we are creation/creators,  artists, thinkers. Strings celebrates the human abihty to create.  The Vancouver East Cultural Centre was  a fine setting for the performance. However,  the acoustics were poor and at times it was  difficult to hear the voices. Some transitions  denoting time and place were weak—there  were breaks that perhaps the music could  have better fiUed. Perhaps Hghting could  have ehminated these bald spots.  Although Strings has just finished touring, it is stiU a work in process. It wUl return, and it's being filmed for cable television. Don't miss it. Blasphemy was never so  much fun.  ^      CARD'S*  M /^RECORDS  wmm  OCTOPUS EAST  >     n  1146 Commercial § Phone: 253-0913  fyiom GailLck PieU.  fi)  New!

Pop Llama has  gained a reputation for signing hard-core  bands, but an exception is Capping Day,  featuring Laura WeUer and Bonnie Hammond. Their unique blend of guitar, xylophone, keyboards and melodic harmonies is  a welcome respite from the grunge (and I  mean grunge) sound of most bands on this  label.  The duo collaborate on aU songwriting and have taken the tradition of  "road songs"—which focus on everyday  incidents—and elevated their themes in  a haunting combination of mystery and  poignancy.  "Windshield Road" presents a loner  wishing to flee from her painful situation;  another character wishes for some form of  imagined salvation in "Visions of Mary."  Bonnie Hammond stated in a recent interview: "A lot of the songs are just about running away... It's not really a positive thing  getting on the road."  Comparisons are generaUy simphstic and  unfair; nevertheless, I think this band deserves a lot more attention than a duo Hke  the Indigo Girls. Capping Day attempts to  elevate traditional harmony with some intense lyrics. They are more than successful  with their first album, Post No Bills. (Pop  Llama: P.O.

Aster Aweke  ASTER AWEKE  Triple Earth Records, 1989  Although North Americans are becoming  famihar with the music of South Africa and  West Africa, the sounds of East Africa and  in particular the music of Ethiopia remains  virtually unknown to mainstream audiences  on this continent.  Aster Aweke's debut album challenges  the Hstener on so many levels, largely because of the diversity of the sound. Her  music incorporates orthodox music with  the karar (harp) on "Tizita," a traditional  Ethiopian ballad. "Etitite" combines pop  and dance influences with her powerful  voice. All music is sung in Aweke's native  language, Amharic.  Aster Aweke often finds herself compared  to Aretha FrankHn which she finds quite  ironic since American R&B rhythms come  straight from traditional Ethiopian grooves.  She moved to the United States nine years  ago to escape difficulties as a female performer: "In my time in Ethiopia it was hard,  nobody accepted me. I had to leave home."  CriticaUy acclaimed in Europe where her  music has been taking nightclubs by storm,  Aweke wiU be making a rare appearance in  both Vancouver and Victoria this summer  as part of their international jazz festivals.  (Triple Earth: 1-8 Whitfield Place, London,  UK, W1P 5RW.)  Exene Cervenka  RUNNING SACRED  Rhino Records, 1990  Running Sacred is the second solo work  by Exene Cervenka. Her power as a vocalist  and writer is often understated—and often  overlooked by music critics, usuaUy men. As  she says: "songwriting is about the least intellectual thing you can do. It's aU feeUng."  Cervenka creates visual and auditory  landscapes through her lyrics and music.  She recently moved to South Dakota from  Los Angeles, and a Hstener senses the urgency of the physical planet in her work. In  "Missing Nature" she sings: "stop the world  The lack of critical acknowledgement does  not seem to deter her determination to address everyday Hfe in a heightened and prolific manner.  In "Slave Labour," a quirky and offbeat  look at love affairs she writes, "are you my  job ... everybody has a boss, my boss is my  heart, I don't want to quit my job." In the  devastating song "Curtains" she addresses  the issue of sexual pohtics "He said he'd  make her Hfe complete/ he didn't say she'd  be finished when he went away."  miinniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiHiiiHiiiiiiHiHiiiHiimiiiiniHiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiK  Coming: Out on Screen  In 1988 a small group of people got together in Vancouver to plan a gay and lesbian  film festival for Celebration '90—the Gay Games. Out on Screen was born. The festival is  an annual event, now in its third year and stiU dedicated to providing the lesbian and gay  communities with images of ourselves.  As aU non-dominant cultures are only too aware, the inabiHty of a community to create  its own images and tell its own stories often results in distorted and inaccurate portrayals  within the mainstream. For lesbians and gay men, the result can be stereotypical and demeaning caricatures—or downright invisibUity. InvisibUity is a particular concern for lesbians. For example, whUe Out on Screen is committed to equal representation in the programming, each year the lesbian programming committee has a considerable chaUenge in  tracking down films: there are simply not that many lesbian feature films avaUable.  This year for the first time, Out on Screen is including a video component in recognition  of its important role in lesbian expression. As weU, a scholarship fund for upcoming filmmakers is being planned for the future to encourage the making of lesbian and gay films  within Canada. Divide and conquer has always been an effective tool against oppressed  groups and one of Out on Screen's primary aims is to create a dialogue between lesbians  and gays to ensure a strong and healthy community. We need images of ourselves and this  film festival provides it, but it also provides filmmakers with an audience. This in turn fa-  cUitates the making of more films, which wUl broaden the images avaUable to us and better reflect our true diversity. By supporting this fledgling expression of our culture, we can  only strengthen our community.  Highlights of this year's festival (May 22-26) include Nocturne, about a repressed  middle-aged woman whose Hfe changes when two young women burst into her house to  escape a rainstorm; Comrades in Arms, about lesbians and gays in the military during  world war two, and Le Film de Justine by Montreal filmmaker Jeanne Crepeau.  Out on Screen is solely run by volunteers and more lesbians are needed for this year's  festival and for the planning of next year's. Input from the community is always welcome.  Out on Screen can be reached at Box 521-1027 Davie Street, Vancouver, V6E 4L2 or a  message can be left at 683-6151. For information about the festival program, call the Arts  Hotline at 684-2787.

I have been fascinated by Cervenka since  the 70's when she and her partner John Doe  created the musical storm of X (one of LA's  first garage bands). Since splitting up and  branching out on her own, Cervenka continues to be a gifted songwriter capable of  addressing us in our own language, through  everyday symbols and mythology.

The Touch k  Gos manage to combine the influences of  Blondie, Agent Orange and even the Partridge FamUy to tackle important world issues Hke preferring cars to boyfriends. Rumour has it that all four members of the  band own classic cars.  The extraordinary vocals of Janis McKenzie and Cara's bass guitar exemplify  gifted musicians having a blast.  This band puts on a great show. It's rare  to see people having so much fun on stage  and passing that positive energy onto their  audience. Their presence is quite infectious.

Yearwood is difficult to categorize: her talents as composer and vocalist are multi-  faceted. She performs at folk festivals, was  Aster Aweke  recently commissioned by a university to  complete the Hbretto for an aU-women's  opera, and has toured Russia on a Canada  CouncU grant, teaching experimental voice.  Dead Branches Make a Noise highlights her pohtical commitment as a feminist, prison rights activist—and as a solo  artist. Since the completion of this tape,  Yearwood has toured with her folk rock  band Cheval de Guerre. Her cassette addresses classism, racism and sexism and this  is by no means an easy tape. In "gynecology" she sings about abortion, women dying in back aUeys, and the patriarchal grip  on our bodies.  Yearwood's voice is absolutely haunting.  At a recent Hve concert, accompanying herself on a squeezebox, she sang a piece about  sexual abuse that left her audience speechless. Kathleen Yearwood wUl be performing this summer at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival (they distribute her tape). Don't  miss this uncompromising and powerful performer.

Various Artistes  WOMEN OF AFRICA  CSA Records, 1989  This compUation recording introduces  the Hstener to over 15 women artists from  Africa. With the exception of SteUa Chiweshe and the MahoteUa Queens I was  not famihar with most of the artists—and  the album unfortunately contained no biographical material. I can't stop playing this  recording. It is upbeat and also includes  some of the most beautiful baUads I have  ever heard. "True Love" by Hanga featuring  Busi Ncube has proved a big hit at women's  dances and "Ukuthokoza Kwami" by Sarah  Mabokela is one of the most speU-binding  songs I've heard.

Lead singer and  guitarist Kele Fleming was one of the semi-  finalists in the Write-On Composer competition for the song "Honey," a high-energy  tune on their debut tape. Fleming, Wendy  Atkinson and Rhonda Glover are the core  of Hazel Motes. While Fleming's writing is  quite obscure at times, their melodies tend  to be quite upbeat. Crazed folk rock seems  to be the catch-aU title for Hazel Motes.

It Hves, thoroughly meshed into the fabric of our schools,  churches and institutions where we work  and play. It hides behind the faces of passivity, ignorance, arrogance, indifference; faces  we aU know and hide behind.  We Hve in a racist society and we are aU  racists. The He of the oppressor Hves in aU  of us and it is there that it must be found;  there that it must be "confronted head on  and destroyed" as Sunera Thobani states.  Racism exists at the institutional level  because it continues to exist at the individual level. As a recent participant in an Unlearning Racism Workshop, I am only too  aware that the workshop was the beginning  of a process; the beginning of the end of  powerlessness against racism at aU levels.  The focus of the workshop was directly on  confronting racist privUege and power in aU  of its guises and a succinct and understandable framework was offered to that end.  Framework as in a place to buUd from,  to buUd anew. Each woman and man coming away from a workshop must then do  the work necessary to unlearn the racism  we have aU learned and to confront racism  where she/he finds it. This takes courage.  The facUitators of the Unlearning Racism  Workshops should not and cannot be held  responsible if an individual continues to  abide by any or aU of the tenets of racism  held before taking a workshop. They offer a  valuable tool in the struggle against racism.  Their work must continue.  Valarie VanClieaf  Vancouver, BC  Should we cancel the  IWD march and rally?  Kinesis:  Three individual women took on organizing the whole International Women's Day  march and raUy in Vancouver. They advertised for people to help them—they got no  response. They wrote to women's groups:  again, no response. To my knowledge there  was no representative of any group on the  committee.  What is the IWD march and raUy aU  about? Why do we avoid being on the committee and yet show up for the event? Why  do those of us who preach equahty and justice not take the time to see that the day  we call our own reflects what we say we beheve in? Is the IWD event just a place where  we go to say heUo to our friends? Are we  tired of Hstening to the same things over  and over? Is IWD a celebration or is it just  a group of women going through the motions? What are we trying to say to ourselves and others by having the march and  raUy? Are we bored by our own rhetoric?  Do white women think that women of colour  have anything vital to say on IWD, or are  women of colour tacked on because white  women want to do the "right thing?"  I think women's groups are afraid to celebrate the successes they have accomplished  over the last 15 years because they feel  guilty about what they have not accomplished. I also think there should be no less  than ten women on the committee and at  least five of those women should be there  as representatives of groups. If we can't get  this amount of interest from the community  then we should cancel the march and raUy.  What do you think?  Dorrie Brannock  Vancouver, BC  Thanks to BOA  for giving a chance  Kinesis:  I would Hke to express my "thank you"  to BOA [Bevy of Anarcha-feminists] for giving me, an unknown artist, the chance to  express myself—through the written word  and visual art in the Women Surviving Oppression show.  I am a woman that has been oppressed  and fights daily with oppression. It was such  a positive healing experience—to let out the  pain and show through art the process of  recovery that works for me.  The organizers of this event worked hard  without pay to put on these events the same  way they produce BOA [a pubhcation] with  their own money.  Writing for Boa  Is like a giant can opener  opening my mind  Letting out the secrets of abuse  Exposing my pain  Allowing the hate  To be directed  Not at myself  but at my abusers  and healing begins.
