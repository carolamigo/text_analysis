Among  other things, the amendments'  would mean stiff fines, jail  terms, and criminal records for  anyone convicted of soliciti g  for the purposes of prostitution.  In addition to the amendments,  demonstrators focussed on the  issue of juvenile prostitution,  demanding that it be recognized  for what it is - child abuse.  "The proposed changes in the  Criminal Code have one purpose  and that it is to make criminals out of an already disadvantaged segment of the population," said youth counsellor  Rob Joyce, speaking at the rally. His main concern was for  the young who are forced to  sell their bodies on the  streets, and the many myths  that prevail about them. He accused the government of putting  real estate profits ahead of  human needs, insisting the  young have no control over the  streets and therefore are not  responsible for their situation.  Speakers cited several examples  of'police and John brutality,  but perhaps the most alarming  came from Joyce when he described an incident where L8  constables surrounded one teenager outside the Columbian Inn  on Davie Street.  "Police harassment and jail are not the  answer," he said. "The vast  majority of these young people  have severe drug dependencies  and deep-rooted emotional problems.  Well, who wouldn't '?"  A key demand of the demonstration was a call for a special  job and retraining centre located downtown as aid to providing real alternatives for  .young people and women on the  streets.  Sally de Quadros of the Alliance  for the Safety of Prostitutes  (ASP), organizers of the ral-.  ly, addressed the violence per  petrated on prostitutes by  men - police officers, Johns,  and pimps.  Not only did several pimps stop prostitutes  from attending the rally, she  said , but two police officers I  are on a major harassment campaign in the West End.  In response to escalating violence against prostitutes, ASP  publishes a 'bad trick sheet'  with descriptions and names  of violent customers.  The organization says the criminal  code amendments will further  endanger the safety of prostitutes by driving them underground.  Other speakers gave .  firsthand accounts of incidents  where they were physically attacked and unable to secure any  form of police action.  They  also talked about the increase  in police harassment.  At one point de Quadros read_a  letter sent to ASP February 2L  from Mayor Harcourt expressing  his concern for the safety of  prostitutes and women in general. The letter proposed a  meeting between ASP and the  'ñ†newly formed Sexual Offences  Squad (SOS) of the Vancouver  police force. She said ASP has  yet to hear of any further details on such a meeting, at a  time when Harcourt is, publicly  pushing for increased police  powers around prostitution, and  the criminalization of soliciting. "If he is so concerned  about our safety," she asked,  "why is he creating laws that  will jail and punish us ?" The  rally closed with demonstrators  demanding an appearance from  the mayor: "We want Harcourt,  we want Harcourt, we want our  pimp! " they chanted.  Certainly Harcourt's methods in  this matter are confusing to  both feminists and prostitutes.  The day following the demonstration, Alderman May Brown  called an., 'open meeting of  women's groups' where she told  press that women supported increased legislation regarding  street soliciting. Women's  groups invited did not include  any feminist organizations.  On the eve of the trial of a  Red Hot Video outlet in Vancouver, scheduled to begin May 9,  people are picketing the main  street Red Hot Video store in  Vancouver. The week-long picket  began May 2 and continues to  May 8"when it will culminate  in a rally at 4:30 that afternoon.  People Against Pornography, a  local group fighting the alarming escalation of pornographic  materical -for sale and rental  in B.C., organized the picket  to bring visible pressure to  bear on the Victoria trial  proceedings.  The picket is running from 6  am to 12 midnight for one week.  That represents 118 hours of  picketing which is being carried out by individuals and  groups working on the issue.  The Red Hot Video trial is an  important stage in the growing  public pressure to have the  porn franchise shut down. It's  outcome will have a precedent  setting influence on the legal  options available for dealing  with the rest of the outlets  in B.C.  Women Against Pornography is  encouraging Vancouver women to  attend the trial and will help  any interested groups or individuals with accomodation. VSW  is a contact for transportation  organizing.  City Council will be taking up  a report dealing with "sexually  explicit video films" and the  licensing of outlets selling  the tapes at their May 6 meeting. On February 15 Council  directed the Director of Social  Planning and appropriate City  officials to report back after  exploring the possibility of  using the Zoning and Development by-law to place conditions  on new retail outlets selling  or renting sex-oriented products. The report was also  asked to examine the potential  for holding public meetings and  annual reviews of permits.  There are now 14 retail outlets  in Vancouver selling 'sex-  oriented' products. Most sell  pornographic video tapes. Some  have conditional use permits  and all are licensed as 'adult  entertainment' stores. The  Red Hot Video outlets at Main  and Robson streets have time-  limited permits, however. These  permits expire on September 30,  1983.  Twelve charges under the Criminal Code of Canada regarding  possession of obscene material  for the purpose of circultation  were laid against the Main  Street store but a trial date  will not be set until June 2,  pending the outcome of the  Victoria trial which does not  end until May 22.  Council will have a series of  options placed before their  May 6 meeting. The meeting may  decide to  stop issuing permits  for the sale of pornographic  materials, but this would not  affect the stores that were  granted permanent licenses.  Tribunal sets precedent  Up until April 28, workers caught in any kind of labour  dispute were automatically refused income assistance  benefits from the Ministry of Human Resources.  Last  week, a tribunal decision of two to one reversed this  position for the first time.  Dieter Lickman, Caimaw, Local 6, works for Western  Canada Steel, and has been locked out by the employer  for several months.  He appealed the Ministry of Human  Resources for assistance in paying the rent and buying  groceries.  He was given small amounts of-crisis assistance, and told to consider a loan, or the sale of  furniture.  The Ministry argued.that responsibility for this and  other families belonged to the union, and they should  not be called upon to assist in a labour dispute. VSW  represented Dieter, and argued that the Ministry has  responsibility for any individual or family that can  show need, and that their decision was discrimination  against someone because of union membership.  The tribunal decision was an important victory in a  time of eroding union rights. Anyone interested in the  specifics of the argument should contact Susan  O'Donnell, at the VSW offices, for a copy of the appeal. 2 Kinesis May '83  MOVEMENT MATTERS  Anti-nuclear ranks on the upswing  On April 23, it seemed like all Vancouver  was united in protest as 80,000 people  converged in the city core to demonstrate  their opposition to nuclear warfare by  joining in the Walk for Peace.  The main march was met midway by a vocal  and colourful contingent from the Peace  Camp for Survival, a twenty four hour  vigil which began at noon the previous  day at the U.S. Consulate. About 500  people attended throughout the day and  evening and more than 100 people actually  camped on the concrete for the night.  Women's issues- were addressed at the camp  in a workshop conducted by People Against  Pornography, where the legitimization of  hatred and violence that is central to  pronography was connected to the rise of  militarism.  A crucial link in the building of a worldwide anti-nuclear movement has been  landed in the laps of Canadians with the  United States' proposal to test cruise  missiles in Cold Lake, Alberta this  summer. A group of women in Vancouver are  in the initial stages of planning a protest  caravan to go to Cold Lake in August.  Everyone interested is urged to attend  an open working meeting, May 15, 1:30 to  5:30, at Kits House. For more information,  call 873T9413.  On the weekend of May 20 - 23, 900 Lesbians/  Gay women from all over B.C. are expected to  attend the first B.C. Regional Lesbian Conference .  The conference will begin on Friday evening  with a cabaret, "Come out t6 the Cabaret",  featuring a theatre group, singers, drummers,  commedians, dancers. Saturday will open with  welcoming remarks followed by a day of workshops and panel discussions,  Sunday will be another day of workshops  followed in the evening by various social  and recreational events, such as a pool  tournament, steambath party^ or meeting  with other women at Cafe Babe or Sister's  Restaurant.

Crown moves to direct indictment  Legal proceedings in the case of the five  people accused of a series of bombings  accelerated on April 20 when the Crown  announced it would proceed with a direct  indictment. The move betrayed the accused's  understanding that in exchange for waiving  certain rights a preliminary hearing was  guaranteed. The indictment's splitting  of "criminal" from "political" charges  will also mean four separate trials.  The trial of Julie Belmas, Ann Hansen,  Jerry Hannah, Doug Steward and Brent  Taylor has attracted visible support  throughout the Vancouver community,  particularly during court appearances. It  would seem that this support prompted the  relocation of the trial's proceedings  from Vancouver to New Westminster,  beginning with the April 20 appearance.

May'83 Kinesis 3  ACROSS CANADA  Federal pension reform  Green Paper proposals inadequate  by Maureen McEvoy  The federal government's proposals for pension do not go far enough, two pension experts told an audience in Ottawa recently.  Louise Delude, chair of NAC's pension committee and Monica Townson, economic consultant and author, said proposals in the  government's Green Paper,-released in December, contain small improvements for women but do not address the major issues.  "Our objective should be that every woman,  regardless of marital status or lifetime  work, should have an adequate income in her  older age," said Townson.  The first tier in the retirement system is^  the government's old age pension, which is  a basic guarantee and not dependent on work  history. The current rate of old age pensions represents only 13 per cent of an  average lifetime wage and is substantially  below the poverty line. However, the Green  Paper says rates will only be increased  when "resources permit".  The second tier of the pension system is  the public pension system - the Canada and  Quebec Pension Plans (C/QPP). Any worker in  Canada who contributes to the C/QPP during  their working years is entitled to draw  from the plan upon retirement. The amount  of the monthly pension is based on total  earnings averaged over available working  years (age 19 - 65).  Several aspects of the C/QPP directly affect  women. The QPP currently has a child care  drop-out provision. A.woman who leaves the  workforce for up to seven years to care for  a young child can deduct those years when  her total earnings are averaged, thus resulting in a higher pension.  Delude says this provision should also be  extended to women who care for disabled or  elderly persons. The Green Paper supports  the implementation of the child care provision but does not mention the possibility of  extending it.  "Supporting the child care provision is  society saying that we should support this  endeavour because we will all benefit from  it," Townson says. The rest of Canada does  not have the child care provision because  Ontario has effectively vetoed implementation.  Currently, a homemaker who reaches the age  of 65 receives only the old age pension  all Canadians receive. Her husband, if he  has contributed to the C/QPP, will receive  a pension on his retirement. When he dies,  his widow will recieve a widow's pension,  usually 60 per cent of the original pension..  Delude finds the widow's pension an archaic  and discriminatory practice.  . "Widow's pensions treat homemakers as if  they're burdens to the family and not  assets," she said.  "Furthermore, women who are married to richer men will have higher widow's pensions,  and a homemaker who is divorced may not receive any pension at all."  Delude feels Canadian society has two  choices: we can either continue to treat  homemakers as dependents and burdens on the  family or we can recognize them as workers  in their own right and integrate them into  The widow's pension is an  archaic, discriminatory practice.  It treats homemakers as if they  are burdens to the family,  not assets.  "Ontario claims that such a provision subsidizes those women who can afford to leave  the labour force," says Townson. "The real  reason is Ontario is using it as a bargaining ploy to get other changes to the plan -  specifically the right to continue borrowing  from the plan." Ontario has borrowed million!  from CPP and has not paid any of it back.  Should a woman who works in the home as a  homemaker be able to draw a pension from the  C/QPP? Delude says yes; Townson says no.  The CCP Advisory Committee recently endorsed  pensions for homemakers, but Health Minister  Monique Begin said the government does not  intend to introduce such pensions in the neai  future, saying there is no consensus on the  issue and that her priority was to increase  monthly pensions for single women currently  over the age of 65.  the C/QPP.  "There is not a political choice of doing  nothing," she says. Instead she would like  to see a system where homemakers are enrolled in the C/QPP. The wage of the home-  maker would be set at $10,000 - roughly  half of the average Canadian Wage. The main  wage earner in the family (usually the husband) would be required to pay the normal  yearly contribution, but contributions  would be waived for low-income families,  and the system of widow's benefits would be  gradually eliminated over 30 years.  'Townson sees serious flaws in Delude's  position. "That proposal says that women  shouldn't have to be dependent on their  husband's incomes after they become 65 years  old, but it's okay to be dependent prior to  that," she says, and goes on to add that if  women are dependent on their husbands during  their younger years they should be entitled to their husbands' pensions.  =According to Townson, homemakers' pensions  seriously undervalue the work of the woman  who is a homemaker and a wage earner. "All  women do housework," she said. "And in  some households the housework is shared  between children and other adults. The   »  economic value shouldn't be recognized only  for women who stay at home."  .She supports a general increase in all  "C/QPP benefits, including widows' pensions.  The CQPP has been heavily criticized for its  unequal treatment of spouses. When the plan  was first established in 1966 a divorced  woman was not entitled to claim any credits  against her husband's contributions.  The government then amended the plan so that  a divorced woman could apply to split her  husband's pension credits.  If the marriage is still intact upon retirement, splitting pension credits would equalize pensions between the spouses, regardless  if both or only one spouse worked.  In the case where both spouses work, the  credits would be combined and then divided  equally - a recognition that women generally  earn less than men.  The Green Paper favours non-mandatory C/QPP  credit splitting on divorce, death and retirement. However, only three per cent of  divorced women apply for credit splits and  a mandatory splitting of pension,credits  upon divorce, retirement and death appears  more beneficial to women.  The third tier of the pension system is employer provided pension plans, most commonly referred to as private plans.  Townson said the vast majority of women  workers are not covered under any kind of  employer sponsored plan. About 24 per cent  of women work part-time and are not eligible  to participate in employer plans.  Most private plans require an employee to  work for the company for at least ten years,  at which time the employee and employer  contributions are 'vested'. If the employee  leaves the company before the pension  contributions are vested, she will only  get back what she contributed, but not the  monies the employer contributed on her behalf. Since women's careers tend to be  more intermittent than men's, they suffer  most from these restrictions.  The Green Paper suggests a number of reforms to private plans: the shortening of  the vesting period to two years, for example, and the creation of a portable pension  account similar to a Registered Retirement  Savings Plan.  This Registered Pension Account (RPA) would  be a saving vehicle to deposit pension  contributions that would stay with the employee and to which various employers could  contribute. The RPA is locked in until the  age of 65.  Most private plans have an option on payment to the widow of the contributor. F°r  example, a husband, on his retirement, can  opt for high benefits that cease upon his  death or he can opt for lower benefits that  continue after his death.  Townson said this option hurts many widows  who are left without income from the private plan when their husbands die. She favours the implementation of a mandatory  "joint and last survivor pension" provision  which would provide payments while both  spouses live and would continue on the  death of the contributor.  Part-time workers are not left out of the  Green Paper. The reform paper suggests  that workers who meet minimum qualifications of age and work hours should be  covered. For example, if the person is over  25 years old and has worked 600 hours per  year for the previous two years, he or she  would be covered.  Both Townson and Delude concluded, however,  that pension reform for wometf will not be  significantly improved until womens' overall position in the economy is improved.  Until women earn more than 58 cents for  every dollar men earn; until women are not  clustered in low-paying job ghettos and  until women have financial security to  plan So"r their futures, pension reform will  only constitute a bandaid solution. 4 Kinesis May'83  LtLkoor Ndtts  by Marion Pollack  CUPW women victorious  The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (C.U.P.W.)  has advanced union's rights one more step forward.  Several months ago the Canada Post Corporation  sprayed the Vancouver Post Office with the toxic  chemical Diazanon in an attempt to get rid of  paper fleas.  Despite a 24 hour post-spraying period before  people were required to return to work, a number  of pregnant women felt the time was inadequate.  Believing the toxic residue would be hazardous to  their unborn children, they stayed off work one  day and applied for paid leave to cover this absence.  When postal management denied the request the women submitted grievances. The grievances were  initially denied, but management ultimately paid  the women their due.  This is part of a growing trend where women are  demanding employers design workplaces that are  safe for themselves and their unbprn children.  B.C. Nurses challenge Peck  Wage controls and the Provincial Compensation  Stabilization Programme are holding down women's  wages. A recent example involves over 100 nurses,  employed at 13 longterm care facilities, who recently won a contract giving them parity with  nurses in hospitals. This increase amounted to  15.7% over one year, bringing wages up from.$9.09  per hour to $11.64 an hour.  Ed Peck, the highly paid Compensation Stabilization Commissioner rolled this back even though  the B.C. Nurses Union had won an arbitration decision in 1981 stating that nurses in longterm care  facilities were to be paid equally with hospital  Peck's decision is doubtful since wages were settled prior to the wage control legislation. The  contract was not signed until later because of  problems in settling other issues. The B.C.  Nurses's Union has not accepted this decision.  They are taking Peck to court.  More women working  The number of women in the labour force is growing according to the March 1983 issue of the Labour Research Bulletin which states the number of  working women in B.C. rose from 546,000 in 1981  to 559,000 in 1982. On the other hand the amount  of men in the labour force fell from 791,000 to  787,000 in the same periof.  More than one-half of women in B.C. are working,  but most are concentrated in the low paying white  collar sector.  EPIC pickets Army and Navy  The first of two information pickets calling on  Army and Navy to institute equal pay was held at  the Hastings store. It was a resounding success.  The picket centred on the Socred government's continued inaction regarding a complaint filed with  the B.C. Human Rights Branch in February.of.1981  by Beverly Yaworski, a former employee of the store,  That complaint, filed on behalf of every woman who  had worked at the Army and Navy in the past year,  demanded equal pay and back wages. Socred Labour  Minister Bob McClelland has still failed to appoint  a Board of Inquiry in the case.  Leafletters spoke with shoppers, asking them to  sign a petition and to boycott Army and Navy. "We'r<  getting a lot of support," said one picketer. "The  response has been fantastic."  The second picket will be on Saturday, May 7, from  11:30 to 2:30. You are also urged not to shop at  Army and Navy until Yaworski's case is settled,  and to phone Army and Navy management at 682-6644  to tell them why. Women can also write to the Labour Minister, demanding a Board of Inquiry be set  up immediately.  LABOUR  Women  join trek  on Victoria  by Jean Burgess  More than 300,000 B.C. workers are  unemployed. That statistic had 65  visible.faces the week of April 4th  when unemployed men and women took  direct action and, on foot, trekked  20 miles a day down Vancouver Island  to Victoria. There, we were joined by  2,000 people for a march and rally at  the legislature.  Thousands of people saw us. They saw  our faces, our sometimes limping,  sometimes striding pace. People in  cars drove past us honking support;  people in houses came down their  driveways and gave us greetings,  waves, raised fists; one old man digging in his garden gestured in mime  about how the government could put us  to work digging ditches; farm workers  in fields looked up from strawberry  planting; and thousands on the other  side of the T.V. screen and radio  speakers heard our voices as the Island media daily focused at random  on.individuals in the march - their  story, their determination. Like the  old man in his garden we had no illusions about getting jobs by marching  to Victoria and demanding them.  It took those of us from Vancouver  two days to figure out who was making  the decisions on the trek; everyone  but us I Representation came through  the Organizations of Unemployed  Workers in Campbell River, Port Al-  berni and Nanaimo. Our Vancouver contingent had to sort out our representation as we came to trek individually and through two different organizations. The trekkers themselves were  a mixed group- some union members,  some not, men, women, straights, gays,  children, radicals, militants, con-  '  servatives, white, native Indxan,  young, old, Quebecuoise, Europeans  -everything but Socreds. Our basis of  unity - working class people and  out of work, and determined to act.  A few unions had a visible presence  in the march - as trekkers and as  back-up support. Pulp, Paper and  Woodworkers of Canana Local 8  (straight 8); The United Fishermen  and Allied Workers- Union, Nanaimo  local; Service, Office and Retail  Workers Union of Canada; Association  of University and College Employees  in Victoria, and in the end some  International Woodworkers of America  buttons emerged. Why these unions?  We were unemployed union members  and we were used to taking direct  action in our union locals without  requiring some kiss of approval from  higher up. I asked around about what  the status of unemployed union members was within their unions.  For all of us, our unions were planning changes to accomodate and support unemployed members in a way  that did not play them off against  The Malahat Indian Band donated their sacred long-hou  to trekkers  the interests of employed union members. The importance of this alliance  was made clear to us daily as we  marched down the Island Highway talking with each other and 'singing our  songs about conflicts and sellouts  already taking place between workers,  unions and the unemployed. Conside:  the employer getting the union to  agree to a job creation program that  gave some workers short term, low  paying jobs in unsafe working conditions, and for which you earned no  UI contributions. Junk food jobs  say the unemployed; work for the  workers, say the unions, (or is it  dues for the unions?); profits say  the employers.  Hard physical work during the day,  animated conversations, political  education. The evenings were like  trying to sleep on the floor of the  Waldorf beer parlor on a Saturday  night. Sixty-five people in one  room on the floor - camping was  never like this. Some of us comfortably created some women-only space  while still mixing with our fellow  trekkers. Tolerence and mutual respect were fostered from necessity.  The dominant form of interaction -  humour; our sides ached almost as  much as our feet! We were all caricatures for each other; the nurse  who showed up out of nowhere with a  foot fetish and a lamp; the Acadian  who was walking to New Brunswick to  try and save the family farm; there  was "Serge for Tomorrow"; Sam the  Woman of Sarcasm who worked six years  in a pulp mill - which explains her  humour; Vivian, who had-packed her  wayward husband's clothes in two  garbage bags and set them on the  front porch as she left for the  trek. As different and as funny as  we were a link of solidarity grew as  we walked. The Malahat Indian Band  donated their sacred Longhouse to  get us in out of the cold our last  night outside of Victoria, thus  cutting across a century of our racism. Ninety per cent unemployment at  the reserve was no longer just a  statistic.  For us feminism was alive and kicking. In the thirties women were  there in unemployed organizing but  pushed to the sidelines by convention, double standards and the priority given to the struggles of male  workers. The last fifty years we  fought to be in the paid work force  and our gains and very survival are  threatened by this depression.

The grant was  for funds to pay the salary of one full-  time organizer for a year. The City's  Social Planning Department recommended the  approval of the grant and even though a  majority of aldermen supported the request,  we did not get the necessary eight votes.  It is interesting to note that of the 70  community organizations that were recommended to Council for approval of funds,  D.E.R.A. was the only grant request that  was rejected.  Each year D.E.R.A. is put in the position  of having to appeal Council's decision.  Each year we are forced to request support  and help from the community in appealing  the decision. We MUST convince the aldermen, once again, that there is widespread  community support for D.E.R.A.'s work.  The following is a brief summary of services, activities and projects undertaken  by D.E.R.A. since April, 1982. As you can  see, having a full-time organizer has  been crucial to initiating projects, coordinating staff and volunteers, and providing a variety of services to the community .  Daily Advocacy  During the past year, D.E.  R.A. has assisted at least 625 local residents with welfare, housing, pensions,  U.I.C., criminal compensation, family  problems and legal matters. Residents can  get expert advice and representation from  the D.E.R.A. office. This year we have  been busier than ever in representing  people and we have seen an increase in  D.E.R.A.'s presence at Welfare tribunals  and at Rentalsman's hearings.  Housing We have continued to press for  more and better housing in the Downtown  Eastside, as is the D.E.R.A. tradition.  This has included checking hotels and reporting violations of the Standards of  Maintenance By-Law. We have regularly presented reports on hotel conditions to  Council's Standing Committees on Community  Services. Further, D.E.R.A. has been continually urging the provincial government  to proclaim the Residential Tenancy Amendment Act which would give tenancy status  to permanent residents of hotels and rooming houses.  Income Tax Since January, 1983 to the present, D.E.R.A. has filled in approximately  600 income tax returns for local residents.  This year this work has been done entirely  by volunteers as funding was not available  from the federal government. We have also  organized a massive campaign in the form  of a petition demanding the reinstatement  of both the Renters Grant and Personal Tax  Credit. To date we have approximately  4,000 signatures from people throughout the  city.  Mayor's Task Force on Alcohol and Drug  Abuse in the Downtown Eastside  D.E.R.A. is  a member of the Mayor's Task Force which  has been working to eliminate the sale of  alcohol substitutes in the Downtown East-  side, perticularly Lysol and Chinese Cooking wine. At the request of the Police  Department and the Task Force, D.E.R.A.  has taken an active role in monitoring  beer parlours for liquor violations. We  have presented detailed reports to Council,  who have agreed with our recommendations.  Port Master Plan  D.E.R.A. was one of the  founding members of the Vancouver Waterfront coalition - formed as a result of  issues raised by the Port of Vancouver  Master Plan which contains development proposals spanning a period of thirty years.  Today the Coalition has members from 30  trade unions and community organizations  which represent over 20,000 people.  Downtown Homemakers Service  In March, 1982  the Ministry of Health announced that it  would discontinue funding to the Downtown  Homemakers Service. D.E.R.A. called a public  meeting to organize opposition to the government's decision. To date, the Downtown  Homemakers Service is still operating.  D.E.R.A.  Senior Citizens' Club  The D.E.R.A.  Seniors' Club has continued to grow over  the past year. As of March, 1983 the club  has a membership of 1250. Under the coordination of Anna Wong the club sponsors  6 English classes a week with a total of  126 students. The club provides translation, advocacy services and social activities for its members.  Work Projects  Since May, 1982 D.E.R.A. has  developed and successfully carried out  the following projects:  a) Downtown Eastside Survival in the '80's  - a Canada Community Development Project  which researched and publicized the impact  of B.C. Place on the Downtown Eastside.  b) A Hundred Years of Struggle - a Summer  Canada project which researched and wrote  the history of the Downtown Eastside (this  book is being edited and is nearing completion) .  c) The D.E.R.A. Guide - in the summer of  1982 we researched the services available  for residents of the Downtown Eastside  for the purposes of updating our 1978 publication. This research is currently being  compiled and the 'D.E.R.A. Guide* will be  published in the near future.  d) Crime Prevention and Community Safety - a  Canada Community Development project which  is working on several alcohol-related  issues  Volunteers  Approximately 30 volunteers  work from 4 to 40 hours per week for  D.E.R.A. Their invaluable work includes  typing, leafletting, graphics, completing  income tax returns, research and community  work.  In addition DERA has been working to develop a housing site in the Downton Eastside,  researching the impact of B.C. Place and  Expo '86 and has been speaking out at every  opportunity about the massive problems  these projects will create in our community.  DERA's organizer is an executive member of  the Vancouver and District Labour Council's  Unemployed Action Committee and has provided training to the advocates of the  Unemployed Action Centre.  We have been extremely busy. Further, we  will be celebrating the tenth anniversary  of the Downtown Eastside and D.E.R.A. this  summer by organizing a community festival.  By commemorating our tenth anniversary,' we  will not only be celebrating our first  decade as a community, but also, we will  be reminding ourselves of the work that  still needs to be done.  As yet we do not know when"Council will  hear our appeal but we do know that we need  your support now. Please help us by:  • having your organization/group write  a letter of support to the Mayor and Members of Council (453 West 12th Ave., Van.,  v5Y 1V4);  • writing a letter of support yourself, as  an individual; (these letters should state  that you intend to speak at the appeal,  if you will, and that you want to be notified of the date of the appeal)  • coming to City Council when the D.E.R.A.  appeal is heard (call our office for the  exact date and time);  • making a financial contribution to  D.E.R.A. (tax receipts will be issued for  all donations).  Unemployment continued. ——————  in the 80's women are on the front  lines fighting the patriarchy and  the class system.  The women on the trek spoke clearly  and strongly on feminist issues.  Equal pay, single parenting, childcare, the necessity of full time  work, anti-pornography and more were  all part of our discussions. Even  something as small as a call for  "Women and children first" at the  . soup line was answered in humour by  "the hungry and low blood sugar ones  first".  And who did we choose to do the  heavy negotiations with the Federation of Labour representative in  Victoria, when our tenuous alliance  with the Labour Councils was about  to break? Gail, Samantha and Sandy.  •The rallying chant of "What do we  Want? Jobs" was postscrpted "and for  equal pay."  One high for me was when we walked  into Victoria and marched down  Douglas Street chanting "Jobs" and  "Fight". We looked over to the left  and there it was, the Red Hot Video *  Shop. The immediate fury scream of  the trekkers was spontaneous - "Red  Hot Video - Shut Them Down".  I was proud to be on the Victoria  trek. The energy that came from the  solidarity we built with each other  has stayed with me. Being unemployed  is a basis around which to fight  back. There is an Ottawa trek being  planned - by train. We have no details as yet. Are you interested  in being part of it? Our feminist  experience demands that we be part  of leading the fight for full employment.

Relief was used to  manipulate both men and women. Recipients  were often forced to work as strikebreakers,  or be cut off relief payments.  With these kinds of conditions it is little  wonder that hunger marches were organized.  Women were prominent in the marches, with  newspapers paying special attention to the  presence and numbers of women in the numerous 'hunger hikes'. The largest hunger  march in Vancouver took place Feb. 21,  one day prior to the Victoria gathering.  The Vancouver Sun reported that:  ..between five and six thousand men  and women, with a large sprinkling  of children,  took part in the hunger  march Monday afternoon and after meeting at the Powell Street meeting  grounds, marched through the city  streets to Cambie -Street. ..  At the same time, in New Westminster, 50  or 60 marchers, '...including a number of  women' marched through city streets before  boarding trucks to join the Vancouver  march.  The next day, marchers from all over the  province converged on the legislature to  demand action. The Victoria Times noted  that:  ..a number of women marched with their  husbands and there  were groups . of  children with their parents.   Girls  with tin cups ran alongside the  marchers soliciting contributions  from the crowds.  Jenny Shouldice was involved with the  Women's Labor League in Ladysmith when  she took part in the hunger march. She  recalled that the women of the W.L.L.  were union-conscious, and deeply involved  in the province's events.  ..my mother belonged (to the W.L.L.),  so I was totally involved in what they  were doing...A lot of these women then  did participate in this big hunger  march.  It was to get unemployment  insurance so that a depression wouldn 't  hit like it did, without people having  something to fall back on...(the hunger  march) was really quite exciting,  because there was a lot of talk beforehand.  It Was being organized all  through the province because people  cared...It took them days from Port  Alberni  (walking) or other places but  all along the way people had big dinners and a send-off as they passed  through. And there was a tremendous  reception in Victoria - there were  billets and food.  (Fighting for Labour, p.  43)  The result of the hunger march was a promise from Premier Pattullo to implement  unemployment insurance. But it was a  false promise by the province as the  Federal government had already planned  the same thing.  While newspapers tended to treat the hunger marches as instruments of 'socialist'  propaganda, a few supportive voices did  make it into print. Kathleen Norris  joined the marchers, at least in spirit,  from the society pages of the Vancouver  Sun:  ..and if we did have to sacrifice  some of our military preparedness or  even some of our high schools to build  up a stronger and happier nation,  to  fill stomachs instead of minds,  wouldn't it be worthwhile? If thereby  we struck a blow at the very source  of world fear?  It was 1932, the second year of the first  Great Depression and, to some minds, the  worst year. Outside the legislature in  Victoria,'an imposing gathering of the  unemployed' demanded jobs and food. The  marchers had come from all over British  Columbia to demand government intervention to end the Depression. Predominant  among those gathered were women and children.  Inside the legislature, a deputation of  four unemployed men had presented Premier  Pattullo with a list of demands. Now it  was Peggy Harrison's turn. She rose to  deliver the demands of the women and young  persons gathered, outside:  • the immediate closing of all charity  institutions and refuges, as there is too  much inefficiency and the heads of those  institutions are too well paid for the  work they do.  • all young workers to get $12.00 per week  with or without work.  • the right of the unemployed youth to use  Throughout the Depression  women also marched on City  of Vancouver relief offices,  demanding food, electricity,  clothing and medicine.  schools and gymnasiums free of charge.  • that no workers be taken off relief for  refusing to act as strikebreakers.  • transportation to school for children  of the unemployed, one free hot meal at  school each day, free textbooks and  school supplies.  • abolition of cadet instruction, as our  ideal is to send our children to school  to teach them constructive objectives, not  destructive.  • better food for unemployed women, as the  relief handout is"starch in 3 or 4 forms,  and that is no diet for pregnant women.  (Victoria Times, Feb. 23, 1932)  Peggy Harrison and the other women of the  first provincial hunger march were not  alone in their demands for jobs and food.  From Europe of the 16th century to New  France (Quebec) of the 1700's to British  Columbia of the 1930's women periodically  took collective action to force a change  in a starvation situation. Usually the  central issue was lack of food, hoarding  by government officials or dramatic price  increases. In New France in 1758 during a  famine when residents were reduced to 2  ounces of bread each a day, and some were  eating grass, the women of Quebec City  marched to the governor's door to demand  bread. After heated debate, the governor  agreed to increase the bread ration to  one half pound each per day. The women,  knowing full well how governments work,  refused to leave until the governor had  wheat brought from nearby Lachine in order  to fulfill his promise.  Throughout the Depression, women also  marched on City of Vancouver relief offices, demanding food, electricity and  fuel, clothing and medicine. Carrying  children, or banging patched pots and  kettles, women would descend on the council chambers, reminding city officials of  the impact the Depression had on the  majority of Vancouverites.  While women were clearly visible in the  hunger marches, it is unclear whether  they played an organizing role. Given that  most unemployed demonstrations during the  Depression were organized by the male-  dominated Unemployed Worker's Association  and, later, the Relief Camp Worker's Union,  it is likely that women did not play an  integral role in the organizing per se.  The weakening of women's role in organizing collective protest generally has been  linked to the rise of industrial capitalism, and the devaluation of women in both  the work place and the family. Prior to  the development of industrial capitalism  in this country, women's role in the family demanded they organize and conduct  protests against food shortages and prices.  Once women's work was separated between  domestic and waged labour and motherhood  as a career was promoted, women's role  was re-defined within that parameter.  While married women maintained responsibility for food, it was their husband's/  lover's paycheck that secured the food  supply. That shift in emphasis obviously  influenced women's role in popular protest.  The hunger marches ended in 1932, with a  ban on the marches in Vancouver. But today,  when food prices rise, shortages happen or  quality drops, it is often women protesting, demanding change. From the early days  of this country, through the Depression  of the 1930's and into the Depression of  the 1980's, women still demand what they  know is the right of every one - a decent  standard of living.  There is very little information regarding  the- hunger marches of the 1930 's but some  is available in:  Fighting for Labour - Patty Wejr/Howie  Smith  (Sound Heritage,  Victoria)  Recollections of the On-to-Ottawa Trek -  Ronald Liversedge  (McLelland,  Stewart,  Toronto) May'83 Kinesis 7  INTERNATIONAL  Women in Xrrti i_ •        i*  Nicaragua / Their changing lives  Margaret Randall,  author of Sandino 's  Daughters,   is an  American born activist who has been  living and working in  Central America for  several years.  She  and her daughters now  live in Nicaragua.  Vinny Mohr and Gary Cristall interviewed  Margaret Randall in Managua,  Nicaragua on  January 27,   1983 for Vancouver Co-op Radio.  An edited version of the tape is re-printed here.  Q« You have been very much identified with  the story of Latin American women. My impression is that Nicaragua is extraordinary  because of this and also because it is the  least sexist country I have ever seen in  Latin America. I think you notice far less  women in the army now. It is not as obvious  as it was right after the downfall of Somo-  za, however. Could you talk about this and  the general development of the liberation  of women during the revolutionary process.  A. Well, I would say that Nicaragua is not  less sexist than other countries. It's as  sexist as any Latin American country, and  probably as sexist as any country in the  world. What is not sexist here is the  official line of the Sandinista Front for  National Liberation (FSLN) with regard to  women. And those are two very separate  things.  With regard to women in the military,  most of the high level women in the military who were commandantes during the war,  women like Dora Maria Tellez who took the  city of Leon at the end of the war, women  like Monica Baltodano who took the city  of Granada, and so forth, and was part of  the Frente Interno, those women have basically much more important jobs today. They  have high political responsibilities rather  than military responsibilities.  Dora Maria Tellez is the head of the FSLN  in the capital city, aside from being vice-  president of the Council of State which is  her more public job, but her far more important job is her position as head of the  party here in Managua. Monica Baltodano is  responsible for the relationship between  all the mass organizations in the country  and the FSLN, which is an extremely important political position, and so forth and  so oh. There are many women in the army  still...  Q. I was referring more to what you see on  the street level.  A. Many of the women who were involved in  military work are now involved in political work. And I think that has to do with  their sense of wanting to have babies,  their wanting to have a home life, which  they weren't able to have during the war.  In the military here, as long as this  country is in a state of war, which is the  current situation, if you are in the military you have to be on 24 hour call, and  go where, and when and how. I mean you're  under military discipline. And it's still  in a country like Nicaragua where children  are, whether one likes it or not, largely  the responsibility of the mother, unless  you are willing to give up that part of  of your life, which some women are undoubtedly, but not all women. It's hard.  And so, these women have been moved to political positions rather than military positions. At a lower level also, at a street  level also. But an important thing to remember, I think, is that those positions  are more important than the other ones  were. 1 mean, after the triumph of a revolution, there is no doubt that political  decisions are more important than military  positions.  I think that the situation is interesting, in  the sense that the,FSLN has without a doubt  as far as I am concerned, the best line on  women...a line that has been seen to have  been put into effect, it's not just rhetoric...of any revolutionary party or organization on this continent, in power or out  of power. The natural combustion between  that fact and the level of sexism in a country like Nicaragua, the traditional level  of sexism, people's expectations, men's as  well as women's, produces a daily series  of events which are extremely interesting.  And I think it would be interesting if you  could get some of the polemics that have  gone on in the papers about sexism specifically. On the 29th of September of last  year Tomas Borge gave a mind blowing speech  about women, and about sexism specifically.  (This was published on Oct. 4, 1982 in  Barricada.) It was a very self-critical  speech, and it was a very, very important  speech which dealt with areas that many of  us didn't expect to be touched on in this  revolution for 10 or 15 years, such as  women's rights to sexual pleasure and all  kinds of things which one wouldn't assume  that during a war would be touched on by  "Many of the women who were involved in  military work are now involved in political  work. After the triumph of a revolution,  there is no doubt that political decisions  are more important than military positions."  one of the leaders of the revolution...  The result of the speech was that people  started talking all over the country about  these things, and the FSLN asked many people who often write about women, including  myself and other women, and men also, to  try to go deeper in each of these points by  writing for the paper, stimulating again,  a public debate about many of these areas.  And a very explosive debate was developed  in both of the newspapers that are with the  revolution, Barricada and El Neuvo Diario.  You should really look up those things  because some amazingly profound statements  were made and also some very absurd, paternalistic and sexist statements were made,  and some real battles developed.  The most interesting part was that it wasn't  something that remained at a sort of intelligentsia level, people who read the ideological page of the newspaper, but discussion was really promoted in the countryside and among workers, and it's an ongoing  thing, it hasn't stopped, and it's not  something that's going to be taken care of  in a year or five years or ten years. But  I think that the degree of concern about  this, and the degree of activity around it,  and the degree of promotion around this  kind of thing, for a revolution that's not  even four years old, and that's facing the  kinds of things that the Nicaraguan revolution is facing in terms of defence and  production, Is really amazing. It's very  exciting to me.  There's lots of problems, too. I mean  there's the problem of the personal life  of these women who are strong women and  who have assumed amazing responsibilities  for men or women and whose personal life  has suffered a lot as a result of this.  These are all things that people are discussing, and I think the healthiest thing  about the situation is the FSLN and the  revolution feels that these are concerns  which are their responsibility, that  they're not personal problems, that they're  political problems...  Q. Maybe you could give us a general overview. Things obviously happen slowly in  this country. It's so poor and there are  so many things that need to be done. Could  you give us an overview of what in the last  3h years has transpired to improve the  position of women in general, and I am not  thinking necessarily about formal things,  I am talking about the way women live.  A. Well, just the fact that people have human dignity in this country since July 19,  1979 is extremely important. It's more important for women than for men. It's important for the whole population, but since  women always have the short end of dignity,  that would be the first thing I would say.  The women's organization AMNLAE is promoting a number of things. For example, the  discussion of laws being put through the  council of state which have to do with women. That's one thing.  Q. What laws would those be?  A. Well, one which has passed about mothers  5 having rights to their children as well as  § fathers, more rights as a matter of fact.  - And fathers have to support their children.  « It was a terrible thing in this country,  J the degree, the level of father abandon-  *. ment of children was just appalling, it  S  still is. So now that is covered by law,  ■g. which it never was before.  Education, the change in education, the  literacy programme, the follow up campaign  for adult education is for the population  at large, it's not just directed at women,  but it's clearly much more important to  women than to men because women had a much  lower degree of education, and there are  a lot of general programmes that the revolution has going. Although they are not  specifically directed at women, they work  in the sense that they change women's lot  a lot more than they change men's lot because women's lot needs changing more.  A lot of the problems that have been resolved in the big city markets, the five new  markets that have been constructed, has  made a difference in an inumerable number  of women's lives, rather than men's lives.  Why? Because women are mostly the people  who work in the markets. And so forth and  so on.  There's a number of specific particular  programmes aimed at women within that, too.  For example, at prostitutes and at maids.  There's a number of rehabilitation programmes for prostitutes, which are going pretty  well in Leon and Quarinto and here in Managua. It's hard in that respect. Cuba had a  big advantage over Nicaragua which was  that there were jobs available. So when  they trained prostitutes, for example, to  work in other areas, there were jobs to  receive them. In this country there's no  continued on next page 8 Kinesis May'83  INTERNATIONAL  continued from p. 7  jobs, so that kind of problem has to be  handled in a different way here. Women who  were prostitutes are now doing things like,  crafts and so forth which are not as mind  changing, or ideology changing as if they  could go into the salaried labour force.  But, nevertheless, the programmes are  successful.  There is a maids union here, too, which is  extremely important, and which is receiving  a lot of support from the Sandinista trade  union movement as well as from the women's  movement, AMNLAE. It's a very strong union  and it's doing amazing things. One of the  biggest things that it's trying to do is to  get maids to realize their rights. First  of all, it fought for a series of reforms,  legal reforms such as a ten hour day. You  may think that a ten hour day is a terrible  day, but here maids worked a 24 hour day,  so a ten hour day is a big improvement.  A minimum wage, fringe benefits, health  care and so forth. The fact that if you  fire a maid, you have to give a certain  length of time of notice. All these different things like a regular worker, right?  These laws now exist in Nicaragua, and the  Ministry of Labour supports demands around  these grievances.  But, the big task for the maids union is to  get the maids to lose their fear of being  fired, of being trampled on, of being demolished. ..this incredible groveling situation they've been forced into by their  employers... so that they will in fact go  to the Ministry of Labour over these grievances.  Q. What are the laws around abortion in  Nicaragua now?  A. Abortion is illegal still here. And this  is something which is very definitely on  the agenda. It's very definitely going to  have to be changed. It's undoubtedly going  to imply a tremendous struggle here because  of the Catholics, because of the hierarchy  of the Catholic church. It has not been  felt to date that it is.something that we  can launch, but it can't be long in coming  on the other hand because I notice that  recently in the paper there has been some  discussion about abortion in the United  States,different articles, and this is  clearly to pave the way for the initial  discussions, but this is going ,to be something that is going to be very tough here.  But it's got to come, there's no question  about that...  There is illegal abortion, but there's  amazingly little. Mostly, it's just go  ahead and have the baby. The situation is  tempered by the particular situation in  this country which is a) a low population;  b) the fact that after a war, especially  the kind of devastating war that took place  in this country where there were 50,000  dead in a population of less than three  million at that point, the tendency to want  to have children is very high, so that  many people who one would assume because  of their particular situation, either their  work situation or their financial situation,  one would imagine they wouldn't want to  have children, actually try to have children, and have children...  Children are just dearly beloved here and  very much desired by most people, and I  think this has also tempered perhaps the  sense of urgency around abortion. By saying  this however, I do not mean and I do not  want to give the impression that I underestimate the need for legalizing abortion,  or diminish or somehow take importance  away from the fact that it is a very important thing to be legalized. That I am absolutely clear on and the leadership of AMNLAE is clear on it and the FSLN is clear  on it, and it's going to be a struggle.  It's a matter of time and of timing.  Q. How about gay and lesbian rights? Do  they exist? Are there laws against them?  A. There's no laws against them. That's  something that's been quite interesting  and as far as I am concerned, amazing and  very positive in this revolutionary process.  There has been absolutely no discrimination  against gay people at the level of the  FSLN, at the level of the state. It hasn't  been an issue, and I don't know if it ever  will be an issue. I hope it won't, but as  of yet it hasn't been an issue.  Q. Maybe it hasn't been an issue because  so much of the leadership here is a product of the sixties really as opposed to  many of the Cubans who were formed in an  earlier period and other societies that  are non-capitalist societies, revolutionary  societies, where...such as the Bolsheviks  presence certainly isn't very powerful because one never hears about them. There  are other groups of women that are important that are with the revolution aside from  AMNLAE, for example, groups of Christian  women in the base communities who are very  important, university women, groups of  peasant women.  The kinds of women who belong to AMNLAE?  All women, all women who are with the revolution basically belong to AMNLAE. AMNLAE  spent its first year being an organization  along the lines of a mass organization, and  after about two years, a year and a half or  two years, re-evaluated its line and changed  and no longer considers itself a mass organization, but a movement that is present  who were formed in a very peculiar way be  the late Victorian...  A. I think that actually in Nicaragua, the  fact that you just mentioned, which was  that the leadership was formed in the sixties, late fifties, even seventies some of  it, because some of it is very young, is  very important in terms of gay rights, and  it's also important in terms of women. I  think that jthe international consciousness  about women's rights had reached a much  higher level in this country than in a  country like Cuba, for example. Homophobia  in the general population also seems to be  much stronger in Cuba, although it certainly exists here.  I have heard anti-gay remarks by people  here, you know, in the street, but I have  never heard one by a member of the Frente.  In fact I have heard repeatedly by people  in high positions in the Frente being faced with that kind of remark, "Oh, that's  a personal situation, that has nothing to  do with a person's political capacity."  So I find that situation here very, very  pleasing and very moving. I hope that it  remains that way. I have every indication  that it will, but I know that's a complex  thing and I don't want to make any predictions .  Q. Could you give us a general description  of the kinds of women that belong to AMNLAE,  and if there are any other organizations  of women that are opposed to the government  like in Chile?  A. I don't know of any organizations of  women opposed to the revolution, although  I am sure that among the women members,  or the wives I should say, of the MDM and  the social democrats and the different  opposition parties here there certainly  may be, and in the hierarchical church, I  am sure there are women's auxiliary groups  and so forth. I am sure they exist. Their  in all the different mass organizations,  so that one is in AMNLAE because one is a  woman and is with the revolution.  Q. That's very interesting. I think there  has been a general notion in North America,  certainly on the left, where we come from,  where you come from, that an independent  autonomous women's movement is extremely  important, and I think that even goes back  to some phrases by Lenin where at one  point...  A. An autonomous independent women's movement, but not an organization.  Q. How does it work? How does it operate?  A. Well, for example, it used to operate as  an organization where they would recruit  women to be members. Now the idea is "Somos  AMNLAE"—"We're all AMNLAE". We all consider outselves, we women who are with the  revolution consider ourselves AMNLAE. What  do we do? Well, we work around specific  issues, we work around specific problem  areas, we demand and protect the rights of |  women in the army, in the schools, in the  labour force, in the Council of State, we  fight for laws which are beneficial to women and so forth, but we don't stop for  that being worker, peasant, university student.  Q. As a movement, how is it organized?  A. It has a national office, it has regional offices, and it has municipal offices,  but they don't work as organizational  offices, they work as offices of a movement  They have delegates in all these different  places. For example, in the army, in each  army unit that has women in it is a delegate from AMNLAE.  Q. Is that delegate just elected by the wo-|  men who are in that unit and they say "You  are going to be the delegate to AMNLAE"?  -k.  Right.  continued on p. 9 May'83 Kinesis 9  INTERNATIONAL  Mothers of the Disappeared  by Rachel Rocco  Two Salvadorean women, Hilda Diaz and  Laura Pinto began their cross-Canada speaking tour here in Vancouver on April 14, at  a dinner given in their honor by the Interagency Committee for Women and Development.  Diaz and Pinto are in Canada as representatives of the Committee of Mothers of  Political Prisoners and the Disappeared.  "We are not the bearers of good news",  Diaz apologized, "We come to share the  truth with Canadian people about the realities of life in El Salvador". "Since 1979  our country has been in a state of seige,"  explained Pinto, "No one goes out in the  streets after 9 at night."  In the past three years 40,000 Salvadoreans have been murdered by the U.S.-backed government currently in power; 5,000  people have 'disappeared' and there are  at least 800 known political prisoners.  In a country with 60% unemployment, 70%  illiteracy, and 80% malnourished children,  the only aid or sustenence provided by  their government and by the President of  the U.S. takes the form of American assassins, planes, arms, and bodies in the  streets, Pinto said. The people of El  Salvador live in terror with constant  violation of their human rights. Meanwhile, the government of El Salvador and  the U.S. administration tell the world  they must protect the "system of democracy"  that they claim exists in this Central  American country. Diaz and Pinto want Canadians to know what their own experience  has been in this so-called democracy.  Hilda Diaz is 61 years old. She is the mother of nine children. In April of 1980 one  of her sons was assassinated by the National Guard. He was a student at the National  University, which has been closed since  1979. He belonged to the student association  which was actively working to have the University re-opened.  In April of 1981 another of Hilda's sons  disappeared and has not been heard from  since. He was an assistant to an accountant  in a municipal hall. In 1977, when the municipal treasurer claimed to have lost the  pay of the street cleaners and the parks  workers, Hilda's son and other workers  organized a municipal employees union to  put pressure on the treasurer to pay the  employees. He was active in the union.  Last year Hilda lost a third son. He was a  student organizer and activist, working for  the 'just cause', said Hilda. He was assassinated by the police.  "I don't think it's a crime," says Hilda,  "when workers ask for better salaries so  they can live in houses and pay for the  necessities of life. I don't believe it's  a crime when young students ask for lower  tuition fees or the right to study." But in  El Salvador, she says, "one who presents  themselves openly in opposition to the  authorities, demanding legal rights is  branded a communist." All those who fight  for basic human rights in El Salvador merit  this label and become targets of the government's policy of genocide against dissent .  Hilda explained that her story is not the  story of one" mother but of thousands suffering from repression in her country. There  are 400 such mothers in the Committee of  Mothers of Political Prisoners and the Disappeared.     ,:?^>Pits  The mothers in the committee never know  when they leave their houses if they will  come back that night or disappear themselves . "Every day in El Salvador someone  is lost fighting for the liberation of our  country. This only makes us fight harder",  says Pinto. "We as mothers will never be  silenced, for we have lost our children,  relatives and loved ones. We will tell the  world of the injustices that exist in El  Salvador."  The committee was founded in 1977 at the  initiative of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who  was assassinated while giving Mass in 1981.  The committee works to aid political "prisoners and openly denounces human rights violations. In 1978 the committee undertook its  first political action and peacefully occupied the Salvadorean Red Cross, demanding  the release of all political prisoners.  This occupation lasted three months and was  accompanied by a hunger strike. Since 1979  their work has taken a different form since  no occupation or demonstration is tolerated.  Instead, the committee holds press conferences and tries to keep track of political  prisoners and the disappeared.  Earlier this month Melida Anaya Montes, a  fifty-four year old woman and commander  of the Popular Liberation Forces in El Salvador, was attacked and brutally murdered by  a CIA hit squad while in a "safe house" in  Managua, Nicaragua. Pinto told us that the ^  death of Comandante Ana Maria, as she was  g  known, as well as the brutal assassination o  of Marie Elena Garcia, the former president g  of the Salvadorean Human Rights Commission, &  two weeks earlier makes it clear that the  i  people of El Salvador are not simply bat-  ^  tling their own government but U.S. Imper- o  ialism as a whole. .3  Marie Elena Garcia had returned from exile  in Nicaragua to investigate the use of  napalm and phospherous bombs by Salvadorean  military. She was murdered while collecting  data that could have helped to expose the  use of chemical warfare in the country. It  is significant that the Salvadorean military  at first announced she was a foreign journalist in the country, and later claimed that  she was a guerilla leader who was killed in  combat. It was some time before her true  identity as an internationally known figure  working for human rights became known.  Pinto and Diaz are asking Canadians to put  pressure on our government to support negotiations in El Salvador. To date Mexico,  Laura Pinlo (top) and Hilda Diaz represented the Committee  of Mothers of Political Prisoners and the Disappeared.  continued from p. 8  Q. I think on some level it's a question of  semantics in the sense that that seems to  me like an organization if it elects delegates, and it has headquarters.  A. Yes, except it doesn't have...you run  into a problem of duality in a situation  and I know in Cuba - I don't want to keep  making a. comparison with Cuba because it's  in many ways unproductive, and if it hadn t  been for the Cubans there wouldn't be any  other revolution on this continent - but  the fact, for example, in Cuba you often  felt torn between are you going to do voluntary work for the Federation of Cuban  Women (FMC) or are you going to go to your  block committee or are you going to go as  a worker, or are you going to go as a party  member if you were a party member, and putting that extra weight on people, and especially on women who have so much weight  on them anyway, is a little bit difficult  and, I think, counter-productive. I think  that's one of the experiences that has  been picked up on in Nicaragua and it's one  of the reasons that they wanted to try to  go about it in a different way. Certainly  it's an experience which is in a process  of experimentation. I am sure it's going  to have to be polished over the years _  through the actual experience that's gained  here.  Panama, Venezuela, France and Columbia  have declared their support for negotiations.  Pinto told us that the U.S. proposal for an  election in El Salvador is both a sham and  a lie because the popular forces, the  Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR) and  the people's army (FMLN) are not allowed  to participate; hence they are not 'free  elections'. Pinto wonders why, if the  elections held in March of 1982 were such  a tremendous success, the U.S. and Salvadorean officials are proposing another  set of elections for December of this year.  The representatives of the Committee of  Mothers of Political Prisoners and the  Disappeared are asking Canadians to make  an effort to stop U.S. intervention in  Central America. They are also touring  Canada to raise funds for their committee's  projects, one of which is supporting many  of the orphaned children in El Salvador.  These women are not politicians but humanitarians who want to put an end to the bloodshed in their country.

For the stresses that are unavoidable,  there are ways of learning to better cope  with them.  NUTRITION  Valium Withdrawal  This is the second in a two-part series on  Valium and the minor tranquilizers.  The  first part described how Valium is promoted  by the drug industry, why women receive  two-thirds of the prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, and the side effects and  hazards of the drugs.  In this issue, we  will look at withdrawing from Valium and  alternatives to drugs.  by Kristin Penn  Vancouver Women's Health Collective  Withdrawing from Valium or any of the minor  tranquilizers such as Serax, Ativan and  Librium, can be a very frightening and difficult experience. As mentioned in the  last article, Valium can be addictive after  three to four months of,; continuous use -  even at very low doses. Many people who are  currently using Valium may not even know  that they, are addicted because they have  not tried to stop using the drug, and their  prescribing doctor has not warned them of  the possibility of addiction.  Withdrawal symptoms can be mild and short-  lasting or severe and long-lasting, depending on the length of time on the drug and  the dosage, as well as the general level of  health of the person addicted. Some of the  withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, depression, headache, anxiety, restlessness,  irritability, nausea, mental confusion,  muscle twitching, pain, unusual skin sensations and trembling.  It is extremely important not to stop taking the drug suddenly after prolonged and  continuous use. Sudden withdrawal can  cause seizures and can precipitate a psychotic episode.  For some, the withdrawal symptoms may be  severe enough to consider going to a detox  centre. The main problem with detox centres  is that they are geared more to alcohol  users and the staff often do not understand  the different problems experienced by those  withdrawing from Valium. The severe effects  of alcohol withdrawal are usually over in  five or six days because the drug is eliminated from the body relatively quickly,  whereas Valium can take weeks, months, even  years to be completely eliminated from the  body. Consequently, long term Valium users  can experience a reoccurance of withdrawal  symptoms months after stopping the drug  completely. While the withdrawal symptoms  from Valium can be severe and debilitating,  they may appear subtler than alcohol withdrawal and therefore are not taken as seriously by detox staff. Nonetheless, someone  who has been on Valium for a prolonged time  should consider this option, especially if  they have been unsuccessful getting off the  drug on their own.  If you decide to come off drugs on your  own, it is best to set up a withdrawal  schedule for yourself. For example, if you  are taking 40mg of Valium each day, cot  down to 30mg for a week or two, then cut  down to 20mg for another week or two, then  lOmg. These are general guidelines and you  may want to withdraw faster or slower than  this. Your withdrawal programme is individual, based on the length of time on the  drug, the current daily dosage, other drugs  you have been taking, and the general level  of your health. Usually, severe withdrawal  symptoms do not appear until you are down  to the last 5mg or so per day. It is those  last few milligrams that are the most  difficult to stop taking. If you have been  taking valium for over a year and the withdrawal symptoms are severe, you may need to  be in a detox centre.  Withdrawal from the minor tranquilizers can  be very difficult, but there are numerous  ways to help facilitate the detoxification  process' and to help you to stay off drugs  in the future. The following suggestions  are necessarily brief due to the limitations of space in this article, but the  Vancouver Women's Health Collective has  more complete information on all the alternatives mentioned.  LIFE CHANGES  In a study of people on Valium done for the  Federal Department of Health and Welfare  Canada, life change was the single most  important factor that helped people come  off and stay off drugs. Those life changes  included getting out of destructive relationships, changing jobs, going back to  paid work after working in the home, going  back to school, etc.  The degree of stress we experience and our  ability to make changes varies with each  individual depending on many factors, including the resources that are available  to us. The very nature of most of our lives  is stressful and we can never eliminate  all the sources of tension and anxiety.  Given that, it is important to examine and  change those factors in your life that contribute to drug dependency that you have  the power to change.  Counselling or, peer counselling with a  friend can be helpful in sorting out the  necessary changes that you may need to make.  Self-help groups such as Valium Anonymous  are an excellent means of getting support  and exchanging information and experiences  about addiction and withdrawal. The Health  Collective will be starting a self-help  Proper nutrition is a fundamental element  of good health for everyone. When you have  been taking drugs, it is especially important to re-build your body nutritionally,  both to aid in the detoxification process  and as a means of strengthening yourself  to better deal with stress.  There is no single dietary regime that is  good for everyone at all times. What is  important is to determine your individual  needs and eat in a way that is both healthy  and enjoyable for you.  There are, however, numerous food substances ^that are unhealthy for everyone. Some  of these substances actually stimulate the  stress response in the body and over-tax  the organs of detoxification such as the  liver and kidneys. Since these organs are  already under stress by drug use, it is  even more important to eliminate substances  which will aggravate them further. Many of  these unhealthy food products also deplete  the adrenal glands whose healthy functioning is crucial for dealing with stress.  The following should be avoided as much as  possible: white or brown sugar - use honey,  maple syrup or molasses sparingly; caffeine  - avoid coffee, black tea, colas & chocolate; refined or processed foods - white  flour products, canned foods, all foods  that have preservatives, colouring agents,  stabilizers, flavour enhancers or other  chemicals; processed or hydrogenated oils,  margarines, fats from animal sources, fried  foods; salt and alcohol.  Basically, it is best to eat fresh fruits  and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, raw  nuts and seeds, and depending on individual  requirements, some unprocessed dairy products, fish and free range poultry. This  will vary if food allergies are a problem.  Both fasting and raw food diets are powerful methods to help your body detoxify  after you have stopped using drugs. Sometimes, however, going on such a programme  can produce more stress than it eliminates  depending on other factors in your life.  So consider it carefully after researching  the various options. You may also want to  consult a health practitioner such as a  naturopath to help supervise your fast.  Vitamins: Drugs such as Valium deplete the  body of vital nutrients. Vitamin and mineral,  supplements can be an important part of the  programme to rebuild physical and emotional  strength and replenish your body. It is  best, however, not to start randomly taking  large handfuls of supplements without actually assessing your individual needs.  On the whole, everyone who has taken drugs  has a higher than normal need for vitamin  C, as this vitamin aids in"the detoxifying  process and is especially needed in times  of stress. Other anti-stress vitamins and  minerals include the B-complex, calcium,  magnesium, potassium and zinc.  Biokinesiology (muscle testing) is a useful  tool to help determine what supplements  you may need. Hair analysis is'used to determine mineral deficiencies and toxicity.  You might also consider consulting a naturopath, an iridiologist or a herbalist.  ALLERGY TESTING  Often we can pinpoint the sources of our  distress. But for some, there seems to be  no explanation for feeling agitated, depressed, sleepless, fatigued or irritable.  You may be taking tranquilizers, antidepressants or sleeping pills for long periods of time out of desperation, but find  they really offer no relief from these symptoms. If distressing mental moods are persistent and inexplicable, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to foods or  environmental substances. As our environment: May'83 Kinesis 11  HEALTH  becomes increasingly polluted, more and more  people are developing debilitating allergies  which may manifest as mental or physical  symptoms. If you suspect you may be experiencing allergies, you can be tested sub-  lingually (under the tongue) by a clinical  ecologist. The traditional skin tests are  not adequately accurate. Biokinesiology can  also be used to determine allergies. In  addition, there are methods that you can  use to test yourself.  RELAXATION TECHNIQUES  When coming off tranquilizers, it is essential to have an alternative method of coping  with anxiety and stress. Even at the best of  times most of us are in a chronic state of  tension due to living in such a high-stress  society.  Learning a systematic relaxation technique  such as autogenic training or progressive  relaxation can be a valuable alternative  to drugs. When used every day, both of  these practices can help relieve anxiety,  depression, irritability, insomnia as well  as stress-related health problems such as  migrane headaches, high blood1 pressure and  other ailments.  If you are currently on drugs, the best  time to learn a relaxation method is before  you start the withdrawal process. When you  are actually experiencing withdrawal symptoms, your anxiety level may be too high to  be able to relax sufficiently to learn the  technique. If you are already off drugs,  learning one of these methods can help you  to stay off permanently.  EXERCISE  You may become agitated, restless and irritable when coming off drugs. This is not only  due to the chemical withdrawal, but also  involves the release of physical energy  that has been suppressed by the drug. You  may feel fatigue due to lack of sleep, or  a combination of agitation and fatigue.  Physical exercise during the day is a valuable way to release excess tension that  can relieve some of the agitation as well  as help you to sleep at night.  For many, vigorous activity such as aerobic  classes, jogging, swimming, etc. may be  needed. This kind of exercise is good both  for the release of muscular tension as well  as for the release of anger that may surface after coming off tranquilizers. Fast  paced aerobic exercise, however, is very  over-emphasized in our culture. The gentle  stretching of yoga and the relaxed movements of tai chi are also excellent forms  of exercise. Both yoga and tai chi are  complete systems of exercise which stimulate  not only the muscles and joints, but the  internal organs and the cardiovascular  system.  Walking is another undervalued but extremely  good form of exercise. Each person must find  the style of exercise which is right for  them and incorporate it regularly in their  daily lives.  VISUALIZATION AND AFFIRMATIONS  Visualization is the use of mental imagery  to effect positive changes within ourselves.  It can be'used in a problem solving way to  determine why you are using drugs and to  explore what you need to do to stop taking  them. It can also be used as a way of reinforcing a positive image of yourself as  someone who does not need drugs.  For example, after going into a relaxed  and receptive state through using a relaxation technique or deep breathing, you can  imagine yourself in a situation where you  would normally feel anxious and upset.  Instead, envision yourself being calm, relaxed and in control of yourself in the  situation.  You can also use affirmations - positive  statements - that you say to yourself to  reinforce the mentab imagery.  It is advisable to .read one of the various  books on visualization before beginning a  programme as there are certain - guidelines  that are useful to follow.   BACH FLOWER REMEDIES  Bach flower remedies are very diluted flower  essences that are useful for mental states  such as fear, depression, despair, anxiety,  indecision, loneliness, self-doubt and  others. They were developed about forty  years ago by Dr. Edward Bach, a British  physician, who believed that in order to  be healthy, we have to work through the  personality to change negative mental  states and become more attuned to our  spiritual nature.  While the 38 remedies are a definite alternative to the minor tranquilizers, they work  on a subtle energy level and do not have  the immediate effect that drugs have. The  well-known Rescue Remedy, which is useful  for any kind of physical or emotional crisis,  is helpful when going through drug withdrawal, but would probably not alleviate  all withdrawal symptoms. You can determine  the remedy you need by consulting one of  the books on the subject or you can go to  a health practitioner who is familiar with  them. The remedies are available at Folklore  Herbs in Vancouver.  HOMEOPATHY  Homeopathy is a complete system of healing  which has been used successfully be people  coming off the minor tranquilizers. It does  not treat symptoms per se, but rather considers symptoms to be signs of the body's  attempt to heal itself. It is a systematic  method of treatment which seeks to stimulate the body's vital force and ability  for self-healing.  Homeopathy is based on the "Law of Similars", that is, a substance which produces  symptoms in a healthy person cures those  same symptoms in a sick person. The remedies are given in extremely diluted form  and prepared in a special process of systematic shaking called succussion.  Constitutional homeopathy differs greatly  from the use of symptomatic homeopathic  remedies that are now commonly sold in  the health food stores. The homeopath does  not prescribe a remedy for the symptom,  but rather takes an extensive history and  prescribes for the individual taking into  consideration physical, mental and emotional factors. Homeopathic treatment is a big  committment as the process can take months  or years to complete.  During the initial course of treatment you  may not be able to have any other types of  treatments, such as chiropractic, mega-  vitamins, etc. Some homeopaths require  that you be drug-free before beginning  treatment, while others will begin treatment while you are still taking them and  expect that after the first remedy you  will lose your desire to take the drug.  HERBS  There are numerous herbs that have calming  qualities that can be used during the  withdrawal process and afterwards. A useful combination is equal portions of  valerian, spearmint and chamomile. Other  combinations such as valerian, scullcap,  wood betony and blue verbain are especially  useful for insomnia.  The effects of herbs are more subtle than  drugs, so do not expect to switch from  Valium to valerian tea without experiencing  any withdrawal discomfort if you have used  drugs for a long time. While the effects  of herbs are more subtle than drugs, they  can still be very potent substances so it  is important to use them wisely and not  become dependent on them.  While all the preceeding suggestions are  for individual changes that are useful to  become drug-free, it is also important to  remember that Valium addiction is not  simply an individual problem. We need to  understand both the societal reasons for  the over-use of tranquilizers by women  (as outlined in last month's issue) as  well as knowing what kind of positive  changes we as individual women need to  make in our lives.  The struggle to overcome tranquilizer dependency is a difficult one but there are  many ways to help ourselves and each other  in that task.  On a political level, we need to expose  the pharmaceutical companies that profit  from our tranquilization and to confront  the doctors who over-prescribe the drugs.  On a personal level, we need to give each  other support and encouragement to make  the necessary changes to. live healthier,  drug-free lives.

The 'Playboy Olympics', it was called. Readers were' treated' to a display of  crotch and tit shots as various Playmates  competed in pseudo-sports for the camera:  That Playboy  feature is only the softcore  pornography end of a recent trend in media  sexploitation - sports. Examples abound.  A recent issue of Fairway,  a golfer's magazine, featured the leading women professional golfers 'at home', which to the  editors meant in their bedrooms. A poster  of LPGA golfer Jan Stephenson, skirts billowing, leaning on a golf club, is caption-  >»i ed, 'play a round with me' .  /71The cheesecake portrayal of women athletes  pis by no means confined to the sports pages.  What Playboy  picked up on is a widespread  phenomenon fostered by the fitness boom  [and exacerbated by numerous sports publications.  Part of the reason is clearly the increasing presence of women in the sports milieu.  For a long time, women were noticeable  only by their absence from athletic news.  Betty Baxter of the Canadian Association  for the Advancement of Women and Sport  (CAAW&S), points out that "The Sun  can do  that, (run those sorts of articles about  women), because there is some consciousness  that women do sports, that they belong on  the sports^ page. They do have articles on  women now, so it's a relatively small step  Keeping tabs on the media  by Emma Kivisild  "If we only fight pornography, we'll settle  for daily sexism, and we'll never get rid  of porn if we don't make connections between the two." That statement comes from  Sylvia Spring, founding member of Media  Watch, a group whose mandate is to get rid  of daily sexism.  Media Watch is a nation-wide organization  devoted to educating and encouraging women to speak out against sexism in the  media. The importance of their work was  recently recognized by the federal government. After two years as a subcommittee of  the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, with an annual budget of  $2000(enough to print complaint forms and  cover some postage), the group recently  received funding from the Secretary of  State Women's Program: $50,000 contracted  between now and July. There is an application for further funding in the works.  The initial funding has gone towards the  establishment of an office.that can serve  as a resource centre, staffed by a full-  time and a part-time coordinator. The  money will also pay for new complaint  forms and contribute to organizing an  educational program on sexism and sex-role  stereotyping in the media.  "We are trying to figure out ways to  reach the women who would never call themselves feminists, but who are offended and  are angry at the way women are presented.  They need to realize that it is an insult  to their human rights, and that they can  do something."  !vVv^T  Towards this end, Media Watch proposes  various programs in the community: the  provision of effective vehicles to combat  offensive materials (complaint forms,  monitoring handbooks, suggestions for  personal and collective actions, and information on extant codes and regulations);  speakers who can address the issue with  community groups; and on educational in  formation kit, for example. Though lobbying  is part of Media Watch's overall methodology, they are not primarily a lobby group.  Rather they encourage women to protest on  their own, usually by lodging formal complaints.  Media Watch has long kept close tabs on  the effectiveness and implementation of  federal guidelines regarding sex-role  stereotyping in the media, specifically  around Pay-TV. They have intervened twice  - at the Pay-TV hearings in Ottawa in 1981,  and the BC Pay-TV hearings late last year.  On those occasions they stressed the importance of following the still underpub-  licized recommendations of the CRTC Task  Force on Sex Role Stereotyping.  The failure of the CRTC to act on those  recommendations, and the consequent advent of pornographic television in the  form of Playboy TV, was a blow to women  who had been working on the issue. It .  served to emphasize the necessity of continued pressure on the mainstream media.  Sylvia Spring sees the role of Media Watch  as making the 'spectral' connections,  pointing out that sexism that is not explicitly violent is nonetheless part of  the same spectrum that includes hardcore  pornography. "It's the insidious stuff  that requires constant vigilance," she  says, "and the industry counts on us to  respond."  This is especially true now, when the  broadcast media is in a two-year trial  period of self-regulation. Women must be  prepared at the end of that period to  present evidence on the success or failure  or self-regulation, and make clear the  fact that the public is aware and does  care about sexist programming.  You can reach Media Watch at their new  office - #209 - 636 W. Broadway  Vancouver, B.C. V5Z 1G2  Ph: 873-8511  to have women in leotards, talking about  losing weight."  Women athletes are also threatening - too  much so.  As Baxter notes, "The closer they can make  an athlete fit the advertising image of  women, the less respect they give her, and  the easier it is to deny that any of those  athletes are actually achieving, skilled  competitors.  It's almost a backlash. More women are interested in sports now, and how can men  still see them in a controlled atmosphere?  By making sport fashion, making it ultra-  feminine."  Sometimes the exploitation is far from  subtle - take Sports Illustrated's Swim- •  suit Issue, for example. Sometimes it is  harder to detect. Baxter points out that  the pictures taken of women athletes in  action tend to stress some aspects of the  game over others.  "The photos chosen of men are usually action  ,shots - crossing the finish line, making a  basket, that sort of thing. For women it's  the hug at the end of the race. But both  men and women athletes do all those things.  It's the media that's choosing those photos.  Baxter goes on to point out that becc'.use  they offer convenient vehicles,,sport and  sport imagery are being used by pornographers. "It gives rise to stuff like the  Playboy  issue, and wet T-shirt contests,  for instance, that we're supposed to be  able to laugh at. Of course no one can say  it's pornography, because it's sport, and  everyone know sport is fun  Baxter stresses that media exploitation  adds to the already substantial list of  obstacles facing feminist sportswomen.  "As we are making the playing fields more  accessible to women, Playboy is just making  them another place to exploit and degrade  women. We as feminists are trying to get  women out there for a sense of power and  well-being, and it is being reduced to another aspect of the pressure put on them to  Of course no one can say it's  pornography because it's sport,  and everyone knows sport is fun.  be perfect - have the beautiful body, with  just the right contours.  "The fitness movement is_ positive in many  ways," she says. "A lot of women who weren't  active before are active now, but we have to  give women information around sport so they  know what they are choosing, and why." The  situation is not entirely hopeless. "There  has been progress with the media, and some  of the coverage is very, very good."  CAAW&S has begun to put together a media  kit on sports women, the object of which  is to make non-sexist images of women athletes available to publications, and thereby force them to improve their coverage.  The group is also organizing series of presentations to provincial fitness leaders to  bring the range of athletics options for  women to the fore.  All women should be aware of the pervasive  adoption of exploitative sports imagery.  Women who we would otherwise respect for  their strength are repeatedly being presented to us as having submitted to all the  trammels of the patriarchy. Wearing a jersey  or a leotard doesn't make objectification  either healthy or fun. prostitutes  May'83 Kinesis 13  •     •     •  an end to the invisibility  by Kinesis staffwriters \  Perhaps one of the most disturbing comments  to find its way into the opinion pages of  the Sun appears on Saturday, April 30 in a  letter from a concerned West End resident,  Marie Hietakangas. In her response to Jill-  ian Ridington's call for decrimilization of  prostitution she says, "Ridington can see  here and now the effects of decriminalization: a neighbourhood under seige. We long  ago lost the right to walk our streets after 7 p.m. We are harassed daily by cruising Johns, who mistake all pedestrians for  prostitutes, and by the prostitutes, who  feel we have no right.to be here...A child  is raped on her way home from school...We  must walk blocks out of our way to avoid  confrontation...We are the victims, and  our neighbourhood is being destroyed."  Yes, for Marie and the Concerned Residents  of the West End (CROWE), a group currently  lobbying the federal government for increased legislation controlling prostitution, real problems are evident in their  neighbourhood. What is disturbing in the  arguments used to promote greater legal  penalties on the street prostitute, however,  is simply that they serve only to scapegoat the female streetwalker for a host of  ills for which "she is not responsible.  West End residents working primarily to  make prostitution invisible, seem to believe that in doing so, this invisibility  will extend to the erradication of sexual  harassment, rape, child abuse, and general  noise and nuisance problems.  For West End residents and other citizens  feeling the very real effects of urban disintegration in the midst of an economic  crisis, the prostitute is a convenient target. For Mayor Harcourt and Alderman May  Brown, who are currently picking up on  these people's concerns, the prostitute  is a timely political vehicle. It is obvious that criminal sanctions placed on the  individual prostitute will not even begin  to alleviate the critical lack of safety  for women and children in our neighbourhoods, let alone address the issue of 'prostitution' itself. Nonetheless, these politicians insist upon pressing ahead to garner votes from a constituency clearly  shocked and outraged at the violence and  sexual exploitation concentrated on their  streets.  Prostitution is a difficult issue: it affects all of us in a deeply personal way  by laying bare the foundations of sexual  power and barter in our society. To seriously take on the issue, is to confront  the severe economic oppression of women  and young people, society's attitudes toward 'so-called' promiscious women, child  neglect and abuse, general police harassment, society's indifference toward rape  and wife battering (especially the violence  done to independent women), and the overall daily exploitation of sexuality for  profit which is a cornerstone of a free-  market economy functioning for the sole  benefit of men.  Little wonder Harcourt and Brown's solutions embrace the simplistic.  Not surprisingly, feminists who have dared  to speak out in support of prostitutes have  come under attack on many fronts, not the  least of which is a seeming inconsistency  between their stand on pronography and  their stand against criminal sanctions for  prostitutes. Marie's letter to the Sun  also' states: "The National Action Committee  on the Status of Women takes great offence  at pornography, but supports the right of  some to act out explicitly on our streets  and at the entrances to our homes what  they find degrading and morally offensive  on film and in magazines." But of course,  there is no real inconsistency between  these two positions. Pimps and Johns are to  prostitution what pornographers are to  pornography. Further, it is clear to feminists working on the issues, that society  is wholly responsible for the creation of  both the market for prostitution and the  glaring lack of opportunity which makes  that market an avenue for women seeking  some means of survival for themselves and,  in many cases, their children.  The real hypocrisy is found in the defenders of sexual mores who tolerate and condone third party observation, recordings,  and sales from sexual degradation of women for male profit, while slapping legal  penalties on women who directly sell their  sexual services. Their idea is not to rid  society of its abusive and degrading attitudes toward women, rather, it is simply  to remove the up-front barter and all its  consequences from the public eye while  punishing those women who have seen through  the thinly disguised relation between a  woman's sexual availability and her monetary worth, and who are prepared to act on  that knowledge.  It is this social and physical punishment  of prostitutes that makes prostitution a  crucial issue for feminists. While it is  true that the situation in Vancouver has  been brought to a confrontation in recent  months, the local debate serves to primarily underscore a much larger feminist concern which is that prostitutes bear the  brunt of-woman as offender, woman as evil,  woman as object to be simultaneously used  and loathed. The women's movement as a  whole has been slow to act on behalf of  prostitutes and in this has left a gap that  can no longer go unnoticed. We cannot  effectively deal with sexuality, abuse of  women, and the economics of women's lot  generally without developing a strategy  to deal with prostitution and the problems  prostitutes face.  It is questionable whether a viable strategy can be formulated without the direct  input of prostitutes themselves. Feminists  and prostitutes have yet to establish a  clear channel of communication for a number  of reasons. Certainly prostitutes themselves are wary of "straight women" and of  being treated in a patronizing or moralizing manner. Neither do they wish to be  seen as hapless victims in need of some  form of feminist rescue.  Feminists, on the other hand, are without  first-hand knowledge of the street, something which makes working with prostitutes  somewhat intimidating. Furthermore, the  voluntary commoditization of women that is  prostitution, is no less disturbing for  feminists than it is for other members of  "straight" society, albeit for different  reasons.  Prostitutes in Vancouver have begun to  organize. The Alliance for the Safety of  Prostitutes (ASP) joins a growing list of  prostitutes advocacy groups in North America. The demands they are making warrant  study on the part of feminists concerned  with taking action on prostitution. ASP's  overriding mandate (and it has been a prime  concern of prostitutes' groups since the  formation of COYOTE in San Francisco more  than 10 years ago) is the decriminalization  of prostitution. Decriminalization is often  confused with legalization, the former being the eradication of all laws that deal  with prostitution, the latter removing the  illegality of soliciting, but leaving laws  in place to govern its practice. What makes  legalization undesirable is that it makes  the government the pimp.  Where prostitution has been legalized it  has resulted in forced brothelization and  futher ghettoization of prostitutes, (see  P. 14)  Decriminalization, however, is far from  the complete answer. While it would mean  that a judge could not sleep with a woman  by night and sentence her by day, there is  little reason to assume that prostitutes  would have any more control over their  working situation than they do now. Until  the focus is taken off the prostitute and  is put on the customer, until a prostitute  has a chance of being believed when she  charges someone with sexual assault or  battering, decriminalization will remain  a desirable step but an incomplete solution.  The question of what kind of long-term  goals we have regarding prostitution is a  very real one and probably the most problematic for feminists. Regardless of whether  or not we support prostitution in the long  run, however, we can be clear that we support the prostitutes.  photo by Claudia MacDonald 14 Kinesis May'83  May '83 Kinesis 15  by Cole Dudley  Prior to the demonstration at City Hall  by Vancouver prostitutes,  Kinesis interviewed Sally De Quadros and Marie Arring-  ton,  members of the Alliance for the Safety  of Prostitutes  (ASP) who initiated the organization of the demonstration.  KINESIS: How and when was ASP formed?  ASP: Around the beginning of 1982 the Concerned Residents of the West End (CROWE)  had a conference on prostitution. Out of  this conference a few women decided to form  a prostitutes support group.  K: Did the meeting consist of the residents  as well as the prostitutes who worked in  the area?  A: No, they didn't invite any prostitutes,  but we went anyway. After our initial contact at this meeting, we were invited to a  group that met every week at Carnegie Centre. We dropped out of that group because  we didn't like the attitudes of the white,  middle class women. So, a number of women  who had been to the Carnegie meetings but  who wanted to talk to and support prostitutes re-grouped and called itself ASP.  Both of us were involved with Rape Relief  and had been talking for months and years  about getting togther and doing street  strolls.  K: What are street strolls?  A: Twice a week we go out into the street  and talk to the women on the street; grass-  root organizing. We talk to them about  what is happening on the street, any bad  tricks they have had, safety strategies  and any measures they may need. We also  talk about police harassment and what the  women would like to see us doing in their  name. We see what contacts we can set up  with the women and also disbribute "bad  trick" sheets. These sheets are descriptions of any violent or abusive customers  the women may have. We take their information, reproduce it onto sheets, and pass  these sheets around to emergency services,  youth workers at Carnegie, the police and  to the women on the street. We also have  done some postings of the sheets on Granville.  involved with ASP  K: How many women <  now?  A: Just the two of us. The rest of the women have left; our analysis wasn't the same.  Within the group we were having great class  struggles - about how to organize the women  on the street. Some of the women who left  wanted to pressure the hookers to get off  the streets because it was dangerous. The  hookers know it's dangerous but they have  no other viable options. Welfare and wait-  ressing are not viable options. We felt  that we had no business arguing with hookers to get off the street unless we put our  money where our mouth is or provide alternatives .  K: Do'you want ASP to grow and include  prostitutes and do you contact them and encourage them to join the organization?  A: We have an action coming up next week -  marching on City Hall. The West End prosti-  The Alliance for the Safety of Prostitutes  tutes have been organizing it and doing a  lot of the work. They're organizing the  safety committee and making the placards.  We also did an action at the Lone Star  Hotel. They were putting on a "Hooker's  Ball" - a satire in which you came as  your favourite fantasy pimp or hooker.  Actually, they were making fun of the women. We organized a demonstration in front  of the hotel with about 40 women.  K: How do you go about contacting prostitutes?  A: It took us months. Because we are of the  street and can handle the language, We  were able to make contact with the women.  We know what the language is like on the  street. You have to be a little thick-  skinned and you can't jump in and say,  "excuse me but that is a misogynist word".  What they're going to do is come down on  your head. It's a very slow process to get  to know the women there. It's a lot of  work - pounding the pavement and gritting  your teeth because the language is atrocious. It's hard if you have any kind of a  feminist analysis. But you want to organize these women and you want them to organize themselves.  You can't go in there and start making  statements that this is wrong or that is  wrong and this is how to do it. They won't  take it.  K: After seven months of organizing, there  are still just the two of you. Are the prostitutes reluctant to join?  A: They're not reluctant.  A lot of women  are talking about joining now. We had to  prove ourselves, though. We had to prove  that we were serious and that we were for  the '  There's also a time element. A lot of them  have kids and have to work. They don't have  as much time as we do. They are helping  now by handing out bad trick sheets, making  placards and donations. You know, we get  donations from women on the street but we  don't get any from squares (straight  people). We got one for $75, an ongoing  pledge, but that's all.  K: What do prostitutes want?  A: They want to be free of police harassment. They want their rights as humans and  they want to be equal. They want the right  to work with safe working conditions. It  takes hours sometimes to psyche themselves  up for work. None of them likes it. If  they could find a job that paid them well,  . what they could live on, they would do it.  They don't like this work, contrary to popular belief. They want the same rights and  protections that other people have and  they're not getting it now. They suffer  violence from the tricks and when they complain to the police, they are not taken  seriously". They are beaten and harassed by  the police and the Johns, and fucked by  both as well.  Prostitutes want to be able to work with a  minimum amount of privacy and a little bit  of respect in spite of what they do, or  because of what they have to do, to survive.  Many of these women have a very good analysis of prostitution.  K: How did ASP develop its feminist analysis?  A: (Marie) My analysis of prostitution has  come from personal experience and putting  it together with the feminist analysis that  I have learned through the years, in other  women's groups and through the civil rights  movement. Most of my analysis of the world  in general came from civil rights, my expert  ience from living in the ghettoes in the  US and Malcolm X.  (Sally) In my kind of space I haven't had  as much experience or much contact with a  feminist group - Rape Relief was my one and  only. I was too busy trying to survive for  18 years with my kids and hooking. Most of  my analysis comes from experience on the  street.  K: Do the prostitutes who have not developed a feminist analysis also support your  position?  A: Sure. We haven't had any great difficulties with the women not agreeing or agreeing  with us. I am very excited about how the  women are starting to organize themselves  - which is the main idea of the work we  do. A lot of the women were opting for  legalization when we first started going  because they didn't know the difference  between legalization and decriminalization. Now you hear the women on the street  speaking more and more about decriminalization.  K: What is ASP's position on decriminalization vs. legalization?  A: Well, if the amendments to the criminal  code go through, we see it as a prelude  towards legalization. You've heard Svend  Robinson proposing a "red light" area. Well,  that's legalization, that's ghettoizing women in one area like an industrial zone. We  have found that this doesn't work.  The Mustang Ranch in Arizona is an example  of prostitution legalized by the state -  where the state is the pimp, in fact. The  women work from 12 to 18 hours a day and in  that time they turn as many as 20 to 60  tricks. They get 30% of the base rate, which  is $20.00, and out of that 30% the IRS takes  a third. They also have to pay for their own  •towels and room and board out of the rest.  The women are not allowed to leave the compound for three weeks (they must stay there  a minimum of three weeks). They cannot go  into town for lunch even - they are virtual  prisoners. They do not have the right to  refuse a trick, they have to take anyone  who walks through the door and they can't  wear safes. They also have to sleep in the  same beds they trick in. This is an example  of legalized prostitution where the men  have the control.  K: Is it your opinion that there is no way  for legalization to work without these sort .  of conditions?  A: No, as long as men are in control and  women have absolutely no control over how  they are working or how they can refuse to  take a man or work their own hours or set  up their own houses, or collectives like  the English and French, then there is no  way legalization can work.  Women who are forced into prostitution because of lack of alternatives, which most  women are, want prostitution recognized as  a profession. We see decriminalization as  giving women control. They would have control over their working hours, working conditions and working places. There wouldn't  be street prostitution if it were decriminalized. The women could form collectives,  rent a house, apply for a bawdy house license and pay taxes on that instead of individual licensing which marks you as a whore.  This is what is happening to women in Germany. It's legalized and they have to carry  their little ID cards but they can only go  into areas they are designated in.  As long as the government or some man in  any way, shape or form has that control,  the .women do not have the power to work the  way they want to work, or it ends up abusive. If it's legalized, the government becomes the pimp. It's an economic thing for  them. They're making a pile off these women now, and if it's legalized they stand  to make a lot more.  Kinesis had an opportunity to talk with  some prostitutes at the April 20 demonstration.  The following is an excerpt from  one woman's story.  "I am eighteen years old and have been  hooking for eight months. Welfare cut me  off because I wouldn't go back to school.  I couldn't go back to school because I had  to work to pay the rent. Just recently  there have been a lot of new faces on the  street...girls 13 and 14 and one even as  young as 9.  With the younger girls coming down, there  are a lot more perverts around and much  more violence. Two people have been killed  by tricks since I've worked the streets.  They (the tricks) seem like regular people when you first meet them. Then when  they get you to a room or a car, they  freak out. I report any bad tricks to ASP  and the police. The bad trick list put out  by ASP does help. If you recognize a man's  description from the sheet, you don't  even talk to him. It helps keep you out  of a bad situation.  I am at this demonstration because I want  a stop to police harassment and I want  to see more training schools and job  placement programs instead of higher fines.  We don't want fines and jailings. That  doesn't stop anything - you just have to  go right back to the street to pay for  the fines."  K: Do you think that legalization will increase the amount of abuse prostitutes  receive from the police and their clients?  A: Of course it will. They will be put away,  invisible, and no one will know about them.  People do not want to look, see or watch  prostitution. They'll tolerate it as long  as it's invisible, essentially ghettoizing  prostitutes in one little area.  If the amendments are passed, women will  have to go underground because they will  have virtually no access to the law at all.  The violence will get worse and the underground world is going to get involved. You  won't be able to work without a pimp or  some man controlling you for protection.  K: TJo you see bawdy houses as viable alternatives?  A: We are in favour of bawdy houses as  long as they are run and controlled by women. We don't want prostitution controlled  by men because it becomes a business, like  porn. We see porn as the printed end of  prostitution.  We don't see prostitution ending as long as  the society is the way it is, with no economic opportunities for women. Until we live  in an egalitarian society there is going  to be prostitution. What we want now is  control of prostitution in the hands of women themselves, not-making big bucks for  the men.  K: Could you describe the situations in  England and France?  A: Well, it's not decriminalized or legalized, it's tolerated more so than here.  They have health cards and ID cards but it's  controlled more. Politicians here are always using that toleration as an example of  how sophisticated the European method is.  Well, it's not. We've heard, from Germany,  England, France and Japan. In Germany, a  neighbour can call the police and say you  are keeping odd hours and have you trucked  off to a red light district. So, you are  then moved into a red light district on the ■§]  suspicion of being a prostitute.  K: What's ASP's position on child prostitution?  A: We think that child prostitution should  be called what it actually is - child sexual abuse and exploitation. It should not  be on the criminal record, it should be  under the child protection act. Right now,  on the streets, men are coming down and  buying these children. But it is the kids  who are being picked up, put into group  homes or locked up, and then turned out  again. The system should address what is  happening to these children, why they are  out there and what kind of alternatives  they have. Those kids are out there for a  reason.  They should arrest the men that use them.  No.more excuses about them looking 19 or  excusing themselves because, after all,  she was selling. We see old men out there -  all the time buying these kids and we harass  the hell out of them, and so do the other  women who are working on the street. They  kick the children off all the time.  K: How do the women feel about the children  being there?  A: It's horrible. They would like to see the  government do something, like providing  alternatives. It's sad for them because  most of them were children when they turned  out. And they don't want to see the cycle  keep going.  Last year a juvenile, 14 years old, was  picked up in a hotel. She was with a trick.  They carted her off and charged her with  keeping a bawdy house, but nothing happened  to the trick. Another example was the 15  year old who fell to her death. The police .  came into her apartment and found her naked  with a trick. She tried to escape the police  by climbing out onto her balcony but slipped  and fell. Even though the trick said it was  the. second time he had seen her and the police said she looked 14, nothing happened  to him. In fact CKVU interviewed him. He  said he felt sad but not guilty,' after all  she was selling. He was not charged, a good  upstanding union member.  Now, if the police said she looked 14, I  don't care what business she's in or how  she has to survive...that is a child and  you should not get away with abus.ing children. They have laws to protect kids but  they are not enforced, and there just aren't  any adequate facilities for children. There  are group homes, like the Senator downtown,  which in theory are great but in practise  are not working. The workers have taken  child ca  and walking into her bedroom. She went to  her social worker to complain but her complaints were not taken seriously. She was  accused of either overreacting or exaggerating. No one believes her because, after all.  she's just street.  In places like the Senator they can come  and go as they please. The kids can leave  for five days and when they come back their  bed is still there. The kids themselves say  that there aren't enough rules. They want  someone to kick their ass, kick them off  the street. They want rules and someone  to care.  K: What do you think must.happen to get  a dialogue happening between the women on  the street and feminist groups?.  A: We think that has to start as an education and we think we can provide the means  for feminists to educate themselves and  each other, about the reality of the women working on the street. Having an analysis of violence against women and sexism  is not enough. There has to be more; there  has to be an understanding of their situation, a concrete analysis to include these  women into feminism. They.are very sensitive to the moralizing, judgemental, and  patronizing attitudes.  K: There are some feminists who are working along the same lines. Do you think the  two groups can work together?  A: They are saying the same things but they  are not asking the prostitutes for their  input. They speak from a white, middle-  class, educated background.  One of the things we want to do is to organize a social, educational evening with  hookers, a "hookers night". We would send  out invitations'to the feminist groups and  ask for a few women from each group to come  We don't know when this will be yet, as  we do not have money to rent a space.  K: What work does ASP have planned for the  future?  A: We have recently sent out information  packets to the labour groups, the feminist  groups and the gay rights groups. We've  mailed these out and asked for a letter  writing campaign. We are starting to talk  about setting up a defence fund. The women  who work the streets are in danger of losing their children if they are picked up.  If the amendments come through, there will  be a $500 fine or 15 days in jail if they  are picked up. If they don't have $500  and don't get the time to pay it, what's  going to happen to their children? They  .rses but do not have practical will be apprehended and so the women will  street experience, and they are intimidated  by the kids. We were at a meeting last week  and two 17 year olds told how the male  group home staff has been molesting the one  kid for a long time. He was sexually harassing her, coming on to her, touching her  need money for defense.  We are also talking about having our own  panel on prostitution around July, or August.  An evening discussion on prostitution. 16 Kinesis May'83  Prostitution: a history of legal developments  by Kate Andrew  Prostitution, strictly speaking, is not  illegal in Canada. However, its absence  from the Criminal Code does not mean that  prostitution is a legal activity.  From 1892, with the introduction of the  first Criminal Code in Canada, until 1972,  prostitution was dealt with as a form of  vagrancy. The "Vag C" provisions (S.175(1)  (c), presumed every woman who "being a  common prostitute or nightwalker is found  in a public place and does not, when required, give a good account of herself" to  be a vagrant and in contravention of the  Criminal Code.  Increasing pressure on the federal government, most notably from the Royal Commission on the Status of Women brought about  the repeal of the "Vag C" provisions and the  government replaced them in 1972 with the  introduction of S. 195.1 of the Criminal  Code. Section 195.1 makes soliciting for  for the purpose of prostitution illegal.  In addition, S. 193 of the Code prohibits  the keeping of a common bawdy house  (brothel). Therefore, the means of attracting customers, essential to carrying on  business as a prostitute, is made illegal,  although prostitution itself is not against  the law.  Police forces across Canada have been unsatisfied with the powers made available to  them in S. 195.1 ever since the 1978  Supreme Court of Canada decision, Regina v.  Hutt. In this case the highest court in  Canada decided that for soliciting to be  considered criminal it must be "pressing  and persistent". They also held that a car  Bibliography on Prostitution  Goddesses,  Whores,  Wives and Slaves,  by  Sarah Pomeroy - Schocken Books, -not too  much on the whores.

The significance  of the decision was to make it impossible  for police to entrap prostitutes by having  them make an offer to a police officer in  an unmarked police car, as they had in the  Hutt case, since S. 195 requires the soliciting be done in a public place.  More importantly, the decision also meant  that a simple offer, or even several simple  offers, could not constitute soliciting,  for purposes of the section. A prostitute,  it was decided, must make more than a simple indication that she is willing to prostitute herself for charges to be laid.  Police have complained bitterly about the  Hutt decision, saying it has encouraged  the rapid development of street prostitutior  in Canada, thereby creating insurmountable  problems for residents of areas such as  the West End of Vancouver, where prostitutes congregate. They also claim that it  has allowed a 'criminal sub-culture' to  develop and thrive.  In response to the police and the complaints of a variety of resident groups,  municipal governments started introducing  city by-laws prohibiting prostitution.  Montreal was the first city in Canada to  bring in legislation making it illegal to  remain in a public place for prostitution  or to solicit for the purpose of prostitution. The by-law, first introduced in  May 1980, was struck down by Quebec courts  as being unconstitutional. Similar by-laws  were brought into effect in Halifax and  Calgary, and Vancouver joined the group in  April, 1982 with its own 'Street Activities' by-law.  However, the power of city governments to  legislate against prostitution was clearly  attacked in a decision of the Supreme  Court in December, 1982. In the Westendorp  case, an 18 year old woman was arrested  under the Calgary city by-law which prohibited people from remaining on city  streets for the purpose of prostitution.  In both the Montreal case and in the  Westendorp case the higher courts stated  that a city does not have the constitutional authority to make laws relating to  'criminal' activity.  The British North America Act, now part of  the Constitution Act, 1982, divides up  areas of legislative authority between the  federal and provincial governments. Municipalities receive their authority from provincial governments and therefore aire  also limited to acting within the bounds  of provincial government power. The federal government is given sole authority when  it comes to criminal law, which is why  criminal law is consistent across the  country, while other matters, such as  motor-vehicle legislation, varies greatly  from province to province.  Even before.the Supreme Court made it  clear to cities across the country that  they did not have the authority to legislate against prostitution, police forces  insisted that they considered city by-laws  only ari interim measure. Heavy lobbying  from the police, city mayors and a few  vocal resident organizations, most notably  Concerned Residents of the West End(CROWE)  from Vancouver, pushed the House of Commons  to review the present Criminal Code provisions relating to prostitution, with a  view to reversing the effect of the Hutt  decision.  The House of Commons Standing Committee on  Justice and Legal Affairs has recently  sent its recommendations concerning street  prostitution to the Minister of Justice,  Mark McGuigan, for his consideration. The  recommendations include: 1) broadening the  definition of 'public place' so as to  include cars; 2) amending S 195.1 to clarify the fact that both the prostitute and  the customer can be charged with solicit  ing (currently in B.C. only the prostitute  can be charged and in Ontario the Court  of Appeal has held that both the customer  and client can be charged under S. 195.1);  3) adding a section to the Criminal Code  to make it illegal to offer, or accept  an offer, to engage in prostitution in a  public place, thereby getting around the  requirement of the offer having to be  'pressing and persistent'; and 4) adding  an offence, making it illegal to offer or  accept an offer to engage in prostitution  with a person under 18, whether or not  they believe the person to be 18. This  latter recommendation includes a particularly interesting footnote as it rejects a  defence of 'honest belief, so that a  person is guilty of the offence whether or  not they know or honestly believe that  the person is 18.  When feminists attempted to have the  'honest belief defence done away with in  the new sexual assault legislation government officials insisted that the defence  was a cornerstone of the criminal law and  that it would be entirely out of the question to dispense with it in order to better protect rape victims. In defending the  exclusion of the defence in the recommendations, Mark McGuigan informed the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women  lobby day on March 28, 1983 that he  thought children deserved a certain amount  of protection, a principle that the NAC  lobbyists made clear to McGuigan they  felt ought to apply equally to the women  of Canada as well as the children.  The effect of these recommendations are  easy enough to predict. They will limit  street prostitution, for a short while,  penalize the women working the streets,  who already face enormous burdens and will  in no way effectively deal with the major  problems affecting both the prostitutes  and the residents of areas such as the West  End in Vancouver. Criminalizing an activity  that is essentially not criminal and is  consensual benefits no one and unduly  harrasses women who face unpleasant lives  and working situations to start with. Criminal law will only limit, and even then,  only for a short time, the noise and nuisance problems which plague the residents.  A more reasonable response to the complaints and concerns of residents of the  West End would be to properly and effectively enforce current provincial legislation  dealing with residential tenancy and motor  vehicle legislation and similar regulatory  controls which would meet the complaints  of unsafe and noisy street congestion.  Where nuisance problems become so serious  as to warrant criminal law, the Criminal  Code already includes a variety of provisions (S. 171 Causing a Disturbance,  Indecent Exhibition, S. 169 Indecent Acts,  S. 381 Intimidation) which could be used.  The special problems attendant to child  prostitution can be dealt with more appropriately by provincial social services and  where necessary with existing Criminal  Code provisions.  The answers to the problem of prostitution  are essentially not legal ones - the social,  cultural and sexual evils of society are  not going to be solved overnight, nor is  prostitution going to be tidied up by  criminalizing it. Long term social service  and educational programs are needed to  assist the women who work the streets as  an alternative or an escape.  If you wish to express your disagreement  with the recommendations of the House  Standing Committee on Justice and Legal  Affairs write to: Hon. M. McGuigan,  Minister of Justice, House of Commons,  Ottawa, Ontario, and send copies to your  local M.P., P.C. Justice critic Ray  Hnatshyn, NDP Justice critic Lynn MacDonald and V.S.W. May '83 Kinesis 17  ARTS  'Singing for our lives'  by Susan Knutson  On April 23 this year, thousands walked for peace frov  Kits Point to Sunset Beach.  Once gathered in the bowl we  listened to Holly Near and  Ronnie Gilbert, two of the most  creative political musicians  working in our time, sing out  for an end to nuclear madness.  To a feminist audience, Holly's  career is well known; her story  is almost an analogue for the  development of women's music  in America. Ronnie Gilbert's  musical career reaches back to  the forties when, shortly after W.W.II, she joined Lee  Hays, Pete Seeger and Fred Hel-  lerman to form the Weavers, a  folk group destined to inspire  the folk revival of the fifties  and sixties. Many of the Weavers songs have passed into our  common cultural language, becoming campfire songs, like  Ledbelly's "Goodnight Irene",  or "On Top of Old Smokey", "If  I Had a.Hammer", and "Kisses  Sweeter Than Wine".  In the early fifties, the Weavers were blacklisted by McCarthy's anti-communist witchhunt.  The House Un-American Activities Committee labelled them  subversives in the entertainment industry, and they were  subsequently banned from print  and electronic media, clubs  and concert halls. Although  their records continued to sell,  it became increasingly difficult to secure bookings. The  Weavers turned to building a  concert audience for folk music  on the campuses and in the  union halls of the United  States. In 1952 they recorded  their last album. Since 1964  Ronnie has been working in  theatre. After receiving her  degree in clinical psychology,  she began practicing as a therapist in Berkeley and the Slo-  can Valley.  In 1980 the Weavers were reunited for a concert at Carna-  gie Hall, an event that was  recorded in the documentary  film, "Wasn't That A Time?"  Critics noted that "Ronnie Gilbert seemed revitalized by  feminism - the new songs "Hay  Una Mujer" and "Something  About the Women" were by far  the strongest. For Ronnie Gilbert, collaboration with Holly  Near has added a new thread to  an already rich tapestry.  The two artists agreed to speak  to me in the hour before their  concert at the Queen Elizabeth  Theatre Saturday night. Ronnie  was interrupted to get some  dinner before it was all gone,  and Holly, while I spoke to her,  was ironing the flowing pale  blue suit she would wear later  that night("when I first came  out one of the hardest things  was deciding what to wear...  now I wear whatever I want.")  SK: How did you come to be playing with Holly Near?  RG:' At a time when I really  wasn't listening to much music,  Holly dedicated one of her records to me, the one called  "The Live Album". I didn't  know who she was, my daughter  actually called me about it and  let me know...and I was sent a  record when they finally found  my address.  I was terribly moved by that  record. It seemed to me that it  touched on so many of the issues  that as a woman I was concerned  with and feeling, although I  was not part of the  tit at that time.  I was also terrifically moved  by the fact that she wasn't a  folksinger in the usual sense -  though she can certainly handle folk material - that she  had brought together so many  other kinds of American-type  music, you know, contemporary  music. That was a very exciting thing to me because I  always thought that songs  bearing the weight of social  commitment and social purpose  could be done to different  kinds of music and wondered  why it seemed only the folk  field used to do that.  When the Weavers had a reunion at; Carnagie Hall, I was  very eager to have some songs  of Holly's, and I proposed  two songs to the Weavers for  the concert. I wanted that  concert not to be just about  the past, but to bring to the  audience that came to see us  out of old love, a chance to  hear something new, something  that was going on, and to  know that that didn't stop  with the Weavers, by a long  shot.  The producers then decided to  film the concert and to extend the movie from a very  small piece of work to a full  length thing. They were wanting to talk to people who  felt that the Weavers had been  a big influence on them and  Holly made herself available  to come to New York and be  filmed with me, and we did,  quite spontaneously, sing that  song, "Hay Una Mujer", in the  movie. There was such a response to that tiny little  scene in the film, people began to call up the Redwood  Records office and say, when  is there going to be a concert^  And so, longl before ! I even  knew about it there was a concert being cooked up in the  minds of the Redwood women.  We sang together at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival  last summer, really just doing kind of in-between things,  you know, relieving the Masters and Mistresses of Ceremony... and it seemed that  every time we got up and sang  something electric happened  between us and the audience,  and so shortly after that it  was proposed that we do this  concert together.  That's the long story about  how we got together. We hoped,  very much, to bring together  many different kinds of audiences that are people of good  will and who care for the planet, for the issues, for the  needs of human beings; different groups of people who are  focused on different things,  just by our being there, differences in long historical  traditions, differences in  age, commitments to various  things, and that seems to be  happening.  SK: In your days as a Weaver,  did you ever play for an audience as large as the one this  afternoon? 'assjijsP'  RG: No, I have a recollection  of some audiences that just  went on endlessly, it might  have been one of the folk  festivals or something like  that, but I don't know about  80,000 people, I think that  was quite extra-ordinary.  The time is right for us to  pull together on all kinds of  issues, to understand that to  be a feminist you also have to  care about all the women of  this planet, including the  ones who are economically  oppressed and who may not be  able to benefit from legislation...We need to take care of  the planet.  A demonstration like today, we  don't hear about them, they  happen in Europe all the time.  The Europeans don't know that  we have this enormous peace  movement here, so we have to  find ways to communicate with  one another. Holly and I are  only two people - she does the  most extraordinary job of doing  this all the time, and Im very  privileged to be able to join  her...  SK: Bet she feels the same way.  How did you feel today looking  at the 80,000 or so who were  out?  HN: I was pretty startled when  I heard that the population was  a million - so that meant almost one out of every ten people. I had the same feeling I  had when I was in New York on  June 12.  SK: What was June 12?  HN: It was the largest antiwar demonstration in the history of the United States.  Close to a million people  marched all the way up all the  avenues in New York and ended  up filling all of Central Park,  and it was just...you know,  there were wonderful puppets  and different contingencies,  this and that, and people who  didn't agree on things, march  ing. You just can't call that  a fringe element...so I felt  that way today, that not everybody even who wanted to be  there was there - people who  are in prisons, people who are  in institutions and couldn't  come, who couldn't get childcare or who are working nine  to five on a Saturday, people  who have family stuff they had  to do, people who are afraid of  demonstrations but who agree...  It was exciting also to be here  as a feminist and also as a  person from the United States  because I think it's important  for people around the world  who have a very critical attitude towards the Reagan administration, to meet those people  who are not represented by imperialism. ..you know the United  States is filled with good-  hearted peace-loving people,  and I think it's good to have  an exchange like this. 18 Kinesis May'83  ARTS  Sandra Birdsell  Storyteller shares her experiences  by Barbara Herringer  Night Travellers  by Sandra Birdsell, 184pp., $6.95 paper  Turnstone Press, Winnipeg.  1982  Sandra Birdsell,  a Manitoba writer, was  recently in Vancouver to promote and read  from her first book of stories, Night  Travellers.  Sexuality,  age,  creativity,  religion and primarily survival are among  the themes that weave through the lives of  the Lafreniere family.  Each of the thirteen stories is complete  in itself but also connects with the others  to create an intricate portrait of the  family through their different reactions  and points of view.  Birdsell's power and  talent as a storyteller is evident from  the first page to the last in this remarkable collection.  I interviewed her while she was in Vancouver:  BH:  The stories in Night Travellers  seem  to concern a working class family and I'm  wondering if that's your background as  well. Is it hard for you to write about  that?  SB:  Oh no. In fact I was finding it  really difficult to identify with a lot of  writing that is being done by Canadian  women in that I could not identify with  their experience. I was reading about women  who had a suspicion that they were extremely intelligent — a woman in one story  could read both French and English before  she was four years old; - and I always felt  so inferior when I read those kinds of  stories. I couldn't tell the time when I  was seven years old in grade two.  So I was having a hard time identifying  with the woman who thought that there was  something wrong with her because boys  didn't like her. If she had straight hair  she wished it was curly, and if she had  curly hair she wished it was straight. Or  else she was fat.  And lo and behold she went to university  to find out that she was very bright -  extremely intelligent, which had been her  problem all along. She was really much  smarter than the men she associated with.  So off she would go - she was usually  married or something - she would leave her  children to I find herself. Off she would go  and achieve wonderful things.  And I used to clap and say, 'that's great'  but I don't understand how did she do all  these things? How did she make money? What  about the nitty gritty thing of having the  old man walk out and you have no job skills  because all you've done is you've been a  homemaker for 15 years and you have to go  out and start selling yourself to some  employer.  I wanted to read about those kind of women,  and I wasn't. The woman who I really loved  reading was Grace Paley. I don't know if  you're familiar with her; her work really  grabbed me because she was writing about  that kind of a woman.  And so I think I was really influenced by  Grace Paley when I sat down to write a  novel about a battering parent. I want to  continue to write stories - because these  are people who don't get into fiction  often enough. That's why the man in my new  story is a mechanic. And the husbands are  factory workers or auto mechanics, because  that's my experience. And that's the experience of a lot of women around me.  BH:  You've partially answered the question that I was going to ask about women  writers who come out of an academic tradition. That's obviously not your experience.  Given that your experience is similar to  the people you're writing about, how did  you become a writer?  SB:  OK. The actual how of becoming a  writer. I always knew that I was a very  creative person, because when I was young  it didn't matter what I did, whether it was  music - I played the piano by ear very well  ...any kind of art work I did extremely  well.  I always had a way with words. I was a  very poor student - I hated school. The  only thing I really worked at was English.  I left school in Grade 10 because I was  really, really unhappy at home. I started  running away from home when I was about  13. But I left for good when I was 15. I  just stuck out my thumb one night and  said, 'that's it.' I think it was even my  fifteenth birthday.  I went to small towns in Manitoba and got  a job as a waitress, and then went to the  city and worked in a drug store. Of course  "I saw a lot of things that upset  me terribly. So I sat down one  night and I wrote about nursing  care homes."  one of my characters works in a drug  store. I've worked in a hospital - a file  clerk and that sort of thing. The person  I worked for was' a doctor, a woman doctor,  and she wanted me to move home with her -  she wanted to look after me and send me  to school. But I was afraid she'd disci-  line me too much. I had people telling me  about the possibilities for my future. I  listened and I went home and went back to  school. And about half way through the  term I met my present husband and became  pregnant. I graduated in June and was  married in July.  So for the next fifteen years I had children - three of them - and I raised them  and I loved it. I find having children  very creative. I had two children very  quickly and then I didn't have children  for eight years and I started writing in  that period - about anger. My husband was  a factory worker. We rented rooms out to  pay the rent. I had no money to do anything - I was totally frustrated.  I have at home in a box paper mache fruits  and things to remind myself how I kept  busy because I was going to go crazy. So  I'd work with my kids and we'd do paper  mache, and copper tooling - whatever didn't  cost too much money. And I read a great  deal.  At that time my father died. I had spent  six months every day with him in a nursing  care home, and I saw a lot of things that  upset me terribly. So I sat down one night  and I wrote about nursing care homes. I  entered it in a contest, and I won it. And  then I sent the article off to an American contest and I won it. They gave me an  electric typewriter. And so I obviously  had to do something with that electric  typewriter.  I was contacted by a writers' organization  through this contest and they told me  about a workshop. I went to the workshop  and I heard someone read a short story  and I said, 'hey, I could do that.' And I  went home and tried, and I realized that  I'd have to do more than that.  I got books and started reading short  stories, and then went to university and  took some courses. And I met a very supportive professor who took me aside and  showed me what books he thought I should  read. You know the most supportive people  I've had in my writing career have been  men. So from there, I wrote thirty stories in one year. Grain published one,  and Rudy Weibe saw it, and he put it in  an anthology, Stories from Western Canada.  And that was it - after that I was sold  on the idea of writing.  BH:  How do people around you react to  your writing - your family, and friends?  SB:  My family initially thought - this  is great, it keeps mom off the streets,  keeps her out of trouble. My oldest son  couldn't care less - he never even asks me  about it. Now he's a father, and he's  trying to push 'now you're a grandmother'.  I'm resisting of course. That's his thing.  My oldest daughter was always very supportive and interested - to a point. And that  point was when it interfered with her life.  If she had to do something for herself that  she didn't normally have to do, then she  thought my writing was too important. And  my youngest one is writing herself - and  no, she's not really interested in my  work at all. My immediate family hates my  work.  ?s|S?^'*  BH:  Did they read the book?  SB:  One brother read it and told the rest  of my family not to read it.  BH?  They don't want to hear about these  things any more?  SB:  My brother who's got this lovely virgin wife and all that - doesn't want to  read about what might have been his sister's sexuality. It's a thing that goes on  in families - you don't want to face up to  your parents' sexuality, at some point,  and I guess that's what he was facing.  One sister read it, and said, "I can understand if other people read it they see  really wonderful stories, but when I read  it I can't help seeing so many other  things.' She'll say, 'I'll be reading  along, and oh boy, this is dad. And then  I'll come to a point and say, hey, that's  not dad.' And so I guess it presents a  problem for them, but no, they're not very  happy with what I'm doing.  But I think you have to take that chance -  if you're writing, you've got to. That's  being honest. continued on next page May'83 Kinesis 19

BH:  I think that's hard for a lot of
women - or writers - people who are dealing
with a background that doesn't 'measure
up' to the status quo - the middle class,
or whatever, to have their family see that.
It must be incredibly intimidating for
them, or scary for you, regardless of get-
ting it'out,  ', "\"f,
SB:  Yeah - it's frightening. But you
know, I know too many people who are waiting for their, parents to die to be able to
write what they really want to write. I
think that's sad.
BH:  Were you encouraged to be creative
in your family?
SB: My mother couldn't afford to give us
music lessons, so she baked cookies for
the music teacher - three dozen a week. I
was from a very well-educated background.
Her father was ,a professor in the Ukraine
- he's a Mennonite, and so was her uncle.
They lost a lot when they came to Canada.
My grandfather - when they came to Canada
he couldn't speak English, so he couldn't
teach here. So he became a farmer, and he
was a miserable farmer - he failed.
And  then he tried to run a boarding house
in Winnipeg - he failed at that. Then
someone took pity on them and bought them
a home in Morris, and the daughters had to
go to work to support their parents.
My mother, when she came to this country,
was about 12 years old and couldn't speak
English. They put her in a grade one class,
and within six or seven months she could
speak English and she was in sixth grade.
Her father took her out of school to go
and work down the road for- a farmer and his
wife because they needed the money, and
she never went back to school. I think
that's incredibly sad.
BH: Do you have a sense of what that meant
in her life?
SB:  You know what? She probably talks to
me about these things more than anyone
else, and we've talked about it a lot
recently and she sees the terrible unfairness of it. And in fact, when my dad died
about seven or eight years ago - she was
62 or 63 and she learned how to do her own
banking, she learned how to drive a car,'
she started a business. She's 72 now -
she's just begun oil painting. And I'm
happy for her.
BH:  Were you encouraged to go to school?
SB:  No; my family really promoted education for the' boys. All my brothers
but one are university educated, and I
guess it was - boys are going to have to
make a living, etc. But with the girls,
it was, 'let's not waste the money.' We
were expected to get married very quickly
so that we'd be gone and my mother wouldn't
have to worry about us. We all married at
16 or 17 except for one.
BH:  Are the kind of people that you're
writing about going to read this?
SB:  That's the thing that really bothers
me about going to work in the high schools
and having the teachers pre-read my book.
They say, 'this is a touchy class, there's
some Dutch reform people here. We'd rather
you didn't read the more explicit stories.
We think there's nothing wrong with them,
but we get feedback from the community.'
And always that's the case - I don't think
it's so much a total lack of knowledge
about what's happening in their kids'
lives as just not wanting to face up to
it. Sure, I think that every last one of
these stories could be really beneficial
to kids, especially in a rural community,
but ...
BH:  It wasn't clear whether Truda went
off to study fine arts or whether she
eventually got married. Do you think
there's a chance for creativity in the
situations you describe?
SB: I really don't know. Looking at it
from my own personal life, branching out
into creativity through writing has presented many many problems. I like to think
it can work. I'm trying to make it work.
It might not though.
I look at Truda and I'm thinking that if
she marries Brian, it's not going to happen to the extent that it might have happened if she hadn't married him.
Somewhere,  a child grew up without me,
she wishes to tell the youngest.    He
has as much to do with shaping your
existence here as have the first set
tlers,  the women who cranked out their
years in a one-room sod house,  the
Indians who hunted these plains for
buffalo,  or the Mennonite farmers.
But she won't say it.  She will,  in
stead, move the memory out across an
ancient lake and leave it there to
find its rest among the glaciers.
(from "There is No Shoreline", in
Night Travellers).
I'm seeing it around me with a lot of
women right now - who are managing to do
it within the framework - I don't want
to use confines - of marriage, but they
pay a price. It's like anything a woman
wants to do - whether she wants to become
a lawyer or a doctor or build a business.
It all takes time. It all takes a tremendous amount of head time and concentration
away from family.
But I think that the only thing that makes
it more acceptable for a.woman to do that
- art - is that she makes good money.
That's the bottom line. It's tremendously
difficult for anyone - but especially a
woman, I th^nk - to be able to reconcile,
even to herself, that taking huge blocks
of time to write piddly little stories
that you get fifty bucks for, is really
a worthwhile thing to be doing. The floors
are dirty, the walls are caked, the beds
aren't made, the kid is in trouble at
school - what are you doing? But you see,
if I was bringing in a wonderful salary,
then everyone would understand about
what I'm doing.
BH: Has it been intimidating for you to
be with writers who come from an academic
tradition?
SB:  It's really strange. I was really
depressed about my work after it was published. I went to a poetry conference and
I went to a panel discussion - people who
make their money being teachers at universities. I went because I really thought
that there was something there that was
going to help me with my work or give me
some insight. They may as well have been
speaking Greek, because I didn't understand anything. I came away from that
conference even doubly unhappy about what
I was doing. And I thought, that's it.
What do you think you're doing? You don't
have the backup of knowledge - you're
always inventing the wheel. Always discovering things that have been discovered
ages ago.
And then the review - it must have been
two days later - William French's review
in the Globe^and Mail. And it was like
someone patting me on the back and saying
'there there, don't worry. You're doing
fine.'
And I realized that I don't ever want to
be doing so fine that I don't have to
keep reading and I don't have to keep
learning and that sort of thing. Maybe I
can't talk writing, but I can do it.

She was difficult to categorize: the sound  she seemed to be striving for was decidedly  new wave yet she'd written lyrics for a  Cerrone hit, the European Disco King. She  and musical collaborator Les Chapell showed an uncannily sophisticated appreciation  of the contemporary music field by including back to back the almost ballad-like,  "Too Tender"(to touch) with the catchy uptempo, "Say When". In 1983, with much  popular music relying on a sound that is  nearer to disco than punk, it's easy to  see in hindsight that Lovich was ahead of  her time.  Appearing at the Commodore in late April,  she provided old and new fans with just  the right balance of familiar and unfamiliar material. Fronting a five piece band  that included two synthesizers, Lovich  gave us a tantalizing glimpse of her own  ability as an instrumentalist when she  opened the show on sax and later contributed with a muted trumpet. The band's  playing was, if anything, understated. It  was a rare treat not to feel assaulted by  noise.  The line "watch my every move" from one of  her songs captures the essence of Lovich's  performance. Floating, jumping and prowling  across the stage, she was never still.  Like Nina Hagen, Lovich's stage theatrics  underpin her musical presentation. Like  Hagen, too, Lovich borrows from a variety  of musical traditions, including operatta  in the delightful parody "Mein Smerz".  Dressed from head-to-foot in a white Victorian wedding dress complete (for the  first few numbers) with a veil over a mass  of plaits and braids, Lovich turned the  idea of a cute female front singer upside  down. Her interpretation of her familiar  song, "Home" was a delight. Its allusion  to the claustrophobic environment that  from "Stateless" by Lene Lovich  home represents for many people shows a  darker side of Lovich. For me it is her  best contribution to date to the increasing pool of "standards" written and performed by women. It was the final number  of an unusual and inspiring evening by  Lovich: her music, her band, her show.  What  can one  woman do?  by Lisa Jenkinson  There is a line in a song in Headlines  Theatre's latest production Under the Gun  which asks, "What can one woman do?"  The woman referred to is a worker in a  plant which produces surveillance equipment and guidance systems for missiles.  She had never been exactly aware of what  was the intention of the end product until  she received a leaflet which included detailed information on end use of these  guidance systems.  She became concerned and confused: should  she quit her job?; try to make her coworkers aware of the situation?; what  could she do? Throughout the rest of the  show, we discover what she could and did  do.  Under the Gun, a Disarming Revue is Headlines Theatre's second major production,  their first being Buy Buy Vancouver, (a  show about the housing crisis), which was  done here two years ago. Under the Gun is  a clever, entertaining and thought-provok-<  ing revue which addresses various "hot"  political issues that we are faced with  today.  These issues include U.S. and Canadian intervention in Third World countries, nuclear disarmament, Canadian involvement in  the arms race, exploitation of Third World  countries, Canadian interest in the Phili-  pines and more. It's a well-written and  researched piece which is presented in a  revue format using music, dance, mime,  short scenes and monologues. After each  performance there is a question-and-answer  period where the company and audience exchange recent and relevant information  concerning the issues presented.  The cast in this production consists of:  C. Holte Davidson, Karen Darcy, David Diamond, Pat Keating, Nettie Wild and Reid  Campbell. After seeing the show I talked  to Diamond, and asked him when and how  this project began.  Fundraising began one and a half years  ago when Project Ploughshares, a Canadian  church-based organization, asked Headlines  Theatre to do a show on disarmament. Diamond went to Europe in the spring of 1982  to meet with and gather information from  theatre and film groups and disarmament  organizations. He returned to Canand in  June and the United Church and Project  Ploughshares sent Diamond and Nettie Wild  to New York to attend the second Special  Session on Disarmament. There they met  Noam Chomsky, the author of various books  on militarism. He made them aware of the  fact that diaarmament is only the tip of  the iceberg and that the root of the problem is intervention. This has become one  of the strong themes of Under the Gun.  Fundraising and research continued over  the summer of 1982 and last October the  core group came together. Also last October, U.N. Disarmament Week was held here  and the group met with people from all  over the world who are involved in the  disarmament issue, and they received a  great deal of helpful information, books,  films, etc.  The research went on during October and  November and the show was written during  December and January. January, February  and March were rehearsal times and rewrites, and Under the Gun opened on March  18th at the Oak St. Unitarian Church.  Since then it has played in various places  in Vancouver as well as successfully touring Vancouver Island.  Under the Gun will run May 25th to June  5th at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre  during the Festival of Peacemaking. It's  well worth seeing. May'83 Kinesis 21  PERFORMANCE ARTS  Toward a female aesthetic  Breaking the unspoken taboo  by Michele Wollstonecroft  "A political artist simply says,  this  has got to be done now - we've got no more  time.  That sense of compelling urgency  pushed me way, way beyond my dreamed-of  capacity." (Gay Bell,  Everywoman's  Almanac,  1983.)  Christina Estable is a performance artist  with a pointedly political message. She  creates and communicates a female biological, sociological and political experience through her works.  What makes Christina's performance, art  particularly interesting to me is how she  unabashedly breaks with the artworld's  unspoken taboo regarding women's domestic  experience. While the artworld openly  welcomes women's art that speaks of the  "magical" and "mystical" nature of womanhood it has not been a forum for expression of the most common experiences of a  majority of women.  Christina has performed such pieces as  Monochrome Chromosomes and Unpaid Labour  which deal with childbearing, the artist  and the mother as unpaid labourers, the  powerlessness of a woman who is economically dependant on a man, poverty, and anger.  Talking about a female aesthetic in Performance Art, Christina says she sees the  structural concerns as common to both female and male performance artists. "The  plastic, purely plastic elements involved:  movement, sound, visuals, verbals, all  have to work to make it a good piece or  a bad piece. And over and above that,  when you look at content that's when you  get into a purely female aesthetic or a  feminist aesthetic..."  As for the elements that make up performance, Christina says: "It's really the  place where you can be multidisciplinary,  where you can speak many verbal languages  as one statement...It is not video, it  is not theatre, it is not dance, it is not  music, it is not visuals, but an arena in  which all these players can inter-react...  Being a visual artist, I see Performance  Art pieces as paintings and I often use  that analogy because people seem to be  able to relate to it quite easily, and so  you have an arrangement: the movement  has to go a certain way, the sounds have  to go a certain way, and all that has to  work together..."  Unpaid Labour, presented at Festival '82,  last July, reflects the sociological experience of women in our society. It is  a piece that makes the audience aware of  the real lack of power experienced by the  housewife in Canada. Regardless of the  status of a woman's spouse, this performance is a reminder that in most cases the  one thing that stands between the Shaug-  nessy Housewife and her Sister on Welfare,  is a man.  This performance includes six performers,  two of whom are singers, 6ne (Christina)  who carries on the dialogue and the other  three who use props and movement. The dialogue and songs tell of the housewife's  lack of money and power to borrow money,  her lack of funds to carry out her work,  or to buy proper tools, or to feed her  children. It juxtaposes the value placed  on the time of the white collar worker  against the "non-value" placed on the time  of the female parent.  Throughout the songs and dialogue, the  women with the props gesture and move  on stage in various choreographed directions, wearing yellow rubber gloves, carrying red plastic babies, brooms, dish-  racks and toilet brushes. They walk in a  circle around a road sign that states,  "Crew and Equipment "Working."  During the performance slides showing unwashed dishes in a sink, articles from  newspapers and magazines about women and  poverty in Canada, pictures of children,  Christina herself during her pregnancy and  cartoons of political figures are projected onto the rear screen. The other performers in Unpaid Labour were Betty Mac-  kim, Leah Jewall, Judy Price, Maria West  and Heather Soles.  Monochrome Chromosomes centres on the female biological experience of childbearing  and birthing. Taken from Christina's  experience of birthing her children, Daniel  and Alicia, this piece deals with the  recessive-gene phenomenon in red-haired  humans, as well as the timely issues of  midwifery and obstetric gynecology. This  performance was presented at Metro Media  in October, 1982, with the assistance of  Jim Chambers on electric violin, electric  guitar and backup vocals.  Monochrome Chromosomes includes an exhibition, which is hung around the performance space prior to the performance, and  removed during the latter part of the performance. The exhibition includes coba-  chrome prints, black and white and sepia-  toned photographs, blue print work, and  monochrome colour Xerox. The exhibition  is made up of two groups of work. The  first, the "Pre-Natal" pieces, include  Christina during pregnancy, daughters of  midwives, and Christina clad in a "belly-  cast" (documented from an earlier piece  called Performance Bellycast). The second  from Performance Bodycasts  group, the "Post Partum" prints, are all  Xerox images (monochromatic) of Christina's  daughter, Alicia, as a newborn.  The performance itself includes slides,  sound, music, movement, and props. The  "slides are actually negatives, mounted  and projected, which give an eerie monochromatic effect. They include images  taken from books about midwifery, obstetrics and gynecology. The sound tape is  from the birthing of Daniel, Christina's  son. Throughout the performance the audience is provided with complimentary rose-  coloured glasses allowing them to experience the piece in monochromatic light.  In addition to her performance art, Christina continues to work in fabric and  visual art materials. Vancouverites may be  familiar with this work as it has been  shown, among other places, in the Woman-  size show (Women in Focus, 1981), the  Fiber and Fabric Show at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre Gallery (1982), and the 4th  Annual Robson Square Media Centre Quilting Exhibition (1982).  Christina extensively researches her information for both her performance art and  her fabric work. Working from such a solid  base she is able to experiment a great  deal. She makes her own dyes, working  with different plants and natural sources  of pigment, as well as a variety of methods of extracting colour from their source,  Prior to moving to B.C. in 1979, Christina  exhibited her work and performed in Montreal and Quebec City. Christina studied at  Sir George Williams University, Montreal,  Laval University in Quebec City, and the  Emily Carr College of Art, here in Vancouver .  Christina is a single parent and lives  with Daniel and Alicia in central Vancouver. This month, as part of "Mother's Day,  a Trilogy" she will be exhibiting at La  Quena Coffee House, 1111 Commercial Drive  and she will be performing at Metro Media  Associates, 1037 Commercial Drive.

She believes all of us, men  and women, participate in this "pornographic mind" since we have all been  assigned various roles (victim, seducer,  conqueror) in pornographic scenes. Those  Pornography and Silence: Culture's  Revenge Against Nature  by Susan Griffin.  Harper Colophon Books  Harper and Row, Publishers  New York, 1981   selfsame pornographic roles reflect society's ideas generally about men and women,  power, and sexuality, and in this way have  affected us all. Primarily though, she  uses the term "pornographic mind".when  referring to the nature of the male psyche  which creates pornography.  Griffin sees our society as one in which  there is a profound split between the  mind and the body and the values assigned  to each. Mental and spiritual activities  are highly valued; knowledge and experience of the body and physical being are  devalued and repressed.  Of course, in our culture, this kind of  division occurs along gender lines. Human  qualities of sensuality, intuition,  softness and passion are understood as  feminine and human capacities to reason*  to know or to master are understood as  masculine.  Griffin sees these opposing sides of the  split, at war within individual psyches  as well as within our society generally.  It is this profound split and lack of  integration of what she calls "nature"  and "culture", that she sees as the origin of the "pornographic mind."  She says the "pornographic mind" denies  a part of itself - its awareness of itself as a physical being, as a body that  has desire, that is dependent, that is not  always in control. And this denied part  is hated and feared, because it is experienced as being out of control, in need  of being mastered. It is this denied part  of the male psyche that is projected onto  women in pornography.  The origin of this split between "nature"  and "culture", says Griffin, occurs in  infancy. An infant is fully dependent on  its mother. All sustenance, love and  comfort as well as hunger, fear and pain  are perceived as coming from her. And the  knowledge of these things, the knowledge  of the body,  comes to the infant from her.  She is loved for satisfying physical desires and, at times, hated for denying  that satisfaction.  Griffin suggests that this ambivalence  towards the mother, which includes  feelings of rage and rejection as well as  love, is a problem of human infancy, but  one which could be mediated by a culture.  Our culture does not do that. It represses  knowledge of both the body and the emotions. Instead of helping us understand  ourselves as physical beings with physical  needs and emotional desires for dependency  and closeness, our culture "in all its  institutions, denies the importance of  physical being and our connection with  nature.  Hence, the original ambivalence of the  infant continues to be experienced as  having been created by one parent, a  female parent, rather than arising from  the reality of our physical being.  The fact that this emotional ambivalence  and first understanding of the body was  experienced by the infant in relation to  a woman, is continually reinforced by our  culture. The child sees that women are  degraded and seen as lesser beings - that  they are portrayed in humiliating images,  The mother is soon perceived as powerless  in relation to the father and the culture  generally. If the child is male, he is  offered the world of his father instead  - the world of culture, thought, exploration, control. It is a world based not on  firsthand sensual knowledge as learned  from his mother, but a world based on  knowledge that must be taken on authority.  As a consequence he buries a part of himself. It is the denial of his knowledge of  his body and feelings, the part he cannot  claim as his own because of its humiliation (but which nevertheless continues to  exist) that comes back to haunt him.  And it is this denial, that Griffin sees  as the force behind the creation of pornographic images in which female bodies  (nature) are controlled, humiliated and  violated. The women in pornography are  symbols for the denied parts of himself -  his desire for closeness, dependency, and  sensuousness - which in pornography he  humiliates.  Griffin traces many images in which women's  will is mastered, where women speak only  to be silenced, where women's bodies are  mutilated, where sexuality is associated  with humiliation, where a profound split  exists between the body and the mind or  spirit, and where feeling and mutuality do  not exist.  She convincingly portrays pornography as  an expression "not of human erotic feeling  and desire, and not of a love of the life  of the body, but of a fear of bodily  knowledge, and a desire to silence eros."  Griffin looks at questions such as why the  hatred and desire for revenge on women's  bodies is so intense. Why has sexuality  become so associated with humiliation,  taking the form of dominance/submission?  She examines intricately the relationship  between psyche formation, the mind/body  split of patriarchal culture, and pornography .  For me, this focussed the necessity of  looking at the nature of human infancy  and the resulting forms of ambivalence  and denial which men in particular experience toward female power and physical  being. This leads to questions about how  to change child rearing practices so that  men are part of a child's association  with feelings and sensual being (which  Dorothy Dinnerstein has also explored in  her book, The Mermaid and the Minotaur).  This also raises the necessity of radical  change in the culture, so that women are  present, visible and powerful within it.  Griffin does not look at why we have had  such an explosion of pornography occurring  in the last few years. And it seems important to examine this. Who is controlling  and profiting from the expanding pornography business? Why are men increasingly  buying pornography? What are the political  and social realities affecting this? How  has the merging of "nature" and "culture"  started by the women's movement threatened  male power?  Griffin's work has also made me aware  that we are only beginning to redefine  and envision what eroticism could be -  how it could be a source of power and  affirmation within our lives as women.  Such possibility comes about, I think,  only after examining what has been presented to us in the guise of eroticism -  namely pornography.  Ann Novotny  continued from p. 19  her Master's Degree in English literature  from McGill. In 1958, she married George  Novotny, and they moved to New York City  in 1969, where she began work as a researcher for Central Feature News. Ann  then worked two years jointly for Time/  Life Books and the New York World's Fair  on the guidebooks for the exhibits at  the Fair. By 1963, she decided that the  corporate life wasn't for her, and started  her own freelance research firm.  Ann Novotny, together with her long-term  lover Rosemary Eakins, built Research  Reports into the premier firm of its kind,  providing picture sources and editorial  research for clients as varied as Hollywood feature films and textbook publishers.  Her lively curiosity made Ann an excellent  researcher. While searching for photographs  to a possible guidebook to Ellis Island,  Ann first saw Alice Austen's work at the  Staten Island Historical Society. She  then contacted Oliver Jensen, the editor  who had first recognized the value of  glass-plated negatives moldering away in  the Society's basement.  Jensen founded the Friends of Alice  Austen group after it was learned that  Alice was still living, confined to a  bed in the local poorhouse; the organization dedicated itself to raising funds  for Alice to live out her years on, as  well as preserving her work. Though Ann  Novotny had not met Alice Austen, in the  course of her growing involvement with her  photographs, Ann decided to write Alice's  World. She became chairwoman of the  Friends, leading the group in fighting to  have the deteriorating Alice Austen family home declared historically important  in order to save it from the imminent  wrecking ball.  Shortly.after Ann Novotny's death, the  New York City Parks Department finally  signed over one million dollars in contracts to restore Alice Austen's home and  turn it into a museum devoted to her work  - probably the first museum in this country for a woman photographer, and certainly  the first for a lesbian photographer.  by Judith Schwarz  (reprinted from Off Our Backs, January   '83) May'83 Kinesis 23  OPINION  Senator Project:  the gap between  theory and practice  On International Women's Day, 1983, five  female counselors walked off the job at a  half-way house for street kids, located  near the corner of Granville and Davie  Streets. Four of us; Barbara Isaac, Marian  Lydbrooke, Jannit Rabinovitch and Connie  Smith, had been employed at the Senator  Project since its inception nearly three  years ago. The fifth, Peggy Thompson, had  worked at the project for two years. The  decision to leave was the culmination of  several years of ihtense conflict and  struggle with management. Our resignation  letter said we "could no longer in good  conscience" continue to work for the Alternate Shelter Society. With our letter,  we submitted a list of issues which we  "have been fighting for" over the last 3  years. Although we received support from  individual social workers throughout the  Ministry of Human Resources and many  Senator staffj we were told that our concerns were dismissed by Ministry and Senator management because of their feminist  quality. "It's quite ironic that they  would use that against us," one of the women said, "considering I was told I was  hired to work at the Senator because I  was a feminist."  The blueprint for the Senator Hostel was  the brainchild of a group of concerned  social workers, lay counselors, and citizens who met over a period of months to  find an answer to the juvenile prostitution situation in this city. They became  known as the Davie Street Committee. However, when the Senator began in the fall  of 1980, it came under the management of  the Alternate Shelter Society, an organization the Ministry of Human Resources  contracted to provide an alternative for  teenagers living on the street.  In addition to the Senator Project, the  Alternate Shelter Society owns and operates Cypress House, an over-night resource  for juveniles, used frequently by MHR's  Emergency Services. They also operate  Valley House, a facility for teenagers in  New Westminster.  The management of the Alternate Shelter  Society expounds a very clear progressive  analysis of juvenile prostitution which  all five of us share. Our experience substantiates the position that children who  choose to work the streets have come from  a background of consistent abuse by adults  both in the family and in the system. The  abuse may be sexual, emotional and/or  physical. These children, in order to survive, run away from their abusive situa-  ion. Ultimately, they end up on the street  because street life appears to offer autonomy from adults and a support network  of peers.  However in reality, the street provides  yet another abusive environment where the  children continue to be used by adults -  economically, sexually, and emotionally.  In spite of this, the street continues to  attract these children with the promise of  money, the illusion of glamour, and a  false sense of independence.  What the Senator was' designed to provide  was an opportunity for these teenagers to  have positive non-abusive relationships  with adults. The project was described as  an opportunity for them to act out their  pain.with non-judgemental support from  adults, many of whom have had similiar  abusive experiences. The staff were described as "child advocates". This meant  that as counselors, they would support the  children rather than the many adults with  whom the teenagers continually find themselves in conflict.  Although a few of the staff had professional counseling experience, the majority of  the workers were hired because they weren't  traditional child-care workers in the system. The original staff consisted of lesbians, feminists, gay men, activists, natives, ex-street people, ex-prisoners,  hippies, artists, actors, writers, and  musicians. It was hoped that this deliberately mixed group of people would provide  alternate role models for the teenagers.  However, delivering a philosophy is one  thing. Putting it into practice is another.  Many different interpretations of this  philosophy might be possible, but in this  case, in our opinion, there was no clear  forum or collective discussion of how to  interpret the Senator's philosophy in a  practical way on the job.  Before the Senator opened, many pertinent  questions arose about the practical reality  of the day-to-day operation of the hostel.  Questions such as: how to deal with irate  pimps trying to get into the building;  fire risks; how to deal consistently with  drug and alcohol use; how to divide the  tasks in the hostel equally between male  and female staff; what is the project's  relationship with the police. However it  seemed to us that there was a strong  resistance to talk seriously about any of  these issues. The clear message from  management was "stay cool and everything  will take care of itself."  As time went on, our list of concerns  grew to include issues surrounding the  inability of staff to cope with rape and  abuse counseling, which was needed by the  teenagers on a continual basis. Teenage  girls who were being raped on the street  or by "dates", have been chastised by  certain male counselors with remarks like,  "What do you expect when you get into a  car with a stranger.", and so on. On one  occassion, in the case of a double rape,  the male counselor conferred with one of  the girls' fathers by telephone about how  stupid the girls had been to go to a  particular hotel, while the one female on  staff took the girls to the hospital and  began the crisis counseling.  This kind of experience was very common.  And these kinds of incidents intensified  our urgency to have a forum to discuss  rape and other serious concerns. Our worst  fears about prejudice and sexism were becoming realized. However, when staff meetings were held, our concerns were seen as  a direct attack, a criticism of management,  or worse yet, as the inability of the individual making the comment to be able to  cope with Senator life. It was consistently suggested that if we were more fully  focused on the kids we wouldn't have time  to worry about issues like sexism, counseling, lack of communication and consistency  among staff, violence and weapons in the  building, or relationships with police and  social workers. To us, and to a few of our  co-workers - male and female, these issues  were integral to working with the teenagers.  Oddly enough, in spite of these conflicts,  management attempted to foster the idea  that the staff was one big happy family.  In fact, many of the original staff consisted of management's relatives and  friends and some of these staff told us  they felt grateful to management for rescuing them from their previous lifestyles  and giving them some responsibility. Consequently, we felt that this undermined staff  working conditions because those people  gave management unconditional support and  trust. Also the emotional obligations that  these staff had to management "took their  power away from them" and their power was  replaced with favoritism - especially in  the scheduling of shifts. They were also  privy to confidential information about  other staff as well as given misinformation, which distorted their perceptions.  Another of our concerns was that there  was no staff hiring policy. And although  many of the long term staff were willing  to be involved in the hiring process t  because we had a clear idea of what the  work required, this was not allowed.  There was also no seniority list, and often  new staff were hired full-time over part-  time staff who had been promised full-time^  work as soon as it became available. There  was no formal grievance procedure to rectify this or any other employment problem.  Also, there were occasions when individuals left their employment interview having  been told they had the job, only to discover later that they did not.  New staff were not given training and in  some cases were not informed of the  Senator's "progressive" philosophy or even  told some of the most basic things about  working there. It was not uncommon for  newly hired heterosexual staff to have no  knowledge that there were gay teenagers in  the Senator and many gay counselors on  staff. Needless to say, this came as quite  a shock.  Like some of the original staff, the new  employees shared many of society's racist  and sexist assumptions which were detrimental to working with the teenagers. The  fact that there was no skill-sharing or  staff training provided by management,  meant that all of this fell onto the shoulders of co-workers. Because we had experience  in skill-sharing and working co-operatively  in the women's movement, we had to assume  the responsibility of training, without  having any decision-making power. However,  because attitudes and beliefs differed so  radically among the staff, new counsellors  were trained in a haphazard and inadequate  way. For example, some shifts would be  staffed by all inexperienced people whose  attitudes about rape and abuse crisis would  result in putting the blame on the teenagers  Consequently, we had the responsibility of  patching up the damage done by others in  abusive counseling situations.  Although the management had claimed to have  "Abused and confused teenagers  need to be surrounded by   non-judgemental, anti-sexist,  non-homophobic, anti-racist  adults, since most of the teenagers  are victims, and survivors of  society's prejudices and abuses."  a feminist perspective and initially described the Senator as a collective, there  were gross discrepancies between what they  said and what really happened. This became \  very clear by their lack of concern for a  variety of crucial issues.  There was strong reinforcement of the teenagers into traditional sex roles and a lack  of concern over the availability of pornography in the building. Unfortunately,  much of the pornography was brought into  the Senator by some male staff, in the form  of biker and heavy metal magazines, Playboy and Penthouse..  continued on p. 24 24 Kinesis May'83  OPINION  continued from p. 23  The five of us who resigned had a growing  concern over the staff's lack of ability  to understand the issue of pornography. One  of the residents was posing for pornographic  pictures. Yet some staff saw pornographic  materials as appropriate gifts for ex-residents. And some male staff continued to  read pornography while working.. Still no  one seemed to understand why we were upset.  After raising the issue at a couple of  staff meetings we organized a workshop on  pornography for the staff. In spite of the  workshop, many of the staff, as well as the  staff supervisor, were unable to make the  connections between prostitution, pornography, and child abuse.  "The ultimate irony of this situation", as  one of us has said, "is that abused and  confused teenagers need to be surrounded  by non-judgemental, anti-sexist, non-homophobic, anti-racist adults, .since most of  the teenagers are victims and survivors of  society's prejudices and abuses."  The only feedback that many staff got from  management was negative - whatever they  did. For example, on a typical shift, staff  handled a range of situations that often  included physical fights, drunk, stoned,  and abusive teenagers, hours of intensive  discussion and counseling, not to mention  the everyday maintenance of the hostel,  such as making beds, cleaning up, writing  in the log book, etc.  At any one time there could be up to thirty  kids in the building and two or three  staff. No matter how remarkably well some  staff dealt with all of this, it was only  when something went wrong that management  would respond. In fact, managment managed  to blame on-line staff for problems that  were completely out of the staff's control.  For example, the number of residents living  in the building depends on referrals from  social workers working for the MHR. However,  when the numbers were low, continual reference was made by the management that this  was the fault of the staff for not doing  their job properly.  Often when tensions were high it seemed  like management's response was to make someone's working conditions so intolerable  they had no choice but to leave. Ironically  these people were not forced out for challenging the Senator philosophy. They were  highly competent individuals who were  scape-goated for adhering to the so-called  philosophy and principles by which they  were hired.  Over the past two years, the list of  extremely competent staff who were fired  or who felt forced to leave include: John  Turvey, Claudia MacDonald, Sean Mayberry,  Rob Joyce, Ellen Connell, Colleen Walsh,  and Barry Gibbon. In fact, management actually forbid staff to mention some of these  people's names in the staff log, at meetings or in the office. And in many cases  there was no explanation given as to where  and why these people had gone. These staff  were all either open to a feminist analysis  or had already incorporated it into their  lives and work. And when we saw the same  process being directed at Connie Smith,  we decided to actively protest. We resigned.  Because there is no concrete hiring policy,  the staff profile has changed from its  eclectic beginnings. It is now predominately  apolitical males.  At the beginning, 50% of the staff were  gay - both women and men - now only one gay  man is left. At the beginning approximately  60% of the staff were men and 40% were women. Now 70% are men and 30% are women. At  the time of this writing, none of the women  are lesbians or identify as feminists.  Although we were told that reports given to  MHR claim a high success rate, it is our  personal experience that this is not so.  Teenagers who entered the .Senator and left  two years later, still had drug problems,  low self-esteem, and were still working  the street - despite the few good relationships they had with staff.  Only a few teenagers, through their positive  relationships with counselors were able to  change their lives and overcome the abuse  that society had dealt them.  Despite all of the problems at the Senator,  there were definately times when we felt  positive and optimistic. But this was mainly because- we had built up good relationships with the majority of the teenagers  who frequented or lived at the Senator.  And we continue to maintain some of those  relationships, even now.  Also, we supported each other throughout  our time at the Senator. And each one of us  acknowledges that without this support we  would not have stayed as long as we did.  We also acknowledge that this city desperately needs a facility for these jteenagers  that operates fully with a progressive  philosophy that is realized in practice.  This article was written by Barbara Isaac,  Marian Lydbrooke, Jannit Rabinovitch,  Connie Smith,  and Peggy Thompson.  continued from p. 17  SK: That's something you said  on the "Hang in There1! album.  HN: "Oh America," - yes, it's  amazing, and this tour with  Ronnie has been bringing folks  out of the woodwork.  SK: It must be exciting for you  to play with Ronnie, for your  sense of history, and artistically .  HN: It is historically exciting.  When I was ten I thought if I  ever got to see another concert  I'd be happy, because I saw her  perform back then, and never  dreamed I'd actually be working with her. Politically it's  exciting because I think we  symbolize things to people that  gives them7a past, a present  and a future - not necessarily  that the past is Ronnie and the  future is me, our working together combats that kind of  ageist response - and people  of all ages, you know, people  who grew up with Ronnie and  never heard me, older people  whose children have introduced  them to me but who come back  to hear Ronnie, so its crossing  over all kinds of stereotypes.  Artistically, its been a very  exciting challenge. I work  alone a lot of the time, I  mean I work with pianists and  I work with people at Redwood  and all of that, but vocally I  have been a soloist most of my  life. To share a show takes a  certain amount of alteration  on my part. It's not been hard  at all in terms of feeling  like I have to hold back or  be polite or in any way...oh  now it's Ronnie's turn, I  should lighten up here, or I'm  being too assertive or any of  that kind of stuff, because  she is such a craftswoman and  she is so talented and good  at what she does. I can sing  full voice and she can still  outsing me, you know, and  that's just wonderful. It's  hard when people get together  and they have to sort of walk  around on egg shells... that  doesn't exist with us...in  terms of artistry I don't ever"  feel like there are any restraints. .. ^?tlb4  The foursome is a very high  craft experience for me, I  feel like I am working with  people who are really the top  of their field. It continues  to be wonderful to work with  Susan; and Jeff and I worked  together so long when we were  kids. Even after, I guess it's  seven years or something like  that since we worked together,  we sit down at the piano or  rehearsal and it's there - we  have a language that got instilled in our early develop-:  ment and never goes away, so  it's a delight to work with  him.  Susan continues to grow as an  interpreter. She's taken a  real strong leadership position in seeing that hearing  people's consciousness gets  raised as well as working with  deaf people to find out what's  the most useful to them. We  don't want to be just a bunch  of hearing people out there  thinking we're being so good  by doing something that ends  up not being useful.  SK: I have to ask you about  Adrienne.  HN: She's working in San Francisco. The next time I run  into her is at a women's music  festival in Bloomington, Indiana. She's playing for Linda  Tillery at that. She's also  been working with a woman from  Oregon, Lisa Koch. So she's  been working with other singers and I think she's fine...  I think it's important for  people like Ady to work with  other singers, you know you  can get locked into a stuck  place. Musicians need to develop their independence from  just being someone's accompanist. I think it's good.  HN: I guess I feel like feminists right now are feeling a  little bit of growing pains".  We were an independent, and  in some cases, an isolated or  separate movement. As we got  our feet on the ground we  moved into what is sometimes  called mainstream. We had to  deal with the fact that although there was bliss in the  newness of the new wave of the  women's movement - because  obviously feminism has been  around for a long time - but  there was that new energy  that maybe got some people  kind of spoiled. It's like  when a woman first comes out,  there's an energy that just  can't be described, or when a  woman first discovers that she  has a personality apart from  her father or-her husband...but  that energy doesn't sustain and  it eventually has to move into  everyday life.  We're all moving out into these  different places and affecting  other people, and also giving  ourselves time to challenge  other things in our lives. Like,  for example, in my own life I  need to work on the well-taught  racist attitudes that even  children get, even people who  are trying very hard not to be  racist have these attitudes to  deal with; and our international perspectives, and wanting  to deal with people who are in  prison in Latin America; there's  a million things to deal with.  But, once you experience that  feeling of independence, if  you continue to get support,  that experience doesn't go  away. It's there in you. It's  how you walk around, whether  you have a stop sexism button  or not. What do you have on?  (lesbians, no nukes) Yeah,  right! Whether you wear those  or not, the feminist or the  lesbian feminist or the activist in you is there. We move  through the world carrying all  'of that. I haven't got to a  place where I can articulate  it very well, but I sense  some women being a little worried about what's happening  with the women's movement. The  women's movement is alive and  well. We're just integrating  ourselves into, all of the progressive movements in the world. May'83 Kinesis 25  LETTERS  Feminist shares  working views  Kinesis:  I am writing to share some things I've  learned about working together for personal,  social and political change. Most of these  lessons came through the difficult process  of not getting the results I wanted in my  work with the women's movement. The times I  didn't feel effective, unified, clear, satisfied, powerful or hopeful taught me a  great deal.  I made a lot of mistakes in my approach and  actions,.especially in my manner of dealing  with the. issue of rape, both in my experience and in my relation to other feminists  about this. I learned that acting from fear,  anger, bitterness, mistrust and a position  of blame just didn't work to get me what I  wanted. As understandable as those reactions  were, it was reacting which kept me out of  control.  I wanted to heal my experience of violation,  point put contradictions within our movement and make a contribution to women's  strength and safety. I wanted to feel empowered, safe, at peace, trusting, sane,  credible and respected. At this point, years  down the road, I am succeeding in doing  these things and feeling these ways. Along  the line I let a lot get in my way. My intention in writing is to encourage you to  avoid the long road of mistakes I have made  and to build on my experience.  Here are some of the mistakes:  1. losing sight of our common purpose and  shared goals, allowing my smaller concerns  to come first.  2. wanting to be right/justified/correct and  make everybody else wrong/unjustified/incorrect and so denying myself the value of  learning from others.  3. thinking that revenge would get me what  I wanted. I learned that getting even  doesn't work.  4. being more interested in fixing the blame  that in fixing the problem.  5. assuming I already knew and understood  the other person's point of view without  asking her or him.  6. taking an initial position of mistrust;  assuming that I would not be treated with  respect, that I would not be told the truth,  that 'they' were against me. This was self-  fulfilling. It left me no room to find out  otherwise.  7. taking second hand information as 'the  Truth', not bothering to find out first  hand, being afraid to approach or question  those with different points of view.  8. hiding my agenda, being dishonest about  my intentions for fear I might be vulnerable, look bad or not get what I wanted.  9. fooling myself about the consequences of  my actions, especially in believing that  confronting others would force them to  change their minds when it predictably resulted in entrenchment and counter-attack.  10. putting the problem out there in "society" and feeling too small and powerless  to do anything about it, using this as an  excuse for inaction.  Here is the corresponding list of approaches  that are working for me in building strong  unity based on accountability, cooperation,  and respect for each person's life:  1. acting consistently with my overall purpose, holding in mind our shared goals,  letting unity and community be important  not just in words but in practice.  2. being willing to be wrong, seeing a  different point of view and simply changing  positions, learning from my mistakes without putting down myself or others.  3. taking a win/win approach, only accepting  solutions where everyone gains, acting from  the co-operative spirit I say I believe in.  4. solving the problem, letting fault and  blame be irrelevant  &A  5. listening with an open mind to the otner  person's point of view with a willingness to  see from her or his perspective.,  6. assuming a position of trust, doing what  I'd like you to do with me. I don't want to  have to 'prove' I'm worthy of trust. Giving  you my trust is the best way for me to receive yours. Trusting myself is the key. .  7. going directly to the source; forming  my own opinions and judgements, not taking  on someone else's.  8. being honest about my hidden agenda,  especially being honest with myself, getting  what I really want by risking being clear  and open about what that is.  9. taking an honest look at the actual results of what I say and do; if it's working  in the way I want, great, if not, taking a  different course of action.  10. starting at home, seeing the contradiction within my own life, owning my power,  determining to change the problem as it  appears right here, persisting until I succeed.  Acting consistently with my ideals is the  essence. I know I will fall short of this  and make mistakes again. And I know that  stating my principles clearly and publically  supports me in living by them. One way you  might draw on my experience is by writing  your own list - individually or with your  group. Principles of unity become more than  words of advice when we put them into action  This takes honest and consistent effort.  Isn't building the kind of world we want to  live in worth it?  I give my thanks to each of you who supported me in this learning and to Krin, Lorraine  and Isobel of the Radical Therapy Collective  for encouraging me to write this letter.  Cyndia Cole  Women's shelter  to provide refuge  Kinesis:  The Vancouver Women's Shelter Society is  forming in order to create a refuge intended  to provide support and a home to street women. Many of these women have, been involved  in the criminal justice system and often  find themselves at risk as they struggle to  survive. We plan to establish a safe place  that would provide housing, food, emotional  support and a variety of services aimed at  encouraging and helping them to find alternate ways to survive that are safer and  healthier than those they've established.  We are approaching the City of Vancouver  and CMHC in hopes of acquiring a building  that we can renovate to suit our needs.  Ideally we envision housing for twenty to  thirty women including some emergency beds  as well as several shared spaces available  to both residents and other street women  alike. These might include a cafeteria,  lounges, a library, a small gym, quiet  rooms, a craft area, laundry facilities,  etc.  Follow-up with the individual women who use  the services will help us to develop and  change resources to meet the needs of the  population we are serving;  As we are in a formative stage, we realize  that we are writing a bit prematurely. However, we wish to be included in your issue on prostitution as we hope that our  service will offer viable aternatives to  street women, many of whom are involved in  prostitution. You will be hearing more from  us as we progress.  Interested women are welcomed to contact us  c/o The Women's Bookstore, 322 West Hasting;  Street, Vancouver, V6B 1K6.  The Women's Shelter Society  Conference  committee  resolves dispute  Kinesis:  The purpose in writing this letter is to  clarify the issues which were raised within  the 1983 B.C. Regional Lesbian Conference  Organizing Committee in February. We are  writing this letter to inform the women's  community about the controversy and how it  was resolved.  The controversy arose when the committee  discovered that the poster which had been  designed and typeset for the Lesbian Conference in May had been done at a struck-  shop, the Typex Graphics Ltd. The labour  for the poster had been done voluntarily  and without remuneration to a woman who  wished to contribute to the conference and  who worked at the Typex Graphics Ltd.  A division occurred within the organizing  committee when we were faced with having  to make a decision about whether or not to  proceed with using the work already done  by the employee of the Typex Graphics Ltd.  Committee members not infavour of using the  poster argued that to use the materials  and labour of a shop that had been declared  hot for two years would be strike-breaking,  Such an action was seen as breaking solidarity with the labour movement which has  advanced the rights and increased the benefits for women workers. Several unions  have, for example, worked to have employers  upgrade and provide training for women in  all areas, especially those that have been  affected by technological change. Unions  have negotiated for inclusion of clauses  on sexual harassment, initiated grievance  procedures on sexual harassment, and negotiated clauses prohibiting discrimination  on the basis of sexual orientation.  Several women on the committee believed  that by using the work of a woman working  in a struck-shop we would, in essence, be  crossing a picket line. And all the good  intentions in the world would not change  this fact. Women on the committee also  stated they valued the work done by women  active in the labour movement and did not  want to risk alienating these women or  undermining their hard work. We were also  fearful that by crossing a picket line, we  would be seen as having allied with management. And crossing a picket line would  not be a useful tactic even if the union  was not concretely working to ensure equal  working conditions for its female workers.  For all these reasons, many of us argued  not to ~use the poster already near completion.  The Committee members who were in favour  of continuing on with the poster argued on  the basis of information received from the  woman working at the company which was being, picketed, that the Graphic Arts International Union, Local 210 was "anti-women".  Women had heard that the union was negating its responsibility in working to upgrade the position of its women members  by creating another, lower paid job category which would effectively ghettoize fe- 26 Kinesis May '83  LETTERS  male graphic artists in this lower paid  category.  Committee members in favour of using the  poster argued that supporting unions unconditionally was a mistake and presented  a strong position as to why not to support  a union unconditionally. Unions were, for  the most part, seen as male-oriented and  patriarchal. The Typex Graphic Ltd. had  supported the woman who did the poster.  Also, the company had attempted to negotiate several times with the union in good  faith but the negotiations had broken down.  It was important to some women that we  judge each union/management conflict situ-  ationally and not assume that the company  involved was acting unfairly, or was at  fault. Women also believed that the conference committee had not, at least,  technically crossed any picket line because the labour and ideas for the poster  had been offered to us by an individual  woman who happened to work at a struck-  shop and not by the company.  A decision was not reached until a month  after the controversy arose. A core committee organizing for the conference had  agreed in October to make decisions by  consensus. When we realized that we had  reached an impasse and yet wanted to have  a poster for publicity and outreach purposes, we decided to change the agreement  about consensus decision making and make  the decision by the majority vote. However,  when a vote was taken, ho formal majority  position was reached.  Therefore, women who had voted to use the  poster agreed, to disagree with the final  decision and move with the "majority" decision which was not to use the poster done  at the company. In addition, a conciliatory  approach was taken when a friendly amendment was proposed, that being that specific  actions would be taken to ensure that the  "minorities" views would be represented  outside the committee by sending a letter  to the union questioning their work in  support of women graphic artists and a letter to Kinesis would be written.  Committee members felt excited about the  process that the committee had worked  through in order to finally make a decision.  The consequences were that women working  on the committee were able to maintain  whatever position they had chosen to take  and still have enough good-will and respect  for another woman's views.  1983 B.C. Regional Lesbian Conference  Committee  What follows is the letter sent to the  Graphic Arts International Union,  Local 210  from the B.C.  Regional Lesbian Conference  Committee.  We want you to know that we are supporting  the current strike at Typex Graphics Ltd.  by not dealing with a shop that's declared  hot because we support the solidarity of  unions.  However, we would like to know what your  union is doing to commit employers to upgrade and provide training for women in all  aceas, especially those that have been  affected by technological changes. What is  your bargaining strategy for negotiating a  clause on sexual harassment? What is your  unions policy for initiating grievance procedures on sexual harassment? Have you organized non-sexist seminars for your shop  stewards? And have you negotiated a clause  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation in any of your present  union contracts? If not, why not?  We, as working women, think these issues  are important for the betterment of the  labour force and all working people. We  want unions to continue to push for the  equality of women by visibly including the  above stated conditions in any and all new  contracts.  Without such actiorj, we think the union is  not representative of all the workers.  Prostitution  is a women's issue  We are writing this letter to Kinesis as we  do not have a contact address for the organizing committee of IWD.  We are outraged, that as Canada's only "prostitutes rights" group, we were not invited  to lead a workshop let alone set up an information table.  At present, we are the only group anywhere  that we know of that publishes a bi-monthly  list of "bad tricks" and have proof-that  this strategy is very effective.  Is the plight of prostitutes not to be considered a women's issue? Prostitute women  are among the most vulnerable of all women.  Daily they are subjected to brutal beatings,  custody battles, rape, harassment and murders. And the perpetrators are not only the  tricks but society at large, because of the'  prostitutes outlaw status.  So, in light of the fact that IWD's theme  was hard times and every day we see more  women going back to the streets and many  more turning out because of "hard times"  we think it negligent that we were not invited.  Pornography CANNOT be fully addressed until  prostitution is addressed. Keep in mind the  same women work in both industries and that  pornography is the printed end of prostitution that is being pimped.  We see a need for a concrete feminist analysis on this issue and we see it as long  overdue.
