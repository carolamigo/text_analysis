Women of  colour  workshop  The Unlearning Racism Workshop Planning Committee is holding a workshop for  women of colour only on the weekend of  September 8, 9, 10, 1989 at Camp Alexandra, White Rock. The theme of the workshop will be Eliminating Hopelessness: Understanding Disappointments.  The workshop structure will focus on the  barriers that we as diverse groups of women  face in our struggle against racism. Some of  the barriers to solidarity are: internalized  sexism, internalized racism, racism, and  intraracism (misinformation about other  women of colour). The facilitator will be  Gloria Yamato from Seattle, Washington  who has done a number of workshops on  racism both in Vancouver and elsewhere.  Ms. Yamato is of African-American heritage, feminist, and is the founder of a foundation in Seattle that deals with issues of diversity.

At an Awards of Merit Celebration, June 9th, 7 pm, at Vancouver's  Hycroft Manor this year's nominated radio and television winning entrants will be  announced and publicly acknowledged. The  Awards of Merit cite progress made by  Canadian advertisers, producers and broadcasters in their depiction of women and  girls. The jury, responsible for screening and  selection, represents academic, professional  and community interests. The awards, first  presented in 1987, raise awareness that improvements are being seen and heard, and  applaud those who have helped create and  promote more and better programs for,  about and by women.  MediaWatch also recognizes two women  for outstanding achievements in the field  of communications. These awards, named  after pioneer broadcaster Dodi Robb, this  year honour Barbara Janes and Gertrude J.  Robinson for their contributions and commitment to the promotion of the status and  image of women.  Dr. Robinson, an accomplished scholar,  teacher and Graham Spry Prize recipient,  directs McGill University's Graduate Program in Communications and is the author  of several submissions to the CRTC about  the representation of women in broadcast  media. She has a particular interest in employment equity. Barbara Janes, originally  from Newfoundland, heads Vancouver's National Film Board's Pacific Centre. A former University teacher, Barbara distinguished herself as a NFB producer. Film  credits include "Doctor, Lawyer, Indian  Chief." In 1987, she helped set up Vancouver Women in Film and Video, and currently serves on the Board of Directors.  A reception and entertainment are part  of the events for the celebration-minded  crowd. All are invited. For information and  tickets call 731-0457. For more information  about MediaWatch write #250-1820 Fir St.,  Vancouver, B.C. V6J 3B1  Edmonton  film festival  IN-Sight '89 organizers have begun their  search for the best in Canadian film and  video—produced, directed or written by  women. The second annual Women's Film  and Video Festival will be held in Edmonton October 12-15.  In celebration of Canadian works, IN-  Sight '89 will showcase work by some of  Canada's most prominent women filmmakers. Negotiations are underway to include  work by such directors as: Anne Wheeler  (Bye Bye Blues, Cowboys Don't Cry);  Leah Pool (Straight to the Heart); Sandy  Wilson (My American Cousin) and Lulu  Keating (The Midday Sun). The festival  will again include an eclectic selection of  films and videos representing all genres and  many points of view.  Based on the success of the first festival in 1988, a conference will also be held  in conjunction with this year's event. Participants will have the opportunity to attend workshops and hosted screenings with  women from a broad cross-section of the local and national film and video industry.  Organizers have now placed their call for  submissions in search of work that provides  regional perspectives of Canadian women  or which offer insight into the lives of  "marginalized" women from ethnic, cultural  or social minorities.

Yes indeed, glasnost has hit the  Kinesis Editorial Board and we're presenting it to you with a feminist slant. We can't  say whether this month's length will be par  for the course. Probably, if we sense any interest at all, we'll just go on and on, longer  each month.  The month of May heard a lot of goodbyes and hellos around the Kinesis /VSW  offices. After four excellent years as editor,  Esther Shannon packed up her desk and  moved it down the hall, beginning a stint  as VSW administrator.  In 1985, we first met Esther as she  grabbed a sledgehammer and began tearing down walls in the Kinesis office—a figurative statement hinting at the powerful  changes she'd be bringing to the paper.  We're sorry to see Esther leave, but  look forward to still having her close by-  wearing a new hat and sizing up different  walls.  Welcome to Nancy Pollak who, as new  editor, will be putting a fresh stamp on a  stalwart product. Nancy's been around the  paper as a volunteer, grant worker, editorial board member, and interim editor. We  looking forward to watching Kinesis grow  with her guidance.  And another goodbye—this time to Cat  L'Hirondelle, VSW administrator with a  twelve year record of extraordinary achievement. More than anyone, Cat deserves  thanks for actually getting Kinesis into  your home each month—she's been sticking  on labels and updating mailing hsts since  Kinesis was a two page VSW newsletter—  and for paying our bills. Not to mention  keeping an eagle eye on Kinesis costs and  income, paying our bills, answering our  mail,...  A temporary 'goodbye' to Allisa McDonald, who's taking a few months rest from the  editorial board but promises to "be a phone  call away" if we need her. Don't move too  far from that phone Allisa, but nap between  calls.  And as readers may notice from the advertisement for a Production Co-ordinator  in this issue, after the July/August issue  we'll be bidding farewell to Marsha Arbour,  our Production Co-ordinator. (We want to  make sure Marsha gets a special spotlight  for her good-bye so more on that next issue.)  That's it for hello/goodbyes, now onto  changes which don't require hand-waving.  In March, the Kinesis Editorial Board  met with Vancouver's Women of Colour  group, for an invaluable discussion on ways  we can all work more closely together. This  meeting was part of an ongoing look at how  Kinesis can incorporate an anti-racist perspective and be inclusive of women's experience. A future column will explore our process in more detail.  One of the results of our meeting with  the Women of Colour group was our recognition that many women who read the paper, and may want to volunteer at Kinesis  need more information about how the paper  works. As part of our effort to make the paper more accessible and more accountable,  we are holding an Open House on June 5th  to show readers and potential volunteers,  how we operate. (See Bulletin Board for details.)  We've also put many hours of work into  a 'volunteer kit' which includes a Kinesis  history, a writer's style guide, a production  glossary and other useful material to orient  and inform new volunteers. Write us if you  want a copy, or drop by the office to take a  look. Most importantly, come volunteer!  Bad federal budget news trickled down to  Kinesis/YSW in the form of a fifteen percent budget cut (see story page three). This  cut from the Secretary of State's Women's  Program is bound to have serious negative  effects on VSW, already a severely underfinanced organization.  The second cut, one with a particular effect on Kinesis also arrived via that Ottawa bluster. The government decided to  drastically cut its contribution to the periodical postal subsidy program. This program allows Canadian magazines to mail to  subscribers at reduced rates, a critical subsidy to many small newspapers and magazines.  "If Canada Post does not offset the subsidy reductions by cutting costs, the implications for Canadian magazines may be serious indeed. Postal rates might increase, or  some Canadian magazines might be denied  the subsidy in future," says our national distributor, the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association.  Well keep you posted on the effects of  both these cuts.  And to end on a more encouraging note—  enjoy your June Kinesis and keep those  cards, letters and subscriptions coming in.  -..MflftTH VAN.-?:£/••  CROSSLAND CONSULTING  Personal Management  Services for Artists  * FIRST CONSULTATION FREE*  Jackie Crossland  By Appointment Only 682-3109  Apology  Our apologies to writer, Kim Irving and  to Jessica Gossen, a Vancouver lawyer who  acted as an important source for Kim's article "Young offenders act to be revised,"  which appeared in our June issue.

KINESIS yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  ////////////////////^^^^^  ///////////////////^^^^  News  Services in peril  by Nancy Pollak  While few Canadians escaped  Ottawa's budget blast of new taxes  and shrivelled social programs,  barely a peep was heard about  cuts that will profoundly affect  women's self-help organizations.  The federal Department of the  Secretary of State (Sec State) is  lopping millions of dollars from its  funds to various programs, including a loss of $2 million this fiscal  year to the Women's Program.  Women's groups across British Columbia and Canada are already feehng the knife. While still  awaiting definite information from  Sec State, groups with operational  funding are dealing with a 15 percent cut this year.  Next year, the cuts will be even  greater.  By March 1990, targeted women's groups — if they survive —  will have endured a 33 percent  funding cut.  In B.C., the groups include  the Vancouver Status of Women  (VSW), Victoria Status of Women  Action Group (SWAG), numerous  rural and urban women's centres,  Media Watch and the Women's  Research Centre. Kinesis is published by VSW.  Nationally, the National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC) was struck with a  50 percent cut by 1991-92. An umbrella organization with over 600  member groups, NAC is widely be  heved to be the victim of a vindictive Conservative government,  angered by the feminist anti-Free  Trade movement last election.  "We view [the cut] as a retaliatory measure," says NAC president Lynn Kay, "because we have  fought to hold this and every other  government to its commitments  to end all forms of discrimination  against women, and because we  have been doing the job we are  supposed to do — monitor and  criticize government pohcy from  this point of view."  (NAC and other national  groups have launched a feisty  budget fight-back starting June  4th. See below for details.)  Please see Peril page 4  NAC organizes despite cuts  by Janet Berry  Between May 12 and May 15,  several hundred women gathered  in Ottawa for the annual general meeting of the National Action Committee of the Status of  Women (NAC). It was the 17th  annual general meeting of the feminist organization which is comprised of 589 member groups.  NAC hopes to break the 600 mark  this year. Like many other feminist  organizations and groups, NAC's  funding from Secretary of State  has been reduced by 15 percent for  this year with further reductions  in two years bringing the cut to 50  percent of last year's funding level  by the end of two years.  NAC's budget for the current  year reflects this cut and the need  for fiscal spending restraints. In  keeping with the spirit of changes  as reflected in the organizational  review that NAC has undertaken,  the budget was brought forward  at the AGM for the delegates to  discuss. This was but one of the  proposals by the organizational review committee.  Another area concerning the  Organizational Review Committee  (ORC), was the technical attitudi-  nal and economic barriers to access to NAC. As the ORC stated  they "have been concerned with  encouraging the growing diversity  of our membership, eliminating  barriers to full participation and  integrating the issues and concerns  of women who have been previously marginal to the organization."  A good objective, however much  work lies ahead for NAC to achieve  these goals. During discussion on  the organizational review there  was much said by women of colour  on the internal systemic barriers  within NAC. Women from NAC's  Visible Minority and Immigrant  Women's Committee had met with  the NAC executive to press for action on integration. The outcome  of this meeting was a recommendation from NAC's executive that an  Ad Hoc Affirmative Action Committee be struck "to develop objectives for and plans of action to  integrate the concerns and issues  of minority women's groups into  all levels of NAC's decision making and activities."  The Ad Hoc Affirmative Action  Committee received the support of  the delegates in attendance. This  committee is to report back to the  executive in September 1989.  The theme of this year's AGM  was "Women for Social Solidarity." Rosamaria Ruiz, a feminist  from Bolivia, was the keynote  speaker at the plenary session.  Ruiz told of the poverty of Latin  American women and of their  struggle for a decent hfe. She spoke  of the global economy and the connection between the wealthy nations and the exploitative conditions of workers in Latin and Central America.  One of the most moving presentations occurred during the workshop on ecofeminism. The story of  the Innu people of the Nitassinan  land (the Labrador-Quebec peninsula) was eloquently told by Rose  Gregorie, an Innu woman. She and  two other Innu women were at  the AGM. Their women's group,  in the village of Sheshatshit, is a  member group of NAC. Rose Gregorie spoke of the destruction of  the Innu way of hfe. Canada is expanding its military base at Goose  Bay, Labrador, and is using Innu  land for bombing practice and low  level flights of military jets training to avoid radar.  Rose Gregorie spoke of a people proud of their culture and with  an independent way of hfe becoming a people with no self-respect,  no sense of control over their own  destinies. For 25 years the oppression of Innu people has been occurring, with the increased military  presence this destruction of a people has escalated. Rose Gregorie  worded it so well when she said  "we feel that we have been shoved  to the edge of a cliff in the last 25  years. Now they want to push us  over." The Innu women received  a standing ovation from the other  delegates at NAC when Rose Gregorie read their statement. (See  page 10 for the full text of the Innu  women's statement.)  The staff of NAC is now unionized. This past year the executive recognized the Canadian  Union of Pubhc Employees as the  bargaining agent for the permanent staff. A first collective agreement has been reached. A union/  management committee has been  developed to further the aims  of embodying feminist principles  in the staff/management relationship.  The annual NAC lobby of the  pohtical parties took place on the  last day of the AGM. The Liberals and the New Democrats attended. The Progressive Conservatives refused to attend the lobby.  In their place a "street theatre"  took place in the lobby room. Several women formed an interim government while the current government was "in hiding." It was a  clever piece of theatre, as there  were co-prime ministers, a minister of peace, a minister of wealth  redistribution, a minister of well-  being, and a few others. Questions  put to the Liberals and the New  Democrats were also put to this  "interim government."  There was much discussion at  this AGM on the recent federal  budget. NAC plans to work with  other groups to expose this budget  for what it is: a free-trade budget,  that will cause great hardships for  low income Canadians, the majority of whom are women. (See budget cuts story this page.)  Ruling major victory for women  by Jackie Brown  In a unanimous decision, the  Supreme Court of Canada has  ruled that discrimination on the  basis of pregnancy is discrimination on the basis of sex.  The discrimination is particularly significant because it quashes  the court's own 1979 ruhng in the  Stella Bliss case which concluded  the opposite. In Bhss, the court  said pregnant women could be discriminated against because the basis for the discrimination was their  pregnancy—not that they were  women. The ruhng allowed the  limitation of unemployment insurance pregnancy benefits, although  the federal government has since  revised its pohcy in that area.  The latest decision involved  three part-time cashiers who worked for Manitoba Canada Safeway  stores in 1982. In overturning a  Manitoba Court of Appeal ruhng,  the Supreme Court said Canada  Safeway's company employee benefit program discriminated against  the pregnant women because it  excluded payment of accident or  sickness benefits to them for a 17  week period. Canada Safeway argued that the exclusion was not  discrimination but rather, a decision to compensate some risks and  not others.  But the court tossed out the argument, stating that pregnancy is  a valid, health-related reason for  leaving work and may not be singled out for disadvantageous treatment. The court also said that  pregnancy discrimination is a form  of sex discrimination because only  women become pregnant.  "Pregnancy discrimination is a  form of sex discrimination simply because of the basic biological fact that only women have  the capacity to become pregnant,"  wrote Chief Justice Brian Dickson. "Those who bear children and  benefit society as a whole should  not be economically or socially disadvantaged. It is thus unfair to impose all of the costs of pregnancy  on one-half of the population."  Victoria Gray, president of the  West Coast Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF),  said the decision sends a clear message to employers: "Exclusion is  chsCTiminatory," said Gray, noting  that the case has added significance because the court admitted  it was wrong in its judgment of the  Stella Bliss case. "It is very unusual for the Supreme Court to say  it made a mistake," she said.  Gray added that the overturning of one of its own rulings could  have been a factor in the length  of time it took to decide the case  (heard in June, 1988) because the  court may have needed the time to  consider all the implications.  Justice Dickson has stated that  Bliss was wrongly decided or at  least, would not be decided now as  it was then. He also said a decade  of hindsight and profound changes  were factors in the ruhng.  The ruhng marks the end of a  six-year battle for Susan Brooks,  Patricia Allen and Patricia Dixon,  who saw their claim of discrimination rejected by the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench and  the Manitoba Court of Appeal.  But, while the Supreme Court  decision comes down strongly in  favour of pregnant women, the  court  also stated  that  Canada  Safeway may have been able to  make a distinction along sex lines  in its employee benefit plan had  regulations to that effect been included in the Manitoba Human  Rights Act. Canada Safeway had  argued that regulations in the Unemployment Insurance and Manitoba Human Rights acts allowed  the distinction. The court did not  agree with that interpretation.  According to Gray, provincial  legislators could attempt to include such distinctions in human  rights acts because the charter  of Rights and Freedoms refers to  "such reasonable limits prescribed  by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." Thus in some cases a provision might be discriminatory but  not unreasonable, Gray says.  She adds, however, that the language of the Supreme Court is  "very strong" and any such attempt by a legislator would be  seen as discriminatory on the basis of pregnancy or sex and open  to challenge under the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms.  KINESIS ACROSS B.C.  \XXXXXX\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX''  .XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXNN\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXN^\X\XXNX>X\X  NS**^^**Sxxxxxx^^  Deaf people  launch revolution  by Kim Irving  Throughout the following article, the word Deaf, usually  spelled with a small 'd', has  been capitialized. According to  Patricia Shores-Hermann, a  respected Deaf activist from  Ontario, "Culturally Deaf people expect that a capital 'D' be  used when referring to them,  just as capitals are used when  other cultural groups are referred to such as Chinese people, Natives, Polish people."  Shores-Hermann explains that  a significant core of Deaf people, especially younger community activists, have come to  view themselves first and foremost as members of a distinct  linguistic and cultural minority, the culturally Deaf. Members of this culture have their  own customs, values, social  norms and traditions. Source:  Vibrations  For the first time in Canadian  history, Deaf rights demonstrations were held across the country on May 12. This day of protest  and celebration, attended by more  than 250 Deaf people and their  hearing supporters in downtown  Vancouver, was in recognition of  a National Deaf Education Day.  Many have declared these protests  to be the birth of the Deaf rights  movement in Canada.  Speakers at the rally included  the president of the Canadian  Association for the Deaf, teachers and students from Vancouver's  Jericho HUI School for the Deaf  and concerned parents. The protesters wanted equal rights to education as guaranteed to them in  the Charter of Rights.  The four main demands were:  • to keep Deaf schools open;  • the integration of American  Sign Language (ASL), Lalangue  des Signes du Quebec (LSQ)  and Maritime Sign Language  (MSL) into the education of the  Deaf;  • an increase in Deaf teachers and  administrators and  • the establishment of a B.C. policy board to oversee decisions  regarding Deaf education which  would have a membership of 51  percent Deaf persons.  A great concern for many of  the protesters was the recent proposal from the B.C. Ministry of  Education to relocate Jericho Hill  School to Burnaby, as a means of  integrating Deaf and hearing students. This type of move, which  has threatened many Deaf schools  across Canada, is seen by educators, as providing better education  opportunities to Deaf people.  However, the move to integration has upset past graduates of Jericho, and their families,  who spoke of their fondness for  the community and culture that  has been developed in Jericho's  67 year history. Present students  agreed and warned that integration could only mean a loss of self-  worth and self-identification.  "We don't feel embarrassed  about who we are," signed Kam-  lash Ram, a representative of Jericho Student Council. "We have  pride in our deafness. We learn  about famous Deaf people. We  learn about Deaf culture. We learn  sign language. We can communicate freely at Jericho."  Karen Carruthers, a Deaf teacher and mother, criticized the  lack of Deaf participation in the  Jericho decision. "How many people in these discussions are Deaf?  Hearing people are the pohcy makers!"  Native speaker Len George, father of a Deaf child, equated the  oppression of Deaf people to Native oppression. George explained  how Native people lost their culture and language through forced  integration.  "No matter how much they try  to integrate us," he said, "we will  always be Native. They may try to  integrate the Deaf, but you will always be Deaf."  Students also complained about  interpreters in integrated settings,  such as those for Deaf students  who attend Kitsilano High School.  Hearing sign interpreters often  break confidentiality by reporting  Deaf students private conversations and sign with a rigidity that  is difficult to understand, the students say.  Almost as hot as the integration  debate is the issue of what kind of  sign language is to be used in Deaf  schools. In early days of education  for Deaf students, sign language  was condemned and students were  expected to learn to read lips or  speak. Few Deaf people were capable of fdfilling such expectations.  Shortly after, the sign language  most commonly used by Deaf people was accepted for educational  training.  Presently, most Deaf schools  in Canada, including Jericho, use  modified forms of Deaf sign language called Signed Enghsh, Seeing Essential Enghsh, or Seeing  Exact Enghsh (SEE). All these  forms operate as a visual interpretation of the Enghsh language and  Peril from page 3  Retaliatory or not, women's  groups have been caught in the  Tory deficit-driven cross-fire. Says  Sally Mackenzie of the Nelson  Women's Centre, "Their intent is  to cut back all funding to all  groups that are a thorn in their  side. The deficit gives them an economic rationale that allows them  to carry out a pohtical agenda."  VSW's Trisha Joel echoes Mackenzie's words. "With these cuts,  we won't be able to maintain our  level of response to attacks on daycare, universality, social services  ... This is a corporate agenda."  Along with the Women's Program, certain Native and multicultural programs have been cut.  The cuts are specifically aimed  at groups' "administrative overhead," which translates directly  into staff salaries. (VSW, for instance, has been forced to leave vacant their Information Officer position for lack of funds.) There  have been no cuts to Sec State's  bureaucracy.  The Terrace Women's Resource  Centre exemplifies what smaller  women's centres are facing. With  no clear word from the government, they have so far received  only 35 percent (rather than the  usual 50 percent) of their meager $36,200 annual grant, a grant  which   hasn't   changed  in   four  years.  "We can't do anything, we can't  plan," says part-time worker Can-  dace Kerman. Kerman and her coworker are paid on a 24 hr/wk basis — and work around 40 hours  each. Like other centres, Terrace  has low overhead (the city rents  them a house for $l/yr) so staff  and programming is all they can  cut.  "They [Sec State] give money  that's just enough to keep you going and not enough so you can  do anything," says Kerman. The  centre tries to work cooperatively  with other community groups on  programming, doing the legwork  ("women's work," observes Kerman) because the expenses, such  as the $400 airfare to Terrace, are  simply too much.  Victoria's SWAG hasn't even  had confirmation of their 1989-90  grant and are surviving on a small  surplus from last year's programming. New staffer Marianne Alto  works with a solid core of volunteers who, as in all centres, represent life-blood.  They have been meeting with  a Sec State-sponsored private consultant who warned them of "a  major disaster," says Alto. "The  government is going to pull out  completely." SWAG is moving to  wards private funding sources —  the province is "a joke," says Alto  — with trepidation.  With the funding pool shrinking, several groups expressed concerns about being played off  against one another. The Vancouver Society on Immigrant  Women was told its funding is secure because they represent a "priority group." Member Khatun Siddiqi, while recognizing the special needs of immigrant and other  women, doesn't hke the 'immigrant vs. mainstream' model of dividing people.  "We're being set up, one against  the other ... and it's part and  parcel of how we're all divided.  Women's issues are global and interrelated and we need support  from each other."  Let the Secretary of State  Gerry Weiner know what you  think of the cuts by writing  him: House of Commons, Ottawa Ont. KlA OA6.

For the first time in Canadian history, Deaf rights demonstrations were  held across the country.  are used to increase the Deaf student's knowledge of Enghsh.  Unhke SEE, American Sign  Language (ASL) was created by a  Deaf person, for Deaf people. ASL  originates from French Sign Language and was brought to North  America by Thomas Hopkins Gal-  laudet, in the early 19th century.  It has only been in the past decade  that ASL has been recognized as a  Deaf language in some areas of the  United States. In Canada, Manitoba has been the only province to  accept ASL. "Signed Enghsh is an  artificial code," stated Carruthers,  "invented by hearing people, for  hearing people."  Hearing educators seem not  to understand the relationship of  ASL to Deaf culture. They consider ASL to be an inferior form  of communication and attribute its  use to the low grades many Deaf  students receive.  For example, the Enghsh sentence, 'I do not hke that at all,'  would be translated quite literally  in SEE as T-'don't like'-'that'-  'at all'. An ASL interpretation of  the same sentence would be: "hke  zero." However, ASL incorporates  facial and body language and, hke  any foreign language, has its own  grammar and syntax. Contrary to  popular behef, ASL is not internationally used, but is used by over  five million people in North America.  Deaf educators argue that ASL  is not an alternative but a natural communication of the Deaf  culture. This is supported by Dr.  Laura Petitto of McGill University  whose recent studies indicate Deaf  children begin signing at the same  age as hearing children begin to  speak. Deaf educators would prefer that Deaf children were taught  ASL in their early education, to establish a relation to their Deaf culture and that Signed Enghsh be  introduced later as a second language.   In February of this year, students at the Deaf school in Atlantic Canada boycotted classes as  teachers were not using sign language. Of the 45 teachers at the  Resource Centre for the Hearing  Handicapped, only three teachers  know how to sign. Students there  referred to this as "linguistic chauvinism."  This type of student protest is  similar to that which took place  last spring at Gallaudet University in Washington D.C. There,  students barricaded the school for  four days, eventually ousting the  hearing, non-signing Dean. The  departing Dean was replaced with  one who was deaf. The Gallaudet  riots have been referred to by some  as the beginning of the Deaf revolution.  However complicated the debate, illiteracy seems to plague the  Deaf community. Of the 30,000  Deaf people in Canada (5,000 in  B.C.) less than five percent ever  graduate from high school and  even then most have a grade 4 or 5  reading level. With this education  level it is not surprising that more  than 50 percent of the Deaf community is dependent on unemployment or welfare to survive.  Where hearing educators use  these statistics to back up their  integration pohcies, Deaf educators beheve illiteracy among Deaf  people is the result of the lack  of support for Deaf instructors in  schools. Of the 863 teachers for the  deaf in Canada, less than 55 (6  percent) are deaf. Another problem is that Canadian universities  do not offer ASL in their teaching  courses.  "I want to be able to study  ASL at school," continued Ram, "I  want to learn to dance, learn about  art, learn about childcare. I want  a principal who is deaf so that I  have someone to look up to. I will  never be hearing."  4 KINESIS Support your dyke centre  by Terry Gibson  Within two months the Vancouver Lesbian Centre (VLC) may  be forced to shut down. Opened in  1984, the VLC collective has maintained the centre through their  own fundraising efforts, having  been denied government funding  on four separate occasions.  But recently, support for VLC  fundraisers has dropped off sharply  and the centre is in serious financial trouble.  The VLC workers point to a  number or reasons for the recent  setbacks in fundraising. For example, a few weeks ago, there were  three feminist fundraising events  on the same weekend in Vancouver; women had to choose and  the profits were split. Women also  have a tendency to 'cocoon' more,  that is, stay at home instead of  going out. As well, without the  money to advertise on a grand  scale, people don't always know  about dances or coffeehouses.  "It takes $1200 a month to pay  rent, hydro and basic costs at the  centre," said Sage de Belle, a core  collective member. "This month  we have no money in the bank and  have had to borrow to stay open."  "A lot of doors are closing  (for women)," said Maureen Mills,  another core member. "How do  women's groups survive without  funding?"  Some of the services that would  be jeopardized if the VLC closed  include a help hne, library, meeting space for other groups, housing/jobs/business postings, speakers bureaus, drop-in space, coming-out groups, lay counselling and  basic referrals.  Worth special mention are the  coming-out groups which run  three   times  a  year,   accommo  dating 15 women each session,  and are the only ones exclusive  to women throughout the Lower  Mainland. Co-facilitated by two  staff members, time is spent on issues such as: sexuahty, racism, sexism, sizeism and classism. The focus is on self-challenging, creating  awareness and personal growth.  The approach is positive so women  emerge confident and proud of  their lesbianism, despite an anti-  gay world.  VLC has seven core members  and six volunteer staff. According to de Belle, woman-power is  not the issue. In fact, she stressed  that, should the VLC lose their  office, the collective will continue,  working out of each other's homes.  The pohtical work will go on—  currently a major project is a  year-old battle over same-sex benefits in the workplace. Also, Sage's  Restaurant will remain on the  Pictured here is the VLC's first birthday party celebration—the centre  is appealing for donations from the community to keep this vital service  open.  Northern conference forges links  by Karen Ballinger  I arrived at the Northern  Women's Conference, held at  Prince George in late April, after a six hour drive to find there  was an additional charge for bringing my daughter. I felt this should  have been made clear before as  not everyone can afford additional  charges. Certainly, I had not budgeted for this. One of the organizers said I could pay after returning  home. This is another example of  how mothers and children are discriminated against in our society.  This probably explains the lack of  many children at the conference.  They did provide a 10 cent per  kilometre subsidy after deducting  the initial $50 and free childcare  during Saturday. This is an issue,  though, that should be addressed  before the next conference.  The conference was called "Wilderness Survival," a B.C. Northern Women's Conference. It was  good to see that a large number of the women were Native  as too many times Native women  are absent from women's conferences. I found out later that the  Friendship Centres were on the  conference mailing hst along with  the women's centres. The furthest distance travelled by women  was from Hay River, N.W.T. and  from Whitehorse. Most of the delegates were from Terrace and areas  around there which is where the  organizers hve. Prince George does  not have a women's centre and  only two local women attended.  The wine and cheese on Friday night from 8 to 10pm was  enjoyable and a good opportunity for women to meet. Sue  Hollick-Kenyon was there to explain the cuts in the federal government funding. The name 'wine  and cheese' may have stopped  some women from attending because of addiction problems. There  was also coffee and water available for those who chose not to  drink. Fruit juice would have been  nice, but a limited budget causes  choices to be made.  The foUowing morning my  daughter was taken to the child  caretaker where she spent an enjoyable day. This was provided free  of charge. Breakfast consisted of  muffins and fruit—which ran out.  Some women had to buy their  breakfast in the restaurant. The  hotel staff did not keep a close  check on food and we ran out at  lunch also. Perhaps they thought  women would not eat very much.  The high energy level at women's  conferences always seems to make  everyone hungry.  My first workshop was on Politicizing Women and was presented  by Sandra Kovacs, mayor of Fort  the particular problems of addictions and co-dependency in the  North. She said, "Everyone's hves  have been touched by alcohol in  some way." Women are especially  susceptible to the co-dependency  trap due to our nurturing roles.  We spent time identifying addictive behaviours and the underlying reasons for them: basically low  self-esteem and avoidance of feelings. We talked a lot about how  to handle addictive behaviours in  ways that were helpful to the  addict and helpful to avoid co-  dependency traps.  After this busy day, Saturday night held the banquet and  keynote speaker, Shamsher Pan-  num, a young woman speaking  from the perspective of youth  starting to take their places in the  workplace, university and in the  home. Shamsher gave us insights  into the new wave of feminism that  has grown up with women role  VLC agenda, as a long-term solution to their fundraising problems.  "We are the only organized  voice for lesbians in Vancouver,"  said de Belle. "The community  needs us."  In a needs survey conducted  recently, 40 out of 50 questionnaires were returned saying the  same thing: VLC's survival is vital.  "It is just as important for  straight feminists to support us,"  models. Young women expect to  have a career and to decide when  and if to get married and when and  if to have children. They expect to  be equal.  On Sunday morning the last  workshop was presented by Shirley  Adams of Aiyansh, a Nisga'a  leader. She talked on the Traditional Roles of Native women,  how women were devalued after  contact with the white patriarchal system. One of the things she  said was that a rapist in their  culture was beheaded. She spoke  about the four classes and how  their matriarchal society functioned. Women were given respect.  A man who married a woman hved  at her house for five years and if  he did not show the woman proper  respect he would be publicly divorced. His chances of being remarried were almost nil.  adds Mills. "Lesbianism ties into  control of our bodies, access to  abortion, rape crisis centres, transition houses and women's centres.  The door must stay opened."  The VLC is launching a campaign to urge individual women to  support the centre by making a donation. The centre is holding an  Open House on June 28th to further acquaint the community with  their services and needs.  She talked about the role of the  matriarchs in keeping the records.  These women were the memory  banks. Everything that went on in  the community was remembered  and a pubhc accounting would  take place. These women held  great importance and were consulted during marriage arrangements and during pubhc feasts. In  present times she spoke of the importance of knowing how the system works and using this knowledge for the benefit of your organization or for your own personal  use.

Clinic elects new board  St. James. She gave an excellent  presentation. Her friendly manner relaxed the participants and  there were lots of questions about  municipal pohtics. She asked us  about our experiences in our towns  and encouraged all women to consider running for municipal government. She told of possible pitfalls, the long hours and humourous incidents that had happened to her both as alderman and  as mayor. We all came away with  positive possibilities.  The second workshop I attended was on Women and Addictions. Pat Wilson, Drug and Alcohol Counsellor from Buick Creek  (for Southerners, Buick Creek is  near   Fort  St.   John)   spoke  on  by Esther Shannon  Over 100 members of the Everywoman's Health Centre Society  (EWHC) turned out in early May  to elect the Society's Management  Board which will now take over the  management of Vancouver's only  free-standing abortion clinic.  The EWHC was established last  November by the B.C. Coalition  for Abortion Chnics (BCCAC)  and the May meeting, a follow-up  to an initial meeting in January,  heard reports of the clinic's activities and finances. The establishment of a separate society to manage the clinic will allow the BCCAC to focus more energy on its  goals of establishing free-standing  abortion clinics throughout B. C.  and pressuring the provincial government to include abortion chnic  services under the province's Medical Services Plan. The BCCAC is  also active in the campaign to prevent the passage of a new abortion  law in Canada.  The foUowing women were  elected to the Management Board  by the clinic membership: Jackie  Brown, Margaret BirreU, Hilda  Thomas, Jessica Gossen, Kyong  Ae, Ruth Houle, Anne HamU-  ton and Penny TUbey. Kyong Ae  has since resigned her position.  These women wUl be joined on the  board by the chnic's new Medical Director, Dr. Lucy Lemieux  and by three representatives appointed from the BCCAC Steering Committee, Jackie Ainsworth,  Dr. Robert Makaroff and Betty  Sheffer. A resolution seeking to  limit BCCAC Steering Committee  membership on the EWHC board  was defeated by the membership,  which wanted to ensure that BCCAC — described as a key group  in the pohtical fight for abortion  — had strong representation on  the clinic's decision-making body.  At the meeting, a spokesperson announced that the clinic has  been awarded the 1988 B.C. Pubhc Health Association award of  merit. The association, which has  a membership of several hundred  pubhc health organizations, made  the award in recognition of the  chnic's activities, vision and initiative.

KINESIS  June 89 Across Canada  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx^  ^SSxxxxxxxSS^^  WHAT* S NEWS?  by Donna Butorac  Nannies  A self-employed Toronto lawyer has won  the right to deduct her nanny's salary as a  business tax deduction, foUowing a Federal  Court of Canada ruhng based on equahty  rights. The federal government has said it  wiU appeal the ruhng to the Supreme Court  of Canada.  Although the decision has been applauded by some women, Penny Coates,  vice-president of the Canada Daycare Advocacy Association (CD A A) sees it as a sideways step in the struggle for better daycare  services. "I can't say it's backwards because  I don't think we can go much further backwards on daycare issues in Canada."  In spite of last year's rather grandiose  election promise to spend $4 billion over  seven years to create 200,000 daycare  spaces, the Tory government's recent federal budget has made a complete mockery  of its commitment to improve daycare faculties in Canada.  CDAA opposes assisting with cluld care  costs through tax deductions because it  benefits high income earners and discriminates against poor people. They argue instead for direct payment into daycare programs to improve the quahty and quantity  of daycare avaUable. Such payments would  be used to increase the number of daycare spaces for aU types of facilities, to increase salaries, decrease fees, and improve  the quahty of daycare.  Formula  deadly  A dangerously high level of aluminum  in infant formulas is blamed for the 1985  deaths of two babies in the U.S. Research  into heavy metal contamination of infant  formulas Mowed the discovery that the  cause of death in both cases was aluminum  intoxication. Both infants were formula-fed.  Current research by Health and Welfare  Canada estimates that aluminum ingestion  by infants fed cow or human milk exclusively is 2-3 micrograms per day. Infants  fed soy-based formulas ingest 1,260 micro-  grams/day. The consumption of the formula brans Isonul has the highest mean aluminum levels, at an average of 2,088 micro-  grams/day. Infants on milk-based formulas  consume an average of 82 micrograms/day.  The most susceptible to aluminum intoxicar  tion are babies born prematurely, low birth  weight infants and those with kidney dysfunctions. The immature kidneys of these  infants are less capable of ridding the body  of excess aluminum than full term healthy  babies.  In response to the two 1985 deaths, the  American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended the avoidance of soy-based formulas  for low birth weight or renally impaired infants. Aluminum contamination is the result  of the manufacturing process, and Dr. Winston Koo of the University of Alberta recommends that low aluminum ingredients,  additives and storage containers be used for  formulas.

The SAPLRC includes representatives of  a dozen Saskatchewan communities, as weU  as Native people, women, the disabled and  senior citizens.

It's an important  first step in the long struggle to end poverty.  Ralph claims that poor people organize  because they have no choice.

Source: Briarpatch  Daycare  workers  Continued dissatisfaction with the government's handling of daycare services in  Quebec led about 2,000 workers in nonprofit daycare centres to stage a one-day  walkout earlier this month. The employees,  who care for about 15,000 chUdren, claim  that the government's 1988 budget commitment to improve famUy services was httle  more than a promise. There are one mU-  hon chUdren under the age of twelve in the  province, and almost 300,000 of these are eligible for daycare. But there are fewer than  70,000 places avaUable in Quebec's 500 centres.  Last year's stated aim of creating 60,000  new spaces in 5 years has been sidestepped  by the Quebec government, and the minister responsible, Monique Gagnon-Tremblay,  blames last month's federal budget.  However, the 2,000 striking employees,  who work in the province's 137 non-profit  daycare centres claim that the province  "comes up with too httle money too late."  Claudette Pitre-Robin, spokeswoman for  the association of non-profit daycare cen  tres says the present government scheme  favours smaUer centres which charge higher  fees, at the expense of the larger ones with  lower fees. Parents who act as volunteer administrators on the boards of the non-profit  centres have threatened to resign if more  money is not forthcoming. Source: Globe  and Mail  Birth rate  Recent attempts by the Quebec government to reverse a worrisome decline in  the birth rate have been met with s  skepticism by the Quebec Federation of  Women (QFW). QFW President Constance  Middleton-Hope says the announced system  of increased baby bonuses wUl only seem  hke a good financial incentive to families  who have been on welfare a long tim, or who  are at the bottom end of the financial scaled.  This year the government raised the  bonus for a third or subsequent chUd to  $4,500 from $3,000. It also doubled the premium for a second chUd to $1,000. A first  chUd wUl stiU bring in $500.  Middleton-Hope claims that few women  'wUl be lured by these sums of money, "particularly if they're having to work outside  of the home and are partly supporting their  family, or if they are single parents." QFW  would much rather see the Quebec government spend the money on increasing the  number of daycare spaces, as a way of promoting more births. The recent Quebec  budget foresees 6,208 new spaces which is  2,463 fewer than promised in a provincial  government daycare pohcy paper issued late  last year. Source: Canadian Press  Prostitutes  A B.C. prostitute recently lost her appeal against a conviction of communicating with a pohce officer for the purpose  of prostitution in September 1988. Origi-  naUy acquitted of the charge in provincial  court, Pamela Smith was later convicted in  county court under BUl C-49 which prohibits communication in a "public place ...  and any motor vehicle located in a pubhc  place" for the purpose of prostitution. In  the appeal, defense counsel Tony Serka argued that the wording suggested that a motor vehicle must be stationary to be located  in a pubhc place, since " 'located' means  and implies a fixed situation." The appeal  was unanimously rejected.  In related news, the section of the Criminal Code dealing with pimping was overturned in a recent Ontario court case involving a man who hves with a prostitute.  Previously, anyone hving with a prostitute  was considered to be a pimp. In this particular case however, the judge ruled that the  man in question was not a pimp because  there was ample evidence that he was self-  supporting.  Valerie Scott, of the Canadian Organization for the Rights of Prostitutes (CORP)  says her organization is pleased with the decision, and that "we would hke to see the  entire pimping law thrown out. Prostitutes  should not be prevented from supporting  the people they hve with." The pimping  laws are generally used not to protect prostitutes, as many people argue, but to harass them, Scott said. Sources: Canadian  Press and Rites  KINESIS Across Canada  The following statement by Rose Gregorie and Elizabeth Penashue, two Innu  women from the Sheshatshit Women's  Group in Nitassinan (Northern Quebec-  Labrador), was delivered to the annual  general meeting of the National Action Council on the Status of Women  (NAC) held in Ottawa in mid-May.  Gregorie and Penashue are just two  of the many Innu from the region  who are fighting the construction of  a proposed North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Tactical Fighter  Weapons Training Centre at Goose  Bay, Labrador.  The Canadian and American military have occupied the region since  1941. Since 1979, NATO military aircraft have been conducting intensive  low-level training flights out of the  Canadian Forces Base (CFB) in Goose  Bay. Currently there are upwards of  6,000 high-speed, low-level flights a  year, many of them directly over Innu  camps.  The testing range covers roughly one  hundred thousand kilometers of land,  directly over the traditional Innu territory, which covers a total of 259,000  kilometers. Nearly 10,000 Innu, who  still pursue their traditional way of  life, live in the forests and tundra of  this area. Present training flights, which  take place at an altitude of 100 feet,  have already had a serious impact on  people, wildlife and the environment,  particularly because of the loud and  unexpected noise produced by the jets.  There is documented evidence that, as  part of the training simulations, fighter  jets drop 500 kilo cement blocks during  their practice bombing runs.  The Innu people have never ceded,  through any treaty or land agreement,  their coUective right to self determination and permanent jurisdiction  over their territory and its natural resources. For the past 30 years they  have protested the ever increasing state  and military intrusion on their land.  The most recent wave of protests began on Sept. 11 when several Innu set  up a protest camp on one of the testing  ranges, about 100 miles south of Goose  Bay.  Since then, the crown has laid 233  charges against Innu protesters, who  continue to re-occupy and blockade  the testing ranges and the base at  Goose Bay. On April 18, the first four  protesters who were tried—including  Elizabeth Pensahue—won a landmark  acquittal by an Innu judge who accepted  their arguments that ihey held an honest belief that the land on which the air  base is located belongs to the Innu and  therefore they committed no wrong. The  day after the acquittal, 75 Innu were  cleared from a base runway after they  tried to deliver letters to Canada and its  NATO allies telling them they are trespassing on Innu land. Eleven protestors  were arrested.  Along with the opposition from the  Canadian government and military and  its NATO allies, the Innu also face opposition from the Goose Bay townspeople who believe the NATO base will  bring significant economic benefits to  the region.

Innu people stand fast  by Rose Gregorie and  Elizabeth Penashue  When we were young girls, the Innu VUlages of Sheshatshit, Utshimassit, Pukut-  shipit, Unemeinshipit and Nutashkuan did  not exist. We hved aU year in our tents trav-  eUing across our own country, Nitassinan.  Our mothers and fathers fed us with the animals they kUled.  The true hfe of the Innu People as nomads and hunters is not an easy one. Sometimes we were hungry. But we never felt  hopelessness or that we had lost control of  our hves or that we did not know who we  were. And we always knew, as we know now,  have seen control of our country, the land  that gave us birth as a People thousands of  years ago, taken from us. And now we are  treated as if we were invisible, as if we do  not exist. We are a hunting People. To keep  us in one place, in a vUlage, has meant that  they have tried to separate us from everything that gives our hfe as a People meaning. It has also meant that we have been  changed in only a few years from one of the  most self-reliant and independent Peoples in  the world to one of the most dependent.  We think they thought, the Europeans,  that because they gave us money to keep us  alive, that we would stay sUent forever and  die off quietly as a distinct People, whUe  Demonstrators at Goose Bay protest against jet flights over hunting grounds.  that Nitassinan, our country, was our home  and belonged to us the Innu People of the  Labrador-Quebec peninsula.  And although the Innu hfe is sometimes  hard, we were rich in our culture and no  foreigner bossed our mothers and fathers  around on their own land. No one tried to  teU us that Nitassinan was not our country.  No one tried to stop us hunting or put us in  prison for killing caribou or peacefully walking on our own land. We were a free People.  Although we had no pohce, we never  needed any. We did not know what crime  was. AU the Innu had a purpose in their  hves and responsibility in their hves. None  of our people ever tried to kiU themselves,  there was no violence in Innu families, our  chUdren were aU properly cared for, brought  up and educated as Innu, and they knew  and were proud of who and what they were.  In the 1950's, Europeans began to move  into Nitassinan in large numbers. They buUt  a railroad from Uashat or Sept Ues to Pet-  shesekupau and buUt a mining town there  which they called ScheffervUle. At the same  time a foreign government moved into Nitassinan. They tried to stop the Innu from  moving and began to buUd the first houses  to keep us in one place. The last two  groups of Innu were moved into houses in  1968 and 1972 when the vUlages of Davis  Inlet/Utshimassits and Saint Augustine/  Pukutshipit were buUt.  In a few short years we have been completely robbed of our land and freedom. We  they helped themselves to our land and our  water.  The settlers often point out that what are  supposed to be the organizations that are  defending Innu rights receive, and have in  the past received, large amounts of money  from the European government. This is true  but we know that these organizations were  introduced among us in the 1970's to try  and control us by making it impossible for  us to fight back except in ways and places  where the rules of the game were set by the  European. And if we did something they  didn't hke, they threatened to cut off money  and sometimes did. So even here, in our  ways of expressing our anger and sadness  and resistance, we were dependent.  These organizations, including the Band  CouncUs, were imposed on us. They are not  Innu things and do not work in the way our  society works. Even some of the people who  the Europeans caU Chiefs know this and understand this very weU and although they  are in these positions and trying to deal  with the problems in the vUlages, they support very strongly what we are doing.  One of the non-Innu things about the system which has been forced on us is the way  in which the role of all adult Innu to have  a say has been changed. In Innu society,  aU Innu people, men and women, are involved in deciding things, but in these foreign things which have been placed on our  hves, it seems to become only the men.  So in our new resistance against what is  being done to our People it has almost been  easier for us Innu women to fight back because we were never reaUy part of that system which has been imposed on us, and  which was paid for and controUed by our  foreign rulers.  Our fight for our People is not a fight just  for women but for aU our People. It is not a  women's issue but an Innu issue and we have  welcomed any Innu person who wUl fight  alongside us to create a free and healthy  world for our chUdren and grandchUdren.  We have watched our People begin to fall  apart. We have seen our chUdren robbed of  everything that makes us Innu in a school  system which makes them look down on  their own People and culture.  Our People have been deeply wounded by  what has happened in the past 25 years. The  government that invaded our country then,  now thinks that we are weak enough to bury  alive. The one thing that has stopped our  complete breakdown as a People has been  the months we stiU hve away from the vUlages in our tents in the country.  For the families who now have houses in  Sheshatshit, we find ourselves right alongside what Canada wants to make into a  NATO base. Even with no base each year  the military grow bigger there and the number of low level flights grows bigger. There  is now one bombing range and many, many  targets where they do not yet drop anything  but use for practice attacks. Most of these  are on or near lakes where the Innu go in  the spring and FaU. We feel that we have  been shoved to the edge of a cliff in the last  25 years. Now they want to push us over.  Nitassinan is our land. We never gave it  "...They thought...  because they gave  us money...that we  would stay silent  forever..."  to them. How do they feel they can come in  and take it and treat us as if we were not human beings, as if we were invisible to them?  And there is only one Nitassinan and  one Innu People. Canada tries to say that  there is Quebec and Labrador, that there  are the Montagnais of Quebec and the Innu  of Labrador. And they use the organizations  they have made and paid for to break up our  People and our land to fit into their pohtical system not ours. And then Canada says  there are two different Native groups fighting over the same land. This is a he.  We spent part of our chUdhood with our  parents travelling back and forth over what  the Europeans now say is a border between  Quebec and Newfoundland. Our fathers and  mothers and our brothers and sisters are  hsted by Canada as members of the Sept  Ues Band. What are we supposed to be in  their eyes?  We know what we are and what our  people are. We are Innu. AU of the People that the Europeans call Montagnais or  Naskapi are the Innu People and we have  one land that stretches from the Gulf of  Saint Lawrence to the Atlantic Coast, Nitassinan.  One last thing, we are fighting for our  land and for our rights and identity as a distinct hunting people in our own land, Nitassinan. We are not going to jaU, becoming separated from our chUdren just to get  rich land claims. Our fight is not about land  claims, which is only another thing being  used against us to get us to surrender what  we wiU never, ever give up, that is our ownership of Nitassinan and our Innu identity.  KINESIS Across Canada  Immigrant and refugee health  by Terrie Hamazaki  A recent Task Force Report on Mental Health Issues affecting Immigrants and  Refugees is long overdue, say interested  multicultural community organizations.  InitiaUy sparked by discussions at a meeting of the Visible Minority Women Caucus in 1986, the twelve-member Task Force,  chaired by Dr. Morton Beiser, a UBC psychiatrist, was commissioned by the Ministry  of Multiculturalism and Health and Welfare  Canada to examine the mental health needs  of immigrants and refugees. The members  carried out its two-year mandate by reviewing the relevant academic literature and by  inviting oral and written submissions from  service agencies, ethnic organizations, and  immigrant and refugee self-help groups.  The final report entitled, "After the Door  Has Been Opened," details 27 recommendations classified within three areas: namely,  preventative health, 'mainstreaming' cross-  cultural care, and ongoing commitments.  Within these three areas, the recommendations identify such needs as: specific support  services and materials, cross-cultural awareness and training, employment assistance,  language training, research and mechanisms  for ongoing co-ordination.  The report highlights the growing recog-  the treatment of immigrants, refugees and  ethnic minorities in general, adding that  he would initiate a feasibility study, said  Beiser.  Government Support Inadequate  There is a consensus within the mental  health professional community that about  $20 million is needed just to restore services. Immigration is federal responsibU-  ity, but as increasingly more costs are  transferred into provincial hands (shades of  Meech Lake), B.C.'s current expenditure of  $8.76 per immigrant, compared to Manitoba's $226.73, may remain static.  "Of the top five immigrant-receiving  provinces, British Columbia looks bad, and  our report had implied criticism of our government," said Beiser.  Currently, landed immigrants and refugee  applicants who've received work permits  qualify for provincial medical insurance after a maximum three-month waiting period.  "But then the cost is very high, and  they can't afford it," said Miriam Maurer  of the Multilingual Orientation Services Association for Immigrant Communities (MOSAIC). She then described the tedious process that those without medical coverage  must go through to obtain any kind of  health care. In short, the patient stumbles  nition of the stresses that are imposed by  immigration, especiaUy for victims of torture, a problem whose dimensions none of  us would have guessed once upon a time,  said Beiser.  Federal Health and Welfare Minister Perrin Beatty has since promised to foUow up  on report recommendations, saying that he  would ask the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture to propose specific research  on how torture affects the mental health of  refugees. He has also promised to set up  a special working group on multicultural  health to advise federal and provincial ministries of health on issues raised in the report.  Beatty did express concern about the  cost of setting up special centres to train  social and health service professionals in  bhndfolded through a bureaucratic maze in  which they must secure letters of authorization from various governmental departments before receiving medical attention.  Further barriers abound once authorization or benefits are granted. Lack of ongoing  funding to the various multicultural health  organizations has resulted in a tremendous  decrease in staff power capable of meeting  immigrant and refugee needs. As Dr. K.C.  Li, Strathcona Team psychiatrist succinctly  understated, "... our chents are poorly  served." This reality was echoed at other  multicultural community groups.  The Beiser report had recommended that  as a preventative measure, there should be a  guarantee of ongoing core funding to immigrant service agencies to ensure their operation on a long-term basis. Further, it recom  mended that as a remedial measure, cross-  cultural education for mental-health care  professionals be made a priority.  But whUe bilingual and bicultural training  would improve accessibihty for the immigrant and refugee populations, Sashi As-  sanand of the Orientation Adjustment Services for Immigrants (OASIS) cautioned  against our operating under a white anglo-  saxon protestant mentality with its assumption of 'unspoken conformity.' Too often,  health professionals think immigrants and  refugees are all the same, and treat their  mental health needs using a North American model.  health-care professionals, she said.  This was but one of thousands of submissions received by the Task Force during national hearings in which groups ranging from small, isolated ethnic associations  to large umbreUa organizations were heard.  Most had emphasized the need for language  training for immigrants and refugees, and  the need for education of ethno-sensitive  mental health care practitioners.  But some later said that although the  same recommendations are made each and  every year, the Mow-up rate is low. Referring to a mountainous pUe of reports he's  "There are estimated thousands of torture  survivors in the Lower Mainland whose  extreme loss of self-control has resulted  in psychological scars that may never  disappear"  She added that because immigrants  struggle against both the stigma of mental Ulness, and a culturaUy-reflective, self-  imposed isolation, they wUl not try to access mental health care, preferring to look  inward to an extended family network, or  outward to their church for help.  "We have to go two steps further to help  them. First, we create that need if we see  problems, then we service that need," she  said.  "Mental health depends on a sense of  empowerment because having a measure of  control over what happens to us is important to our mental weU-being."  There are estimated thousands of torture  survivors in the Lower Mainland, whose extreme loss of self-control has resulted in  psychological scars that may never disappear. "More than an open door and a welfare cheque is needed for these people,"  said Yaya de Andrade, a psychologist who  volunteers with the Vancouver Association  of Survivors of Torture (VAST), a self-  sustaining network of about 70 members  who meet monthly to educate themselves  and others on treatment programs for survivors of torture.  She hopes that projects wUl be funded as  a direct result of Beiser's report, but realistically expects that instead, costly 'needs  assessment' programs wUl receive funds.  Special Needs  Critics of the report say it demonstrates  a lack of adequate awareness of the differences in mental health issues affecting immigrants and refugees, and suggest that it  should have been written in two sections:  Immigrants and Refugees. Moreover, that  by treating these categories as if they were  mutuaUy exclusive, it is unclear whether a  teen-age woman refugee would face 'triple  jeopardy.'  In reality however, young, single refugee  mothers who are isolated at home by language and cultural barriers have the most  problems, said Leshe Anderson of Vancouver's YWCA. Because their needs are often overlooked, they faU through the cracks  of accessibihty; language training programs  tend to ignore them, she said.  Also, because everything in a famUy's  hfe often moves around the woman in the  family, we may make it difficult for them,  especiaUy if they are being battered, by  telling them to "get out," completely ignoring the strength of their traditions, said  Marion Pohakoff of the B.C. Association of  Social Workers. CulturaUy appropriate consciousness raising/training workshops and  programs should be mandatory for mental  written to the government since 1974, Dr.  Li said that, "even if 50 percent of aU recommendations are implemented, I would be  ecstatic."  According to the report, some efforts  to provide pre-migration orientation are  underway. A Pohsh-language videotape  and brochure have been produced by  the Canada Employment and Immigration  Commission (CEIC) in collaboration with  Polish immigrants and distributed abroad.  A similar program for Central and South  Americans is in the early stages of development.  As weU, projects such as support groups  for Indo-Canadian women and their chUdren have been formed by the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA);  their Vancouver branch has just produced  brochures in Spanish, Chinese and Punjabi  on mental health issues; the B.C. Association of Social Workers routinely holds workshops for their members on increasing understanding of their ethnic chents, and the  hst goes on.  The importance of the report is beyond question. In a comprehensive manner, it promotes mental health care issues  using preventative measures and demonstrates the ongoing need for services that  are culturaUy and linguistically accessible.  Change is inevitable and we should not  tolerate, but feel enriched by multiculturalism, said Beiser. We've opened our doors  and our minds, now it is time to open our  hearts.

And now the new joo-aiee-cee!" A  large teardrop roUed out of the corner of  her eye and she angrily wiped it off with the  back of her hand. I could not help noticing  the caUouses on her palm, at the base of the  two middle fingers.  "How did your hands get such nasty callouses?" I asked, pulling her palm forward.  The angry furrow on her brow disappeared  for a moment, and she smUed wistfuUy: "My  daughter, these hands have known nothing  but work—no rest, no creams or lotions, no  caresses, just work and more work.  In India, ever since I came as a young  bride to my husband's vUlage at the age of  sixteen, I helped with work on the fields beside my husband. In fact, my fourth chUd  was born in a httle hut by the weU on our  land. I remember my husband standing by  foolishly at the door, in a stupor as I lay  writhing with labour pain. But that was  the way it was ... agricultural work, year  round, all my hfe, and now I am three times  twenty plus two years old. The only year I  did not bury my hands in the soil or dabble in the bushes was the year we came to  Canada. And that was almost 15 years ago.  We came here in the winter; the weather  was angry, the winds were hostUe and the  earth lay curled up in a sulk. I was amazed  for I had never seen the land withdraw thus,  before. Then my son told me, 'Mother this  is Canada. You wUl find many things withdrawn and cold over here.'  When the summer came, my old man and  I joined my daughters-in-law and their old  parents to work on the farms here, around  Vancouver. And since then, each year I wait  for the summer to come so that I can go  out and work on the farms. It is the only  work I know, it's the only work I have ever  done. But now I don't know ..." Her voice  traUed off as the tears began once again to  gather in her eyes.  "My daughter, Hardial Kaur's story is  the story of aU of us old women here," said  the fraU old Kuldip Kaur. Yes, indeed it  was true. I had gone to visit Hardial Kaur  and found her in the company of five other  women, her friends from the neighbourhood. And today they were not exchanging  harmless tidbits of news or gossip. Today  something very serious and truly 'harmful'  was afoot—the new U.L proposal, or as referred to by the women, the new joo-aiee-cee  Anti-pesticide video  by Donna Morgan  Imagine there are thousands of toxic  chemicals in your workplace. Your boss does  not provide you with protective equipment.  You are not informed about these chemicals, nor do you have a right to get the information. You are excluded from Occupational Health and Safety regulations. You  know that people exposed to the chemicals  have high rates of cancers, birth defects and  premature death.  This is the situation British Columbia's  farmworkers face. The fields they work in  are continually sprayed with toxic pesticides, yet there are no regulations forcing  the farm owners to inform workers about  the spraying.  In order to educate farmworkers about  the hazards of pesticides, the Canadian  Farmworkers' Union and the DEOL Society  have produced a video, 'Caught In A World  Of Pesticides.'  Depicting discussions with farmworkers,  dramatized segments, and emphatic graphics, the video warns farmworkers of the ways  pesticides affect their health and tells them  how to best protect themselves. The video  focuses on women farmworkers, who in addition to field work are often responsible  for preparing meals and washing pesticide-  soaked clothing.  The video, written by Devinder Grewal,  Nora Randall and Mae Burrows, covers  more than a text-book look at pesticide effects. Besides warnings about pesticide poisoning, protection against pesticides, and  the importance of keeping pesticides away  from food, the video also shows farmworkers organizing to solve the problems posed  by the combination of toxins at work and a  lack of protective regulations.  In the video, farmworkers meet to discuss  health issues and how to deal with them.  The video also touches on the broader issue  of pesticide effects on consumers.  The video is weU-produced, and wUl be a  good educational tool. Except for one dramatized section, which depicts a discussion  between a farmworker and an uncommonly  weU-informed and sympathetic doctor, the  tape is very realistic in its presentation. Because of the discussion of farmwork conditions and pesticide effects, the video is of  interest to a range of people—farmworkers,  environmentalists, and other labourers.  The 23-minute film was produced by  Helena Cynamon and Mae Burrows,  and is available in English and Punjabi as a package with educational materials from the DEOL Society, 1-4725  Kingsway, Vancouver, B.C.

They thought they had scanty information on the new proposal and therefore,  were aU the more fearful of the untold horrors the entire proposal might incorporate.  I, on my part, was impressed by how much  they knew about the proposed changes to  the U.L regulation.  During that solemn discussion, they applied the various proposed and possible U.L  changes to their situation and the dismal  picture that emerged made them very sad  and me very angry. "Perhaps this wUl force  us now to go on welfare," said Sultan Kaur.  "How can anyone survive on such httle  money? The government does not want us  to hve in dignity, by the fruits of our labour.  It wants to reduce us to beggars, to have us  spread our hands to them for alms."  This sense of alarm and apprehension is  echoed throughout the hundred thousand  strong South Asian community in B.C., a  majority of whom are Punjabi immigrants  from India. Hailing overwhelmingly from a  peasant background and, according to the  Canadian department of immigration, lacking in technical or 'marketable' skUls, the  South Asian community has, for some years,  acted as the labour pool for B.C.'s lumber,  forestry and agricultural industry. While  the first two sectors absorb the males of this  community, the women are almost singularly siphoned off as labour to B.C.'s farm  industry. Currently, according to the president of the Canadian Farmworkers Union  there are approximately 28,000 farmworkers in B.C. Of these, 78 to 82 percent are  women, and another five to eight percent  are seniors.  Apart from the farm industry which engages such vast numbers of South Asian  women and elders on a seasonal basis, other  kinds of industrial activities which attract  workers from this community are food processing, fish canneries, the garment and  knitting industry and janitorial work. AU  these activities are characterized by cyclical and temporary work which is more often than not, seasonal.  The working conditions typifying this  work are abysmally poor, benefits are absent, health and safety regulations inoperative, and unions when they do exist are  somehow rendered inactive. In many instances, the minimum wage does not apply and neither do any stipulates of the  Worker's Compensation Board. In the farm  industry for instance, workers toU 12 to 15  hours a day at $2.80 an hour. Overtime  wages are unheard of in aU these sectors of  the Canadian economy. Sexual harassment  is rampant, exploitation is extreme and intimidation to the point of sUencing is complete.  And who are the hapless workers that  are condemned to such abject misery?  What compulsion, what disabUity, what irrationality of behaviour must these humans  be suffering from so as to 'voluntarily' enslave themselves to such unwholesome and  dismal environs for work? These workers  are women. In most of the jobs enumerated  above, the workers are South Asian women.  And what enslaves them and keeps them  'unfree' as labour is the fact that these are  immigrant and visible minority women.  DweU for a moment on this term that is  deeply loaded. It explicates not just a physical attribute but holds within it the kernel  of their enslavement and specific exploitation within the differentiated labour sector.  This term, for instance, immediately tells  us that a worker belonging to this category speaks httle or no Enghsh, works at  the lowest rungs of the job sector, works infinitely long hours of the day. Others work-i  ing alongside her are aU of her kind; seemingly they look hke sisters and do speak the:  same language, yet they hardly talk to each'  other whUe at work—they are not aUowed  to. This term also tells us that these are the:  women who wUl be pawed at by their white  or brown bosses, poked fun at, made the!  target of racist obscenities.

A ground breaking study which shows  that "judges often reach biased decision  which favor men." has been released by the  Manitoba Association of Women and the  Law (MAWL). The report, the first of its  kind in Canada, argues that judges "need  to be educated regarding their perceptions  of women and their appropriate role" and  calls for the establishment of a national task  force on gender equahty in Canadian courts.  Manitoba lawyer, Mona Brown, author of  the study, "Gender Equahty in the Courts,"  noted that "GeneraUy, the courts appear  to assume that women and men have, in  fact, achieved social and economic equality. The reality is that Canadian women  continue to be disadvantaged in the workplace, in the home and elsewhere, resulting in women usuaUy being in a position of  economic and emotional dpendancy, having  fewer resources, lower status and less flexibility."  The study was compUed from a review  of recent cases, mostly in Manitoba, involving personal injury damages and a range of  family law issues such as spousal support,  chUd custody, access and support and post  divorce division of property. Because the  study was prepared with minimal resources,  it could not deal with areas such as crimmi-  nal law and family violence. It has also not  addressed what it deems "the far greater  barrier in the courts" faced by women of  colour, aboriginal women, disabled women,  lesbians or prostitutes, and pledges to work  to assure future research in these areas.  With regard to spousal support, the  study argues that whUe separating couples  are encouraged to resolve thier disagreement with recourse to the courts, "a woman  is more often in a more disadvantaged position in comparison to her husband, both  economicaUy, emotionaUy and physicaUy,"  with the result that "women sign separation agreements even though the agreement  may be extremely unfair and one-sided."  sided."  The report refers to the case of an older  woman who had been out of the workforce  for 24 years and had no marketable skUls,  althrough she had begun part-time work in  a low paying job. The judge awarded her  $250 a month in support payments from her  former husband, who earned more than 10  times that amount each month. This kind  of unfairness is not the exception and is the  result of judges who emphasizing Divorce  Act requirements that call for each spouse's  economic self- sufficiency without looking at  another of the Act's requirements that they  consider how that could be achieved, according to the report.  U.I. from page 9  The immigrant and visible minority  women have proven to be the most successful model of an ideal worker in the western  industrialized world. They constitute the  most industrious and dUigent of aU workforces, as weU as the most disciplined. WhUe  aU women workers can be said to hold these  attributes, the immigrant and visible minority women become even more attractive as  workers and therefore coveted by employers  account of their lack of knowledge and  fear of the Canadian system. And since they  are always referred to as immigrant women,  the fear of them losing the immigration always hangs over their heads as a perpetually flashing danger signal.  Why don't you organize and make a  union here?" I asked Saroj after hstening  to her and her co-workers' woes at a smaU  garment unit. "What are you saying behenji  And now a new crunch, a new squeeze  is under way—the proposal to change  Canada's unemployment insurance plan.  These proposed changes wUl adversely affect tens of thousands of immigrant and visible minority workers in the marginalized  weeks of work to qualify for benefits, a cut  from 32 to 27 weeks for benefits paid, and  a reduction from 60 to 50 percent of their  earnings accruing to them in the form of  benefits.  Amar Kaur, a 60 year old farmworker  wrung her hands in despair as she spoke to  me at the farmworkers' demonstration on  May 6th.  "As it is, the season for farm work is delayed this year on account of the severe winter. The snow and frost has practically destroyed the strawberry crop in the lower  mainland area. So we shan't be going to  work untU the end of May or early June.  How on earth can we ever find enough weeks  The placards, written in Hindi, read "Long live the farmworkers struggle," and "Put an end to the 16 week rule."  (sister)?" Saroj looked aghast; "The Canadian government wiU have us deported."  There was not a single woman at that  garment factory who had not been in  Canada for less than ten years. They can be  pushed flat against the waU, squeezed and  crunched and they won't squeal. How much  more of a meek labour force can the employers ask for than these who do not even  know the language? And if any rumblings  of discontent do appear to emanate from  any quarter, the source is immediately physicaUy removed, without any compunctions.  For no labour law and no regulation touches  the conditions under which these immigrant  and visible minority women toU and waste  away   of work on B.C.'s farms to qualify for joo-  aiee-cee (U.L)? And now they tell us that  this woman minister, Barbara McDougaU, is  going to increase the weeks and reduce our  joo-aiee payments—what kind of a woman  is she if she cannot feel for us women? It  wUl be a severe winter for us."  None of the South Asian women workers  I spoke to found any consolation in the fact  that some $1.3 billion wUl be redirected towards training and job re-entry programs  for them. "These training programs are not  for the hkes of me," said Vidyawati. "I  cannot even read and write, and I do not  speak any Enghsh—what good wiU these  programs do for me?"  Darshan, a young mother of two who  works at a cannery added, "For three years  I have been trying to get into an ESL (English as a second language) class, with no  success. I have been told that there are no  ESL classes in the vicinity where I hve. Besides, even if I do manage to lug my chUdren  and myself by bus to some centre where  ESL classes are held, either the timings are  very inconvenient, or else I just do not know  where to get information from. How can I  attend a training program when I do not  find it possible even to learn Enghsh?"  All these immigrant and visible minority women who constitute the seemingly  docUe workforce are not stupid or dumb.  They know precisely where the-ehoe pinches  and where they stand to lose. At a raUy  organized by the Canadian Farmworkers  Union on May 6th, approximately 1,200  South Asian women and men gathered at  the Queen Elizabeth Plaza and marched to  the steps of the Vancouver Art GaUery to  protest the proposed changes in the U.L legislation. The mood was militant, and a sense  of impending doom apparent. "We have to  stand together or else we'll aU sink," said  the placard-waving Pritam Kaur.  I couldn't agree more with her, but  on looking around at those marching and  protesting, a deep unease settled in my  stomach. Even in their struggle these immigrants and visible minorities seemed to  be isolated and alone. Apart from a handful of non-South Asians who have supported  the farmworkers' cause since the inception  of the union, none of those progressive Vancouverites who turn up at the Peace March  in tens of thousands were there that day  to express their solidarity with these struggling workers. WhUe it was heartening to  see a few high profile trade unionists take  their turn at the speaker's platform to voice  their concerns over the farmworkers' phght  in militant rhetoric, none of them had mobilized workers from the organized contingent  of the labour movement they represented.  As the TV cameras roUed and the reporters scribbled away furiously, the immigrant and visible minority women, many  with httle chUdren clinging to them, stood  in sUent anger with their placards aloft.  And they scanned the faces of the passersby,  some of whom out of curiousity hung around  the periphery, for traces of support and solidarity.  The India Mahila Association, an  organization of South Asian women,  is planning a signature campaign to  petition the government on the proposed changes to the U.I regulation.  We appeal to you to help us in this  effort. For further information contact: Jyoti Sanghera, 420-2972; Ramin-  der Dosanjh, 325-3327; Balinder Johal,  327-1885; Harminder Sanghera, 325-  1662.   With respect to chUd custody the report  finds that whUe women receive custody of  their chUdren in 80 percent of uncontested  custody cases, men win custody in at least  50 percent of contested cases. Courts often  leave women seeking custody in a double  bind, on the one hand preferring to award  custody where the mother stays home to  look after the chUdren and on the other  hand favoring a stable economic position to  an unstable or dependent one. Either way  the woman, "risks losing custody to the father who is economically better off.  "Mothers also experience a double bind  in raising aUagations of sexual abuse of children. Many courts seem to require the criminal standard of proof 'beyond a reasonable  doubt' even in family law cases; if the evidence is insufficient to satisfy waht may be  an unfair standard, these mothers risk losing custody under the new "friendly parent" rules of the Divorce Act, 1985 which  provide that the parent who is most wUling  to facilitate access to the other parent shall  be preferred in custody cases."  The report repeatedly makes the point  that wUe laws may be neutral in design and  intent they are often applied or interpreted  in ways that are unfair to women.  Equality  costs  by Kinesis Staff Writer  A recent report by the Canadian Advisory CouncU on the Status of Women  (CACSW) has found that the equahty protection of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms are beyond the reach of the people  who need them most.  The report, which assesses the impact of  the seven year old Charter, shows that of  the 600 court decisions involving the equality guarantees section only 44 or seven percent involved equahty between women and  men.  According to Sylvia Gold, CACSW president, "This percentage is smaU considering  the interest in Charter rights women have  shown, the range of social, economic and legal inequalities that they experience, and  the fact that women comprise the majority  of the population of Canada."  "Even more troubling is the fact that  only seven cases were initiated by or on behalf of women."  The equahty provisions are speUed out in  Section 15 of the Charter, which says that  every individual is equal before and under  the law and has the right to equal protection  and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and in particular without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental  or physical disabihty.  CouncU research says that their preliminary findings indicate that lack of money  is the main obstacle disadvantaged groups  face and it urges the federal government  to provide financing for equahty challenges.  Their analysis shows that chaUenges under  the Charter are more hkely to deal with  drunk driving, economic regulations or civU  procedure than with systemic discrimination.  Further government financing, the councU recommends, should be used to help  those who face discrimination develop expertise related to the Charter and also encourage them to work with other people  to develop "strategic equahty rights litigation." The councU is also calling on the federal government to extend the Court Challenges program, which is due to expire by  March, 1990, and to expand its mandate  which has been used to pay for chaUenges  to federal laws only.

They began to see that there  were a lot more of us than they had  thought. We were breaking with the  life style handed down from the Judeo-  Christian religion, where the woman  had to fulfill a defined role of mother  inside her home.  But I want to say that before the  mothers, who were at that moment defying the military dictatorship, there  were thousands of women who gave  their lives, who fought—together with  men—and who were brutally tortured.  Many of them gave birth to their children under the most inhuman conditions imaginable, and they showed incredible valour.  There are testimonies that tell of  young women giving birth under guard,  without even being allowed to touch or  caress their newborn child. We know of  egates attended the conference at considerable personal risk, given the current situation inside their countries.  Why hold a conference on the disappeared in Latin America in Canada?  The support and solidarity of the Canadian people for Nicaragua and other countries in struggle is weU-known in Latin  America. People look to Canada as a developed country, a neighbour of the United  States with influence in the world. Although they know the limitation of this kind  of thinking, many Latin American human  rights activists want to encourage Canadians to continue to participate, to continue  to care, and to use their relative freedom  of the press and other media to increase international pressure and awareness of this  problem.

It attempts to get rid of people who might be  troublesome to the status quo and it prevents the creation of popular martyrs since  there is usuaUy no body that can be used  as evidence.  Who are the disappeared? In many Latin  American countries, anyone who speaks out  against injustice, or who takes an active role  in her union, or who is even suspected of  being "communist" (a catch-aU word that  has been used to destroy many people) can  become a target. Sometimes famUy members of activists disappear, as a warning to  others. One of the members of the Argentine military junta once remarked: "A terrorist is not just someone with a gun or a  bomb. He (sic) can also be someone who  spreads ideas that are contrary to western  and Christian, civilization."  ChUdren have also disappeared. One of  the strongest presences at the conference  was the Grandmothers of the Plaza de  Mayo. For over 12 years, the Mothers  have congregated every Thursday in Buenos  Aires' main square, wearing pictures of their  Mujeres en accion  Rompamos el silencio!!  El 10 de mayo una feminista peruana, Cecilia Olea, ha sido amenazada de muerte por el  comando paramihtar de derecha autodenominado "Rodrigo Franco." Cecilia es militante  del movimiento feminista peruano, espacio desde el cual realiza sus actividades en favor de  la igualdad de la mujer, la construction de la paz, la defensa de la vida y la alegria,  Hace mucho tiempo las mujeres decidimos romper el sUencio. Perpetuada por cualquiera  de sus actores, denunciamos la violencia domestica, las violaciones, la marginacion per-  manente que tenemos en la sociedad: no nos caUamos cuando una mujer es torturada o,  como nuestra companera Consuelo Garcia, asesinada impunemente el 13.02.89; tampoco  nos caUamos frente a los asesinatos, las masacres y las desapariciones por el convencimiento  de que el sUencio nos aisla, nos paraliza y nos hace mas vulnerables al permitir que fuerzas  extranas dominen nuestras vidas.  El Peru vive en estos momentos una situation donde grupos terroristas y grupos paramU-  itares estan imponiendo una logica de guerra y enfrentamiento en el pais. Denunciamos y  expresamos energicamente nuestra condena a la violencia venga de donde venga.  Frente a la amenaza a nuestra companera Cecilia y a muchas otras personas exigimos  la investigacidn exhaustiva y sancion al Uamado "Comando Rodrigo Franco" y a todos los  grupos que estan amenazando la construccion de la paz en nuestro pais.  A nivel nacional estamos Uamando a las mujeres y hombres a romper el sUencio y unirnos  alrededor de las iniciativas por la paz, y Uamamos a la solidaridad internacional a unirnos  en un abrazo por la vida.  Las diversas organizaciones feministas en el Peru nos hemos unido y comprometido a im-  pulsar esta campana para promover la conciencia publica internacional sobre la situacion  de violencia en nuestro pais.  Peruvian feminist threatened  On May 10th, 1989 a Peruvian feminist, Cecilia Olea, was sent a death threat by a right-  wing death squad called "Rodrigo Franco."  Cecilia is a leading Peruvian feminist, working for women's rights, peace issues and protection of human rights and freedoms.  It's been a whUe since as women we have been speaking out. We have been denouncing  violence against women in the home, rape, the ongoing marginalization of women in society, whoever may be responsible for this. We are not sUent when a woman is tortured or  hke our companera, Consuelo Garcia, murdered with impunity, on February 13th of this  year. Nor do we keep sUent when people are massacred, assassinated or disappeared.  We know that sUence isolates us more, paralyzes us and makes us more vulnerable as it  aUows outside forces to control our hves.  At this moment in time, Peru is facing a situation where terrorist and paramilitary  groups are imposing a strategy of confrontation and war throughout the country. We  strongly condemn the use of such violence regardless of its source.  In response to this death threat to Cecilia and to many other people, we demand an exhaustive investigation and punishment of the Rodrigo Franco group and aU other groups  threatening the buUding of human rights here in Peru.  At the national level, we caU on both women and men to break the sUence and unite  around actions for peace and we caU on international solidarity to unite in an embrace for  hfe.  The different femimst organizations in Peru have united in the commitment to initiate  this campaign to awaken international attention to the situation of violence in Peru.

Forty percent of those who disappeared  during the years of military dictatorship  were women, and about ten percent of them  were pregnant at the time of their disappearance. Their chUdren were born in concentration camps. Where are those chUdren  now? That is what the Grandmothers of the  Plaza de Mayo are asking.  The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo  beheve that the chUdren have a right to  know about their families of origin.

Nerman  Music is often associated with what we  hear as opposed to what we don't hear. Music by women has endured a high level of invisibihty, myth and exploitation within an  industry that wishes women would disappear.  If women weren't prepared to disappear,  then they became part of the packaging  game. Both commercial and progressive radio contribute to the situation, being tentacles of the larger music industry. A lot of  women's music is held back from the hstener on the radio. Because of this, good  music is kept unknown and ignored. Select  women are aUowed to emerge in the industry as they are considered marketable and  commertiaUy viable.  Women's contribution to music has been  undervalued and therefore overlooked. In  the 1950's, women were at the forefront of  the rockabiUy movement which is tradition-  aUy depicted as a male bastion. RockabiUy,  which emerged in the 1940's as an amalgam  of country, swing, Black rhythm and blues  and gospel, flourished commercially from  1954 to 1960. Women rockabiUy performers were new and renowned country stars  who shifted into this mode of music as it afforded them the freedom of a more sexual  and adult sound.  Rose Maddox defied the femimne tradition with her hit "Wild, WUd Young Men,"  where she speaks of a young woman's sexual  aggressiveness. Janis Martin, Wanda Jackson, the Collins Kids and Alvadean Coker  were also big stars. By the early 60's, most  of the male rockabiUy stars had stopped  performing: Elvis had joined the army and  others were embroUed in personal scandals.  Ignoring the female stars, the record companies began to promote a more refined  male teenage sound. The surviving rockabiUy women reentered the country field suc-  cessfuUy and endured the traditional trappings of that particular sound.  Equally unknown is the great swing band  of the 1940's: The International Sweethearts of Rhythm. They were the first multi-  ratially integrated women's dance band and  *mm*mm*0mm**mm0m0m0*im  were popular for over a decade. IronicaUy,  they are never mentioned in any of the  books documenting big bands.  Bands hke the Sweethearts were written  out of history untU historian Rosetta Reitz  began the task of compiling and researching "lost" women's music. Her record label,  Rosetta Records, offers the hstener a rare  opportunity to hear unknown and important recording artists.  The packaging and promotion of women  musicians also affects what we hear or don't  hear.  In 1961 rhythm and blues recording star  Gloria Jones released "Tainted Love." A  decade later the male duo, Soft CeU, produced a hit disco cover of this song. Not  once in their career did these boys credit  Jones with the original. Few people are  aware of her version which is soulful and  passionate: far removed from the disco rip-  off. Her sound and content were revolutionary for the strong girl-group sound influence  of the early 60's.  Ground was further broken at this time  by Betty Everett who recorded the original "You're No Good." This composition  was originaUy intended for male singer Dee  Clark but the producers decided on a female  lead. Everett recorded the song which has  surprisingly femimst overtones. The song  was also a big hit for Linda Ronstadt in the  70's.  Rhythm and blues performer Laura Lee  risked her career to counter sexism within  the 60's sound. At a time when most women  performers were singing stereotypical songs  *mtm&mm#s&-  Patti Smith: a musician who defied packaging and stretched the boundaries of music.  she was recording feminist songs including  "Wedlock is a Padlock" and "Love and Liberty." Her music virtuaUy disappeared from  most catalogues untU a few years ago when  a distributor in England re-released a portion of her music. IronicaUy she remains unknown in her native North America.  These women fought against traditional  packaging and sound when it was unpopular and virtuaUy impossible to do so. It is  no coincidence that their music has been inaccessible and forgotten.  In the 1970's the band LabeUe, comprised  of Sarah Dash, Nona Hendryx, and Patti  LabeUe, originated as an R&B, gospel-based  funk band. Toward the end of their career  they adopted a unique space-queen look,  creating their only miUion-seUing hit, "Lady  Marmalade." Due to the mass popularity of  this song, people forget that LabeUe were  serious, politicized R&B singers, not packaged disco queens.  The WUson sisters (of Heart) were also  victims of artificial standards set by industry. The majority of their early videos show  one of the sisters only from the neck up. She  was too large by industry's standards. How  often are we spared Eddie Van Halen's body  or, for that matter, any male star? The message for women is aU too clear: their look  and sound are synonymous.  This concept is not new. In the 60's, the  Motown sound was also a particular look.  The young women were always Black (but  not too Black), sweet and feminine looking. Often their look was indistinguishable;  hence the phrase "girl-group." Years later  stories emerged about the unprecedented  control producers yielded, as these women  were strictly commodities in the industry.  Commodities need to be packaged and  products need buyers. This applies to more  recent singers such as young women hke  Debbie Gibson, Tiffany and Candi. They  gesture suggestively, throw kisses and ambiguous desires at the audience and camera. We recognize the surface packaging:  see-through and fluffy with an air of seduction, geared to the large young heterosexual  market.  Beyond this fluffy packaging is a more insidious message: youth and their looks are  to be exploited. Recently, on a music award  show, Debbie Gibson, dressed in a white  leather mini-suit positioned herself on top of  a matching piano. She seductively gestured  whUe singing in her innocent and wholesome manner. Her questionable music (at  the best of times) became secondary to her  suggestive movements. Most viewers were  not interested in her music and were focused  on the image or package she was presenting.  Tracy Chapman's involvement with the  music industry's packaging game is less  recognizable but equally manipulative. Her  successful debut album, considered original  and visionary, has defied traditional first-  album sales. For most, she represents a refreshing integrity and talent. The packaging machine of the industry is very aware  of her appeal, and for strictly altruistic reasons, they support her low-key approach to  tours, dress and the media.  Tracy Chapman could be anyone in the  industry's eye. Because she generates a lot  of money, she is left alone in the spotlight.  Easy access to her sound comes from the  dollars generated, not a real commitment to  her pohtics, thoughts or vision. The industry has bought her sound for now. Where  she wUl be aUowed to go from here is difficult to predict.  Over the years, a number of feminist bands have compromised their original  sound and image for commercial success.  The foUowing examples share one common  factor: a desire for a larger audience and  mainstream acceptance. Unfortunately the  original vision and power of their music is  lost in the process.  In the late 70's, the Enghsh band, The  Bodysnatchers, had a strong foUowing for  their hard-core feminist punk music. Artistic differences surfaced within the band as  some members were tired of struggling with  the financial difficulties associated with a  pohtical band. The band disbanded and  resurfaced with a new name and new look.  The Belle Stars, comprised of some of the  original members of The Bodysnatchers,  had a gentler sound and discovered a glamour girl look. Their transformation translated into wider acceptabihty and music  that was fluffy and non-threatening: pure  pablum.  Amazulu, a British reggae band was at  the forefront of pohtical protests for the  Greenham Common peace camp. It was  common to see this dynamic band at most  pohtical benefits in England. Their music encompassed the beat of reggae yet  their lyrics broke away from the tradition-  aUy misogynistic reggae form. Often they  spoke of women's power, the need to heal  our planet against nuclear devastation. Recently they recorded an album which is so  hght-weight it is embarrassing. One of the  songs could be a commercial for Club Med.  Like the Belle Stars, they look seductive and  inviting: an image contrary to their origins.  There are women who have resisted and  rebeUed against the artificial dictates of  commercial success. In 1984, DalbeUo released an album titled "Whomanfoursays."  What is remarkable about this release is the  transformation that occurred for its composer and singer. Lisa DalbeUo was a highly  packaged and successful disco singer in the  70's whose career was completely controUed  by her family and manager. Anyone who is  familiar with her early work wUl acknowledge her powerful voice which was almost  obscured by the disco setting. Most of the  material was offensive and demeaning, reducing Lisa DalbeUo to a packaged entity.  DalbeUo (dropping the Lisa of her past)  broke away from this commercialism and  after a number of years of healing released "Whomanfoursays." The album features DalbeUo on the cover in dramatic war  paint. The album is visionary and complex,  encompassing subjects such as cluld abuse,  sexuahty, and the darker side of relationships. It is not an easy album, demanding  real hstening and thought. The critics ignored it and most people associate the album with her early work. Her anger at her  family and loss of personal control is explored in gripping detaU.  Her strength hes in her ability to aUow  her anger to be the driving force behind her  expression. This translates into thoughtful  mm*tm  Sinead O'Connor: the media has been negligent in representing women artists who step  out of stereotypical sound and packaging.  and original sound. Because conditioning  teaches women otherwise, this form of expression is rare, and virtuaUy ignored when  it occurs.  Madonna has received a lot of coverage  recently regarding the video of her latest  single, "Like a Prayer," which has received  criticism for its overt religious symbolism.  As a result of criticism of her video, Pepsi  Cola has puUed out of a million dollar ad  campaign with Madonna.  Whatever else we may think about  Madonna, she has always maintained control over all aspects of her career. Obviously this does not sit weU with an industry that values power over women artists.  Her Pepsi Cola spot has been replaced by a  male singer surrounded by a pack of women  who are identicaUy dressed, heavUy made-  up, shuffling mindlessly whUe constantly deferring to the male throughout the ad. By  the industry's standards, this is less threatening and harmful than a woman who retains her power and creates controversy.  Patti Smith is a musician who defied  packaging and industry direction. In the  early 70's, she arrived on the New York  music scene and destroyed aU preconceived  theories of music. Already an acknowledged  music critic and poet, she began to set her  poems to music. Her hve performances and  records stretched the boundaries of music.  In 1974 she released what is considered  the first punk rock record, "Hey Joe b/w  Piss Factory." She introduced the world to  the concept of androgyny and claimed the  rock-musitian-as-shaman role traditionaUy  reserved for males. When asked about being such an important woman in the music  industry, she rephed, "It's better than being dead."  Patti Smith created an audience with her  uncompromising and original sound. This is  a critical distinction form the norm. Music is often packaged and produced with a  particular audience in mind. The concept  of creating an audience aUows musicians  artistic freedom and autonomy. However,  this artistic freedom and autonomy cannot  be financially viable if audiences continue to  purchase and support mainstream industry  and its musical dictates.  Kate Bush has also been creating her  audience for the past 15 years. OriginaUy  signed with EMI at the age of 16, her car  reer has maintained her experimental and  unique sound.  For most of her recording ventures she  has had the almost unprecedented position  of being her own producer. She is able to  work within her own personal schedule and  rarely tours. She also maintains her own  recording studio and is able to have control of all aspects of her recording, which is  considered unusual and for most women is  a privUege.  Another form of audience has been created by "traditional" women's music distributor, Olivia Records. This recording  company packages and distributes a distinct lesbian sound, which translates into  the Olivia sound. Women artists who venture into the more avant-garde, punk or less  The International Sweethearts of Rhythm: the first multi-racial integrated dance band  are never mentioned in any of the books documenting big bands.  AINES1S  acoustic mode have httle hope, or desire, to  be represented by this company.  Those lesbians who are enjoying a degree of mainstream commercial success remain hidden in closets that just seem to  be getting bigger every day. In interviews  with some of these women they are adamant  about not discussing their sexuahty.  It seems that, as they succeed, they disassociate more from their lesbianism and their  sisters who have supported them from day  one. Their sUence is part of a cycle that reinforces the behef that lesbians really do not  exist.  Fear of reprisal is a popular excuse yet  internalized homophobia is not. Things wUl  never change untU these women, and others,  address their homophobia and realize that  their sexuahty is something to celebrate-  not to fear.  Vancouver songwriter Ferron is one of  the rare examples of a singer who has managed to balance her lesbian roots with a successful career. Contrary to most marketing  strategies, she has consciously decided to reject a number of lucrative recording contracts in order to maintain control of the  production and distribution of her material.  Within our respective communities there  needs to be an acceptance and welcoming  toward a broader definition of women's music. There are many musicians who are attempting to work beyond a particular dictate. At the same time women need to  be more discerning about accepting most  mainstream music.  Recently whUe d.j.ing a women's dance,  I was approached by a group of women who  insisted that I play "Under my Thumb"  by the Rolhng Stones. I explained that the  lyrics were offensive, as were the Rolling  Stones. They rephed that they hked the  sound and did not care about the lyrics because they never hstened to them. Music  co-exists with lyrics at aU times. Words are  powerful, pohtical and transformative. Music around us today does not recognize or  service these essential qualities.  Recently a number of "new" women musicians are making inroads in this long neglected area. Tanita Tikarum, Toni ChUds,  Sinead O'Connor and Julia Fordham are  creating their special and deeply personal  artistic worlds against long odds. The media treats their existence as a new phenomena, yet outside the commercial world,  women musicians have existed and struggled against great barriers for a long time.  The media, particularly radio, has been  negligent in representing women artists who  attempt to step out of stereotypical sound  and packaging. Progressive radio could be  a strong voice in creating an audience for  women's music, yet it isn't. The programming is weighted towards male bands and  vocalists. Programs focusing on women and  music (stUl considered a specialty area)  are strictly band-aid solutions. Their much-  needed presence is used to obscure the  real need for equal programming. Music by  women should not be in the minority but  equaUy represented on radio.  Music by women has risen visibly against  false assumptions and barriers. Women's  talent and importance should no longer be  a surprise to the industry. It is time to demand that the access to all music by women  should no longer be the exception.  Lauri E.

With a  $1.4 million budget, "Celebration '90—Gay  Games III and Cultural Festival" wUl run  day and night for eight days, bringing 5,500  athletes, 3,500 artists and 12,000 gay and  lesbian visitors from as far away as Sydney,  Australia to join in the fun.  The Gay Games were conceived in 1980  by the late Dr. Tom WaddeU, a former U.S.  Olympic decathelete. Disenchanted with  the Olympics' exclusivity and emphasis on  competition, he dreamt of creating an international event in which anyone could participate, an arena that could accept the whole  person, whatever his or her background or  hfestyle might be.

For complete news and information  about all Celebration '90 events, pick up the  official newsletter of Gay Games III at the  MVAAA office, at Ariel, Little Sister's, and  many other locations.  This dream became reality in 1982  when the first Gay Games—"ChaUenge '82"  brought over 1,300 gay and lesbian athletes  to San Francisco to compete in 14 sports.  Four years later, Gay Games II—"Triumph  in '86" drew 3,500 lesbians and gays to San  Francisco to participate in 17 sports and the  simultaneous "Procession of the Arts."  Gay Games III—"Celebration '90" completes the fulfillment of WaddeU's original  dream by giving the Games their first international venue. And hke its predecessors,  Celebration '90 wUl be the biggest gay and  lesbian event held in North America next  year. Thousands of athletes, artists and visitors wUl create and enjoy a spectacular array of sporting competitions and cultural  exhibits. (See box for a complete hst.)  The roster of 27 sports includes the usual  track and field contests along with many  non-traditional categories hke darts and  softbaU, whUe Cultural Festival offerings  wUl range aU the way from street-style entertainment to full-scale productions at the  Orpheum.  Though participants in the sporting  events are usually referred to as "athletes,"  Betty Baxter, a Co-founder of Metropolitan Vancouver Arts and Athletics Association (MVAAA), the parent body producing Celebration '90 emphasizes, "We've got  to dispel the idea that you need to have a  certain level of ability to participate in the  sports events." The point of these Games is  to have fun doing your personal best. There  are no elimination or qualifying rounds, and  no minimum fitness standards to be met—  anyone who wants to can come out and play.  Gay Games organizers call this the "principle of inclusion," and are fuUy committed  to it in every way.  Peg Grey, a Chicago woman who ran  her first marathon at Gay Games II, confirms this: "In the Gay Games, it is definitely participation by anyone who wants  to. In '86 I participated as a 41 year old  who hadn't run for a long time. What meant  the most to me was being able to complete the marathon running as a lesbian athlete." With her own determination and encouragement from support people along the  course, she did finish the 26 mUe run. Peg  describes her experience as the "highlight  of my athletic career," and encourages everyone to participate, adding, "It's probably the one thing you'U remember in this  decade."  The Cultural Festival has a very exciting  program of music, theatre, cinema, literature, dance and much more in the works.  It is impossible to do justice to the depth  and variety of the planned exhibitions with  a simple outhne (see box), but a couple of  examples wUl serve up a taste of things to  come.  The Women's Music and Culture celebration wUl be a gala evening at the Orpheum.  With a programme including at least five  major names in women's music, and a weU-  known lesbian comedienne as Master of Ceremonies, Cultural Co-Chair Debra Harrison anticipates a 2,800 seat seU-out: "We  can't release the artists' names as contracts  haven't been signed yet, but beheve me, you  won't want to miss this one."  And the Literary Festival features daUy  morning panel discussions (on topics hke  writing our gay and lesbian history, censorship, and humour); afternoon workshops  (on racism, journal-keeping, dream work,  playwriting and poetry); and early-evening  readings by favourite gay and lesbian authors as weU as some new hterary voices.  With similarly exciting offerings coming up  in each Cultural category, it's hard to say  which wUl present the biggest chaUenge:  choosing amongst the many avaUable temptations or trying to get last-minute tickets!  In spite of MVAAA's genuine commitment to having equal participation by  women and men in organizing the Games,  the women's community has been slow to  respond, viewing the Games as a largely  male, "jock-oriented" event. Consequently,  women's involvement in the planning committees is currently running at about one-  third of total participation instead of the  hoped-for one-half. This is unfortunate because women are missing a great opportunity to have fun and develop their abilities  in a very open and positive environment.  Those women who are already involved  generate a contagious enthusiasm for the  Games that is hard to resist. Debra Harrison, Production Manager for the Vancouver  Opera, explains: "It's just hke a fever—you  catch it and you think, this is wonderful.  This is wonderful."  As one of three people with overaU responsibility for pulling off the Cultural Festival, Debra is disappointed by the smaU response from women in the arts. "Hyou want  to see a lesbian presence in the Cultural  side, you've got to get involved. The only  predominantly lesbian event at this point is  the Women's Music and Culture night. We  need more women and would hke to see proposals from visual artists—sculptors, filmmakers, photographers, painters and so on."  Coreen Douglas, a professional fundraiser  serving on MVAAA's Board of Directors,  is also concerned by women's lack of participation. She beheves, "One of the ways  you make something hke this happen is by  getting out in the community and bringing  all those resources and talents in." She beheves that Celebration '90 wUl change the  hves of everyone it touches and give our  lesbian and gay communities a legacy of  strength and pride in having accomplished  aU the fundraising, campaigning and education needed to make a success of an  international-scale production.  When asked about Celebration '90's commitment to the principle of inclusion in athletics, Coreen mentioned the recent International Gay and Lesbian Aquatics Meet,  which was in part a test run for the Gay  Games aquatics division organizers. "After  the swim meet, I got a really great feehng  that the Games really were here to participate in at your own level."  And though Mary Brookes—Celebration  '90's office manager—describes herself as  decidedly non-athletic, she intends to enter  at least one sporting event because, "I think  it's the kind of a thing where if you don't,  you'U be sorry later on."  Debra, Coreen, Mary and many others  aU urge women to get involved in this celebration. You don't have to be a "jock,"  male, "out" or even lesbian or gay—anyone  can participate. You needn't be tied to a  major commitment—there are many short-  term, small-scale tasks to accomplish. And  given the scope of this enormous undertaking, there's a place for every woman's special skiUs.  Volunteers are needed now on the Housing, Registration and Transportation Committees. Women looking for a chaUenge  should try assuming Co-Chair responsibility  for Marketing, Finance, Croquet, Physique  or In-Town Outreach. And experienced  writers, graphic artists and soccer referees  are sorely needed too.  Along with the excitement of making the  Games happen, many of the women volunteers cite increased confidence in their abilities and the chance to get to know very  diverse elements of our community as special rewards of working for Celebration '90.

She is weU aware of the controversy  surrounding her profession, but must constantly balance the pohtical fight with the  need to get on about the business of birthing  babies. In the country where she was trained  and hcensed, home birth is backed up by  the hospital system. She had advisors, ambulances and other medical personnel to  draw on. In B.C., she operates in a shadowy netherland of Ulegality, and without  the support of other medical personnel. H  something goes wrong, instead of getting  help, she may face charges of "practicing  medicine without a license."  H the Registered Nurses Association of  B.C. gets its way, "autonomous" midwives  hke the woman who assisted me wUl never  become legitimized. In a recent position paper, the RNABC argues instead for "nurse  midwifery"—midwifery as a specialty of  nursing.  "... so that all women  can have choices about  how to give birth"  They say "RNABC recognizes that there  are non-nurse midwives in British Columbia  who have been formally educated and certified in other countries. However, the Association is not convinced that the non-nurse  midwife is a viable concept in the British  Columbia health care system at this time.  RNABC does not therefore support the concept of midwifery as an autonomous and  self-regulating health discipline."  In a strongly worded reply to the RNABC, the Midwives Association of B.C. defends its position that midwives should be  an autonomous profession. "Midwifery is a  profession different from but complementary to nursing." They say, "... The midwife is expected to have diagnostic skiUs relating to both mother and baby that are at  one level similar to the obstetrician ..."  The Midwives Association is a self-  regulating organization with set standards  for practice and a peer review process.  "We're probably overcautious," one midwife remarked, "but we have to be." The  30 members of the association are trained  and hcensed in other countries. Midwives  provide pre- and post-natal care for mother  and chUd. Monitoring occurs throughout  the pregnancy and labour and if necessary,  midwives transfer the mother to hospital.  In June of 1988, a coroner's inquest held  after the trial of midwife Lee SaxeU concluded that midwives should be legalized  and given autonomous professional status  when dealing with low-risk obstetrics. The  inquest went on to urge the Grace Hospital to "be receptive to incoming phone calls  from midwives who are informing of pending arrival and condition of mother." The  Socred government, despite having struck  an internal task force to look into the matter, has yet to respond.  "I deal with the legal status by not  dealing with it," says Linda Knox, a  spokeswoman for the Midwives Association  of B.C. "My chents are fuUy aware of the  risk I am taking and the risk they are taking." Despite what she describes as "media sensationalism" surrounding two recent  trials involving midwives, she says she has  never been busier. About 80 percent of her  work involves supporting homebirths. The  other 20 percent involves labour support in  hospital.  Currently, only 1-2 percent of B.C.  women give birth at home. In countries  hke HoUand, where midwifery is a hcensed  profession, the ratio is around 40 percent.  Homebirth and midwifery are often seen  as synonymous, but they are not necessarily. The RNABC beheves that if nurse-  midwives were avaUable, women currently  choosing homebirth would opt for hospital  births with midwife support.  This may be based on a wrong assumption about why women choose homebirth. I toured the Grace Hospital, cur-  of mouth—from other mothers, physicians,  pre-natal teachers, etc."  Parents who opt for midwives as labour  support or in homebirth tend to be weU  informed. In recent years, pre-natal classes  and books on woman controUed chUdbirth  have become widely avaUable. However, if  you're not in the know, or you hve out in  New Westminster, you could end up giving  birth strapped to a table with your feet up  in stirrups, baby straining against gravity—  Canada is the only industrialized nation in the world that does  not have legally sanctioned midwifery.  rently the maternity hospital of choice for  informed parents-to-be. It offers special  birthing rooms, showers, cassette players  (bring your own labour music) and some  flexibility about procedures. However, it is  definitely a hospital. I chose to give birth  at home because I wanted to be in my own  environment. I didn't want to have to deal  with a lot of strangers at such a vulnerable  time in my hfe.  When I was carrying my daughter, many  people told me I was "brave" to be planning a homebirth. After hearing dozens of  hospital birth stories in pre-natal classes, I  decided it was the women who were going  into hospital who were brave.  I heard of inductions, episiotomies, nurses  who were either intrusive or cold, doctors  who arrived at the last moment or not at aU.  I heard women speak proudly of how as a  result of their pre-natal training, they were  able to assertively reject unwanted medical interventions or prevent the nurse from  whisking away the newly born baby. All I  could think was—why should they have to?  Canada has a cesarean birth rate of 20-  25 percent. The World Health Organization  hsts 12-15 percent as average, and in Holland the rate hovers between 4-6 percent.  "Those women are buUt the same as our  women," Linda Knox remarked. "The difference is the care avaUable. When you limit  choices, you create pathology."  Linda Knox beheves that more Canadian women would choose homebirth if they  had access to trained midwives. "Obviously I can't advertise for business," Knox  says. "People get to me mostly by word  aU for the doctor's convenience. There is  also an economic factor. Although most  midwives operate on a shding fee schedule,  they cannot afford to work for free.  "IdeaUy we would hke to be an autonomous profession fully integrated with  the health care system. We want access to  diagnostic material, interaction with other  professionals and of course to be covered by  medicare," says Knox.  B.C. is in the middle of a baby boom-  let. Women of the "baby boom" genera  tion are deciding to reproduce. Babies were  listed as "in" for 1989. This spring, the  Grace Hospital announced it wUl be turning away 616 expectant mothers. The current nursing shortage and the erosion of  health care in B.C. has resulted in a system  where some patients are released immediately after operations. In contrast, maternity patients may be urged to stay in hospital an extra day so they can catch the baby  bath demonstration. Legitimized midwifery  could take the pressure off.  There are cases, of course, where medical intervention is absolutely essential. One  woman was so set on a home birth that she  laboured for four days before finaUy consenting to a hospital cesarean. Her pelvis, it  turns out, was simply too smaU to accommodate the baby's head. She would have  died without intervention.  For the vast majority of women, however,  birth happens "normally." That's where  midwives come in. "We want to be legalized not just so that we can practice—but  so that all women can have choices about  how to give birth," says Linda Knox. Knox,  who has practiced midwifery for the past  seven years, came into the profession "by accident." The mother of three chUdren, her  first birth was "very medical."  "After that, I felt women needed to be  more prepared for chUdbirth, so I began  teaching about the process. Women asked  me to come with them as labour support. As  a result, I sought out midwives and began  attending clinics." Linda is now hcensed in  the state of Washington, but began her career as a so-called "lay midwife"—a woman  who learns by experience.  To the RNABC, lay midwives are com-  plicit in what they call "underground  midwifery"—a practice they would hke to  see wiped out. The RNABC is also not in  support of homebirth "unless and untU the  appropriate services are in place."  Linda Knox disagrees. "As long as women  continue to choose the option of homebirth,  we have an obligation to provide them with  care. Canada is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not have legaUy  sanctioned midwifery."  That situation may be changing soon.  IronicaUy, whUe a Montreal physician recently lost his hospital privileges for allowing a midwife to "catch" the baby, the  province of Quebec is now in the process of  legitimizing midwifery. In fact, in the smaU  northern town of Povungnituk, a birthing  clinic staffed solely by midwives is already  in operation. The clinic is a response to  protests by local Inuit women. Prior to its  existence, 90 percent of maternity patients  were flown out of the community to await  the arrival of their babies in southern hospitals. The ratio now averages about 10 percent.  In B.C. it wUl hkely take a change of government for women to get the kind of maternal health service now available in Povungnituk.

In search of  new faces they took a journey into their  own backyard. As a result of that step, more  Vancouver artists than ever are coming to  the annual Jericho Park event, July 14-16.  The hneup of local women has a definite  country flavour, with Terilyn Ryan, The  Dots and Sue Medley aU firmly in that vein,  whUe Mae Moore, Shari Ulrich and Jennifer  West are coming more from a folk base.  I've been in awe of Terilyn Ryan ever  since she got up onstage for a Co-op Radio  benefit two weeks after the birth of her second son. Her bright, clear vocals were fuU  of energy, her timing on rhythm guitar was  impeccable, and she channeUed the driving  force of the dance band through her upfront  presence. She was singing her own songs,  variety of covers in rockabiUy and country  swing styles as weU as a number of originals,  all written by Greer.  Although, as she says, "We cater to everyone," Greer describes herself as a feminist and enjoys the special relationships she  has with the women in the band. "They're  hke my sisters; they're my best friends." She  is glad things in country music have changed  from the time when "you were someone's  girlfriend if you were in the band," but says  it is stUl tough for women musicians. "The  circle is growing, though."  Another up and coming young singer/  songwriter we'U be seeing at the festival is  Sue Medley. Receiving three awards from  the 1988 Tribute to West Coast Music, and  getting ready to put out her first album this  faU, Medley has a gutsy and pretty voice,  and a smooth, polished presentation.  Among aU these newly recognized artists  wUl be a woman with many years of recording and performing behind her, both solo  and with various groupings including Pied  Pumpkin. After getting together for the  closing of last year's folk festival, Pied  Pumpkin is on the road again this summer  Tremblay, who has made a name for herself  on the women's label, Olivia, in California,  But she is equaUy popular in women's circles throughout Canada. She has the knack  of writing songs that are thoroughly romantic but also truthful, and her delivery is  clear and brimful of feehng.  Lillian AUen brings her feehngs to the audience in a rub-a-dub style, doing her dub  poetry with a full reggae band, the Revolutionary Tea Party Band. On her recommendation we'U be hearing another group of  Black Torontonians, putting out their message in rap or "hip hop" as they call it. Tissa  FarreU, Thando Hyman, M.C. Motion and  D.J. Power are three women and a man, aU  in their teens, who have been appearing at  Toronto demos lately caUed to protest pohce kUlings of two young Black men. It'U be  full of interesting characters and real human  responses to real hfe situations.  Nor is regular performing with her band,  Linedriver, her only occupation other than  motherhood. She is politically active as weU.  She was behind the campaign two years  ago to preserve Canadian content rulings on  country music stations.  If that weren't enough, Ryan has made  space for her own and other women's music by starting up Hen Night and Feathered  Pens at the RaUway Club. Perhaps this is  one of the reasons for the upswing in country music in this town, particularly among  women. These events are set up for women  performers, and in the case of Feathered  Pens, the material is aU original.  Says Tami Greer of The Dots, "These  events have opened a lot of doors for women.  There aren't enough gigs on the alternative  scene, and this has given us something to  strive for. It's somewhere to showcase material, giving us a reason to find the musicians  to work with, to get our material together,  and maybe go on from there to record a  demo. It's a real incentive to women performers."  Greer speaks from experience. The Dots,  a roots band with emphasis on rockabiUy,  was formed in order to host a Hen Night,  and although it has gone through several  changes in personnel, the core group of  Greer on lead vocals, Reg McDonald on guitar and vocals, and Joanie Kepler on bass  and vocals is stUl together, belting out those  three part harmonies that are its trademark. With Jimmy Roy on lead guitar and  ReveUie Nixon on drums, the band does a  Mae Moore, a folk/rock singer/songwriter, is less than enthusiastic about being associated with the women's movement. "I get  my back up being called a women's musician," she says, "and I won't do women's  concerts. To segregate out hke that—I have  a real hard problem with that. It doesn't  matter what sex you are."  Moore, better known at this point  through her songs than her performances (a  coUaboration with John Dexter, "Heaven in  Your Eyes," was a big hit for Loverboy), has  been doing some recording projects lately  with Barney BentaU and friends, and seems  to be on the verge of big success as a singer  as weU as a songwriter.  with the inimitable Shari Ulrich on vocals,  fiddle, mandolin, guitar and piano.  Looking beyond the local scene, the rest  of Canada is weU represented as weU.  From the North West Territories come the  Inuit Throat Singers. These women (this  is strictly a women's tradition) pair up  and sing into each other's mouths, creating a strange and wonderful sound. The  songs continue untU one breaks into laughter, making it a kind of game.  From Prince Edward Island (by way of  Montreal) comes Theresa Doyle, an accomplished singer in both traditional Celtic balladry and in the field of jazz. Another Mon-  trealer is bilingual baUadeer, Lucie Blue  interesting to see women working in a form  highly dominated by male musicians.  Marie-Lynn Hammond, once of String-  band, also comes at present from Toronto,  where she has been writing plays as weU as  songs and using her melodious voice as a  host on CBC radio. She brings an exceUent  pianist in Marilyn Lerner.  Moving west, Manitoba is represented  by three very different performers. Loreena  McKennitt, on the Celtic harp; Heather  Bishop, weU known feminist singer with a  bluesy style; and Suzanne Bird, a Metis  country singer/songwriter. Though not weU  known outside of Manitoba, Bird has a powerful dehvery toughened by years of playing  the bars, and deserves wider recognition.  And then there are the women from aU  over the world! Some familiar faces, such  as Judy SmaU, Frankie Armstrong, Hazel  Dickens and Barbara Higbie. But, as usual,  many new discoveries for this part of the  world. From Bulgaria come the Bisserov Sisters, bringing that raw power and haunting  beauty associated with Balkan music.  And mention must be made of Mahi-  naarangi Tocker, who is coming all the way  from New Zealand. She is a feminist, pohtical singer/songwriter, half Maori, half Jewish, and has two solo albums out already,  one of them voted best of the year by N.Z.'s  major newspaper.  Of course there are more women than  here mentioned, and there are many mixed  and male groups who wiU no doubt catch  our ears. For the best bargains, get early-  bird tickets, and/or buy as a group (of 15  or more).  .KINESIS Arts  /^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Book undermines equal parenting  by Joni Miller  FROM PRIVATE TO PUBLIC  A Feminist Exploration of Early Mothering  by Amy Rossiter  Toronto: The Women's Press  From Private to Public is Amy Ross-  iter's attempt to find "Something in the  Nothing." As she puts it in her Introduction  "... apparently mothering was made  up of doing Nothing. 'No, I'm not working now;' 'Dr. Ross delivered the baby;'  'I didn't do anything today.' Yet I knew  that all of that Nothingness was in fact  Everything, that is, the reproduction of  the next generation, emotionally and  physically."  I picked up this book eagerly because it  promised a discussion of feminist mothering. The book jacket proclaims, "Including  her own experience as a first-time mother,  as weU as those of three other women,  Rossiter keenly analyzes social factors that  make early mothering both a joyous and  an oppressive experience." Rossiter further  tantalized me with this tidbit:  "... J was therefore stuck on the  horns of a very painful dilemma: I  believed that children's attachment to  their mothers was based on their physical relationship to the maternal body;  yet I understood that same preferential attachment to be implicated in the  maintenance of patriarchy ... On the  other hand, if I opted for equal parenting, I denied my body and my baby.  Trying to make sense of all this in  the real world, I ended up in ridiculously painful situations: for instance,  while my husband was giving an objecting baby a bottle, I would be expressing  milk from an overly-full breast into the  sink."  As the feminist mother of a newborn infant, I wanted the benefit of Rossiter's experience. I wanted to know if she succeeded  in her quest for equal parenting and read  this book avidly—mostly whUe breastfeeding my tiny daughter. Yet, in the end I was  disappointed.  The bulk of the book foUows the case histories of three married women. They were  interviewed shortly before the birth and  periodically for six months afterwards. All  of the women were in fairly conventional  relationships and the pattern was quickly ;  established—the women became the caretakers. Fathers played with the baby a bit or  "helped out" when requested. Mostly, they  seemed to be in the way. The women spent  virtuaUy every day alone with the baby. Not  surprisingly, none of them had a very good  time. Their images of mothering did not  match the reality. Here, Maria describes her  day:  5:80 am She woke up. I changed her  and fed her.  6:30 She falls back to sleep and so do  I.  8:00 She wakes up. I change her and  play with her a little. She is happy and  smiling.  8:20 I feed her.  9:00-9:30 She sits in her chair, on the  kitchen table. She is "gumming" some  toys while I have breakfast and tidy up.  10:00 She starts fussing. I change  her and try to rock her to sleep, but it  doesn't work. She is searching for the  breast, so I give her some (just one  side).  11:00 She is crying. I try to rock her  to sleep, but again rocking alone doesn't  work, so I feed her the other side.  11:30 She is asleep again. I write this  and begin rinsing another load of diapers.  11:40-12:10 She is awake again and  I attempt to put her back to sleep—but  she refuses and is wide awake.

In their view,  the order of things was natural and right.  Two of them eventually returned to paid  work, but continued taking primary responsibility for the baby.  Mothering, as portrayed in this book,  was aU of my worst fears realized—isolation,  boredom, endless guilt, uncertainty and the  repetition of numerous smaU and uninteresting tasks. No intellectual stimulation,  friends disappearing, confinement to the  house.  I looked forward to the Conclusion section. This was where I expected Rossiter  would show us a better way. Unfortunately,  I mostly faUed to understand the heavUy  academic and rhetorical language. Here's an  example:  To break away from the polarization  imposed by culturalist or biologistic ex  planations of the reproduction of mothering is liberating in two ways: it allows for the experienced reality of the  female body, with its physical tie to infants; and it shows that the attachment  born from that physical tie does not necessarily reinforce patriarchy because, as  gender categories are refused, an  fant 's separation is not effected from a  Woman.  When I did understand her, she seemed  to be saying that chUdren and babies must  not be raised away from pubhc hfe—that  work and chUd-rearing ought to co-exist.  Unfortunately, Rossiter offers no examples  of how this could be accomplished. She  never does provide insights into her own experience and options—such as lesbian couples raising babies—are never mentioned. I  was left with the uneasy feehng that equal  parenting is a myth and she just doesn't  want to break the news to us.

VOR 1MO   (604) 248-5410   KINESIS $sss$ss*s***s*s*s^^  Arts  The Pedestal:  Vancouver's first  feminist paper  by Jennifer Ellis  Twenty years ago, in the fall of 1969,  the first issue of The Pedestal newspaper  rolled off the presses and into the hands of  Vancouver feminists. At a cover price of 10  cents for its four pages, the paper's headlines asked readers "Why Picket Trudeau?"  An article on human rights followed, slamming the B.C. government's treatment of  women employees. Another article on teachers in Canada outlined how, "despite the  fact that... the median years of experience  is higher at all levels for women [teachers]  than for men, women predominate in the  lowest categories on the pay scale."  The paper is concluded with "Motherhood: the Myth and the Reality." The author, thought to be a housewife, talks of how  "in this cage called home ... the woman's  independent spirit slowly dies; her confidence in her abilities is sapped; to salvage  some self-regard, the trivia of the household  becomes all important and obsessive with  her and the children are the be-all and end-  all of her existence."  These stories highlight both how far  we've come, and how many things have remained the same. The changes and debates  that occurred within the pages of the paper,  and behind the scenes, provide an important, interesting, and at times even amusing  record of the debates and political goings-  on within the women's movement in Vancouver during its early years.  Originally produced "when possible" by a  committee of the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC), The Pedestal went through  a number of transitions over the six years  it was published—of volunteers, appearance, political focus and even of name. The  Pedestal's founding members "agonized"  over a possible name until finally Maggie  Benston, one of the first members of the paper's collective, suggested the name from a  book she was reading at the time on the suffrage movement, Up From the Pedestal,  feeling it provided the image of somewhere  women could stand up and be heard.  The Pedestal's first issue explained that  "this newspaper hopes to play a role in  building this movement. Through it women  are asked to tell theii own stories—and  discuss together the problems we all face.  Through it, we hope to achieve what women  have never had in this society—a voice of  our own, an organization through which we  can realize the power that we can have as  half the population and one-third of the  workforce."  The content of the first couple of years of  The Pedestal reflects the committee structure of the VWC—there were articles on  working women, on women in education,  and many on abortion. The appearance of  the paper at that time also depended on  who was involved in its production. Jean  produced graphics and artwork are symbolic of the apparent change in the political focus of the paper. Creative writing, a  'dream page,' cartoons, book reviews, and  articles on health education and issues emphasizing personal growth and experience  were added to the more traditionally defined 'political' issues of employment, abortion, legal and political rights.  Articles on lesbian lifestyles and issues  finally began to make the pages of The  Pedestal in 1972. Benston attributes the  previous invisibility of lesbians to a combination of 'the times,' the lack of lesbians organizing politically, and the fact  that many of the strong 'leaders' of The  Pedestal—some of whom were themselves  lesbians—felt the primary need was to organize around social issues. In addition, the  mainstream media's penchant for writing  off the women's movement as being noth-  work it took to produce the paper, a sense  of optimism and perseverance is apparent  when reading The Pedestal years later. A  June 1973 editorial outlining some of the  difficulties and changes occurring behind  the scenes at the paper ends with, "We are  learning to be stronger, and so are women  everywhere. Join us."  In 1974, The Pedestal changed its name  to Women Can to show "growing involvement with all the women's groups in B.C.,  Canada, and all over." However, two issues  later The Pedestal was back; although no  explanation was offered for the transition.  But further change came quickly as the next  issue of The Pedestal changed its standard  subtitle from "the Vancouver Women's Liberation Newspaper" to "A Lesbian-Feminist  Newspaper."  According to Pat Feindel who became involved with the paper at that time, a number of lesbians who felt it was time for  Vancouver to have a lesbian-feminist paper,  Rand, another of The Pedestal's founding  mothers, was then a typesetter at the Peak,  the student newspaper at Simon Fraser University. The Peak offices, and typesetter,  were used to produce the first couple of  years worth of The Pedestal. Jean remembers many 'allnighters' of layout—one  morning she went directly from layout to  her day job at an insurance company; her  friend who dropped her off skipped classes  and went home to sleep.  The philosophy of the early Pedestal collective was to keep it as open as possible, to  allow an influx of women, to keep it accountable, and to provide an area where women  could learn writing and layout skills. A  VWC "Strategy Conference" in June 1970  stated "the key to our view of The Pedestal  is the word 'represent'."  In 1971, the VWC disbanded, but many  of the committees, including the Pedestal  collective, continued with their work independently. Over the next few years The  Pedestal changed dramatically in style.  Multiple colours and an increase in locally  ing more than a 'bunch of man-hating lesbians' had the unfortunate effect of self-  censorship.  A long letter from Helen Potrebenko in  the November 1972 issue, and the replies to  it, highlight the debates about the relationship between feminist and socialist goals,  the relationship between the 'personal' and  the 'political,' and the connection between  lesbian and feminist issues that were going on in the women's movement—and the  Pedestal collective—at the time. The disagreements and the frustration at the differences, resulted in women often leaving  the collective. However, despite the frequent  changes in members, the ongoing financial  squeeze, the all around massive amount of  Disappeared from page 11  were forcibly taken from families that loved  them. In some cases, children were tortured  in front of their parents, or parents in front  of their children.  In 1984, a delegation of Grandmothers  went to Washington, D.C. where they found  some doctors who were willing to work on  developing a blood test that could establish genetic data using the blood of grandparents. In this way they have been able to  establish the identity of just a few of their  missing grandchildren.  The right of these children to know their  own origins has implications for many families here in B.C. On May 12, 1988, the  Vancouver Sun published an article about  Billy Rodgers, a young Native man of Gitksan origin. Billy was one of the more than  4,000 Native children apprehended by the  provincial government and adopted into  non-Native foster homes between 1961 and  1973. Although his grandmother and sister  searched tirelessly for him for nearly two  decades, the family was denied information  as to his whereabouts. Billy, who was the  grandson of a hereditary chief, died in 1986  without knowing who he was or that he had  a family that was looking for him. Today  the Ministry of Social Services and Housing  still refuses to tell his grandmother where  he is buried.  One of the concerns of conference participants are the laws of impunity that are currently being put in place in several countries. Under these laws, individuals responsible for disappearances and other human  rights violations become immune to punishment.  This attempt to erase the past is worrisome for families of the disappeared.  According to Estela de Carlotto, Vice-  President of the Grandmothers of the Disappeared, "Very rarely is one of these people accused and convicted. Some have even  been made out to be heroes. The people responsible for these crimes are walking the  streets today. Some are active in politics.  Some are in the navy, gaining rank. A few  are in prison, but they are treated very well.  There is talk about an amnesty for these  people. H they were to be released through  such an amnesty, no one would be responsible for what has happened."  Another subject for discussion is the  problem of the type of government that  practices human rights violations. Many  people believe that such violations only  take place in countries under military dic  tatorships. In fact, many countries in Latin  America now have constitutionally-elected  governments. It is convenient for foreign  aid, and other reasons, to have a civilian at  the head of a government, but in most cases,  it is still the military that holds the real  power. And before handing over the government, the military made sure it passed self-  amnesty laws first.  Women and Children  The conference workshop on women and  children touched on many of the same issues. Of special concern was the exploitation of children in the workforce and the  problem of the traffic of children in several  Central American countries. (See Kinesis,  March 1989.)  Also discussed was the fact that groups  and individuals seeking justice are often  slandered and defamed by the governments  they are accusing. Groups such as the  Guatemalan Mutual Support Group for  Families of the Detained/Disappeared have  been accused of being destabilizing elements  in society and several of the group's leaders  have been assassinated.  took over the responsibility for the produc-  ' tion of the paper—with the somewhat reluctant permission of the women who had been  putting the paper out but could no longer  find the time, energy or likely the money, to  continue.  The Pedestal meetings moved to the  "Lavender Hill Commune," a house set up  by the same women, and production occurred in the evenings at the workplace of  one of the women. The philosophy of the  new collective was outlined in a letter by  one of the women involved: "... all issues  of interest to lesbians are of interest to feminists ... H the people putting their energy  into the paper are women taking a radical  political stance for women, then it is called  a femimst newspaper. If those people are  lesbian feminists, i.e. totally committed to  the cause of womankind, then it is a lesbian  feminist newspaper."  Apparently only three issues of this 'new'  Pedestal were produced—the last three in  the life of The Pedestal. The October/  November 1975 issue, then 24 pages with a  35 cent cover price, appears to be its last.  The reasons are hazy—it may have been the  ongoing struggle where the lack of finances  and energy eventually won out. But the six  years of hard work and struggle on The  Pedestal now provide an enlightening and  important record for the women's movement in Vancouver. They are well worth the  read!  An almost complete collection of The  Pedestal is available to read at the Main  Library of UBC in Special Collections.  The call number is HQ 1101 P48 VS5.  If anyone would like to write and provide a more detailed account of the last  days of The Pedestal —or other information about it—please do!  , KINESIS //ys/yyyyyyy/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys/y/y/yyy/yyyyyyyyyyyy/y/y/  //////////////////^^^^^  //////////////////////^^^^  Commentary  Young feminists looking for learning  by M.A. Vevick  My younger friends and I are convinced  feminists. We are also ignorant. This has  been pointed out to us, not by the patriarchs and their dupes and hangers on, but  by older feminists, the women I would like  to think of as our older sisters. They taught  themselves much of what they know, and  bear the scars to prove it.  From the viewpoint of a Ph.D. student,  much of what is taught in undergraduate courses is oversimplified or even incorrect. In school they teach the rules, then  the exceptions, and the longer you study  the more exceptions and contradictions you  learn. But without the rules, the exceptions make no sense, the square roots of  negative numbers are fascinating only when  one knows they should not exist. Likewise  learning of Margaret Sanger's conversion to  white supremacist thinking would probably  have affected me more had I known anything else about her. It seems these days  stop excluding all whose minds are not precisely where ours are and start encouraging  and helping them learn.  Women have fought against the ruling  class for long enough, I would have thought,  not to fall into its intolerant habits. Yet one  of the dangers we face is that the women  who have worked longest often lack understanding of their less experienced sisters.  As a sometime computer whiz I understand  how annoying it can be to try explaining advanced concepts to someone who does not  know RAM from ROM. It is easy to shrug  and say—"Come back when you have educated yourself, and we'll talk." Perhaps,  if she seems particularly promising I might  recommend a text or two, or perhaps the  right community college course. Then, if she  never shows interest again, if she keeps right  on doing things the old way, I can always  say, "Oh, she's just computer-phobic, she  secretly hates hackers." It may even be true  by then.  "Let us get together to create... a feminist  dream... which includes... the wisdom of our  veterans, the enthusiasm... of our converts"  that the first I hear of women who have  worked for good causes is that their sins  have finally been discovered.  I am not saying that everyone should stop  what they're doing to start teaching kids  like me their femimst ABC's. Just don't  complain about anyone who is.  Try comparing the average age at 'politically correct' rallies with that of the Moral  Majority representatives outside the clinics  on Harbord and Parliament Streets. One  of the strongest factors contributing to the  current rise of the right seems to be their  presence in the school system. The Ontario  government (i.e. your and my tax dollars)  help fund Catholic schools that bus their  pupils to anti-choice rallies. The long view  sees the young people as the key: few battles are finally won in one generation.  It isn't easy for the more experienced  among us to find the time and patience to  help us to learn. Not everyone is a teacher,  but those who can teach should be encouraged. H we are not to become a highly incestuous movement of small interest groups  fighting each other for the minds of those  already converted, then we must stop taking the easy way out. We must stop fighting  each other and concentrate on fighting the  system that encourages our faults. We must  Some women like reading, love spending  time in libraries or bookstores ransacking  the shelves for that one definitive text that  will explain everything. Others don't. The  majority just don't have time.  While it may have worked for me, consciousness is not most easily raised by frequent applications of politically aware toes  to the rears of those less knowledgeable.  Would it be so difficult to educate gently?  Lend books? Exchange reading lists? Discuss differences without blaming those who  are different? It is not easy to discuss racism  or classism without the words 'white' and  'middle-class' sounding like curses, but it is  possible. We must recognize that our priorities are not going to be everyone's priorities. The ruling monolith can only be disassembled by people working on all fronts.  While dynamiting one boulder, we cannot  afford to drop rocks on those undermining  other areas.  Lastly, though it may be even harder, it  is also important that we discuss our similarities. While various feminist sects have  different final goals, our intermediate goals  are remarkably similar. We are fighting sexual abuse, abuses of working women, and '  the many abuses of women of colour. We  are fighting for choice, and for resources.  I have not decided whether my utopia is  communist, socialist, anarchist or liberal  democratic—is it important? Must I find  the single right answer, by myself, before  you can talk to me?  Some sisters (dare I call them such?) say  that one should not work to reform current society because it just delays The Revolution. This implies that radical change  cannot occur slowly. No revolution yet, but  ask your mother or your grandmother or  your unmarried aunt who lives with a female 'companion' whether or not our society has changed radically.  It is important to teach them, feminists  already, who come seeking involvement. It  is also important to welcome the uncommitted, and encourage their explorations. To  do this we must be able to show a caring  and supportive community. A strong and  united movement which has had victories,  and celebrates them, but which also has a  vision for the future can attract converts.  Given the choice between a conservative vision and no coherent vision at all, people  are either joining the conservatives or giving up in disgust. The result is Toronto municipal elections with a 30 percent turnout,  mayor who thinks world class is miles of cold  glass with no place for people.  Let us get together to create a common  platform, a feminist dream which can give  hope to the one and a half million Toronto-  nians too disillusioned to vote.  A dream which is broad enough to espouse the separate visions of our community for a world that does not discriminate  on the basis of class, race, religion, sex, or  sexual orientation.  A dream for a world that does not exploit the resources of nature or humanity in  the pursuit of more capital for the 10 percent of society that already owns 70 percent  of it all.  A dream which includes planning and action, the wisdom of our veterans, the enthusiasm and fumbles of our converts.  A dream which welcomes and encourages  those who are discovering that the world is  unnecessarily harsh and unjust, and beginning to dream of something better.  A dream, like Pat Parker's "simple  dream," for a world where we can all take  all our parts with us wherever we go without fear of rejection.

I am long past being fed-up with this  so-called "debate" about Rape Relief and  Women's Shelter. For nine of the last ten  years I was a collective member and I am  bone weary of the extra work these very few  women who have left mad have created for  me and many of my co-workers.  While all of this outcry by a handful of  women goes on, transition houses are now  slowly being mandated to death by government's criteria. Transition houses were first  created as a safe place for women going  through a "transitional" period in her life,  often in conjunction with some man's violence. Now across Canada there are houses  who "can't" house women who are raped  and needing safe shelter, are reluctant to  house single women because the first priority is women with kids, who won't house  women leaving common-law husbands or  prostitutes escaping violent pimps, because  it doesn't fit the government enforced criteria. Where is this debate and outcry about  the government taking over and redefining  our work? How is this affecting women who  need safe shelter?  Other criticisms are that we aren't accountable to the government and other  houses are. Since when in the Women's Liberation Movement was this a plus? Many  of us have worked hard trying to figure out  how to stretch the strings which has taken  far too much of our time. We were and are  accountable to the women who call.  About the criticism of women not being satisfied with the support they got  from Rape Relief and Women's Shelter. Any  woman who works in a rape crisis centre or transition house knows not every  woman gets what she wants or is "happy"  when she leaves. Over the years I have  heard a number of complaints from women  who have gone through "other feminist services," some serious, and I have dealt with  them individually.  About women leaving angry and hurt because they didn't get what they wanted as  a member of a feminist group, happens a  lot. Occasionally there are rumours of these  "In fights," but to no degree do they get the  same air time. These fights are also about  structure, training, service, etc., in short differing politics. The attack on Rape Relief  and Women's Shelter is also about politics,  service is not separate.  Over the years I have personally answered numerous accusations and questions  about whether or not I go to court with a  woman, or whether or not I referred women  to the courts, police or hospitals. Yes, in fact  if that's the route a woman wanted to take I  also went with her (so did my co-workers). If  the question is do I push a woman towards  the legal route or tell her she has a responsibility to report, no I do not—and I hope  these women do not either. It's up to the  women to decide, the majority of women I  have talked to have already decided not to  report to the police long before they ever  talked to me.  About whether or not myself and other  women do one to one. I have personally  spent hours and hours working with women  one to one. I also over the years facilitated  a couple of different support, education and  action groups, which a lot of women came  to wanting to talk with other women. Do we  train women? Yes, we have always trained  women working on the crisis lines or in the  house.  I have also read Jan Barnsley's response  in the last issue of Kinesis, and yes, I agree  with her that this political fight has no place  in the mainstream media. But I do not agree  with her that the woman or women responsible are at all naive. I worked with Chris  McDowell for two years and lived with her  for one. She has a fairly comprehensive understanding of what the mainstream media  does to these "in movement" fights. I also  think it was a well thought out tactic because this round has not caused the uproar  of the past. Many feminists are angry that  the media was called in and are almost as  fed-up as I am about these accusations.  This last round has also been called a  "debate," or has been over the years. In the  nine years I've experienced no debate, just  accusations. In this round by a small group  of white, middle class women who do little  or no direct grass roots work with women.  There has also been some question to  whether or not women who are raped and  battered need therapy. That's their decision and I do refer to therapists. But most  women don't want therapy. Mostly women  are looking for some support, to know that  feeling angry, sad, scared, hurt are normal  reactions, looking for safe housing till they  can figure out the next step and help strate-  gizing about how to get what they want.  How do I know this? I've talked to hundreds  of women.  Pamela Fayerman's piece in the Sun and  as well the Kinesis article were both poorly  researched. No one has asked me or anyone I know who continue to refer to and  support Rape Relief and Women's Shelter  or work with similar politics, our opinions.  I am particularly angry with Kinesis, because I expect fair, well researched coverage  from your workers. Many of us wrote to the  Sun which has refused to print our letters.  In my opinion this has distorted a class fight  and once again turned what could be an interesting debate into a three ring circus hiding the issues. And the bottom fine is, so we  disagree? So what? Get on with your work,  lam.  And last but not least, while all of this  is going on, men continue to get off the  hook. We have a common enemy—men's violence and sexism in general—let's get back  to fighting men's violence.  Kim Nightingale  Kinesis:  To Chris and the women involved in this  last attack on Rape Relief:  I'm tired of Chris' attack! I'm tired of lies  about my work, my life, my motives.  I'm fed up with middle class women who  write and speak about what is good for me  (the victim), and what I'm good for.  Nine years ago, I came to Rape Relief to  volunteer and Chris, you welcomed me then.  I love women, I wanted to help, I never realized how good it would be for me.  But, I'm fed up with the garbage that  some women are still saying about my crisis  work and my feminist politic.  I'm 42, a single parent, a lesbian, working  class and proud. I work hard, I love hard,  I expect a lot of myself and others and I'm  firm in my commitments. I deserve respect  for the woman's work I've done, crisis counselling, advocacy, politic, housework and direct action. I deserve it and I demand it.  I'm fed up with being lied about behind my  back.  I'm on a break now from crisis work. I'm  tired and it's Chris' turn. Put your labour  where your mouth is and help 100 women  escape male violence this year—in my place.  The beatings go on!!  In sisterhood Trying,  V.J. Fishman  Jiwan Fishman  Kinesis:  I am writing in response to Jan Barns-  ley's letter, published in the May issue of  Kinesis, regarding the decision of myself  and two other women to "go public" regarding our concerns about Vancouver Rape Relief.  Jan states that we were "tragically naive  about the mainstream media." She also  fears that "those very women who most  need to know what services are available to  them in Vancouver," will now be "confused  and misled" regarding the services available  to them.  How condescending. So we are naive, and  "those women" are too stupid to make sense  of a newspaper article.  Jan says that we acted "independently  without consulting or even informing other  femimsts." For nine years I have been working on the problem of what to do about  Rape Relief. I've talked about it, met about  it, done everything I could think of to make  as many people as possible aware of Rape  Relief's terrible and damaging "services" to  women and children.  This talk has been mainly limited to  women who consider themselves feminists—  a lot of the same women who attended the  "in-movement" meetings in the late 70's  and early 80's. But all along I have wondered, short of actually being able to close  Rape Relief down, how I can make the situation known to the women who are most  likely to call their crisis line, or stay at their  house. These women don't necessarily belong to feminist organizations, or read Kinesis. U they are as easily confused as Jan  Barnsley suggests, perhaps they don't read  the Vancouver Sun or watch CBC's "Pacific Report" either. However, it seems to  me that they have a right to the same information as I have.  I think one of Jan's most serious mistakes  is in seeing the "Women's Movement" as  somehow separate from, and perhaps more  privileged than, women who don't identify  themselves as femimsts.  The struggle with Rape Relief is not  merely a conflict within the "Women's  Movement." Rape Relief is a service  organization—they supposedly offer crisis  line and transition house support to any  and all women who call them. They should  therefore be accountable to us all. They  have proven that they are accountable to no  one.  Many of us are well aware of the criticisms levelled against them, including:  putting women in crisis on the crisis line as  volunteers; lack of training sessions for volunteers; lack of one-to-one counselling; inadequate or non-existent referrals to doctors, lawyers, therapists, etc.; the fact that  Rape Relief charges a fee for service, and  has turned away women who are unable to  pay that fee.  As Jan would agree, these criticisms are  most serious, and of long duration. I think  it has long been our responsibility to share  the information we have with other women.  In the Sun article, Jan is quoted as saying, "Indeed it is our experience that Rape  Relief has actively discouraged women from  using the criminal justice system." We know  the criminal justice system is flawed, and  we know that the media is biased. However, while Jan criticizes Rape Relief for not  allowing women the freedom to choose to  work within that system, she wishes to silence those of us who choose to work within  the mainstream media.  In "Pacific Report," which aired on CBC  on Mon., April 24th, we received excellent  coverage on the topic of our dissatisfaction  with Rape Relief. We succeeded in clearly  exposing some of Rape Relief's flaws to  large audience. This would not have been  possible if we had limited ourselves to "in-  movement" meetings and abstract conversations.  The definition of what has to be  kept within the "Women's Movement" has  proven to be too narrow a view. I am relieved that this issue is finally "public," and  I encourage all women to continue to speak  out about Rape Relief, using whatever form  they see fit.  Lyn MacDonald  Kinesis:  I'm writing this letter to comment on the  Vancouver Sun article about Rape Relief.  It was disappointing to read a few misquotes in that article, which seemed to pit  "liberal" feminists against "radical feminists." This is not, and has never been this  issue, in the 11 or more long years of criticism of Rape Relief, by feminists in Vancouver.  I am glad, however, that the general  public—that is women and kids who may  turn to Rape Relief in crisis—have finally  been told something about the problems of  that service. Although Rape Relief very recently started a training session for counsellors, this is an exception to their rule of placing women without training, and women  still recovering from violence, on the crisis  line, or out on the streets to do fund-raising.  I know women who were put in this position, so I'm unimpressed by Rape Relief's  denials.  Many feminist and other social services in  Vancouver have stopped referring to Rape  Relief, because women clients have come to  them with complaints. These "don't refer'  policies are internal, however, and unknown  to the general public.  As a feminist, ex-Rape Relief worker  (1976-80) and a survivor of sexual assault,  I've been privy to information about Rape  Relief you may not have. I ask you to consider these questions: Why is Rape Relief the most under-utilized shelter in Vancouver? Why do a significant number of  feminist services not refer to Rape Relief?  Should women who've been battered or  raped be expected to do "political work" to  get support?  The women and kids who will really need  to know the answers to these questions are  just beginning to find out. I urge those who  have information which might protect them,  to share it with other groups, and to speak  out.  Sincerely,  Leslie Timmins  1146 Commercial * 253-0913  A1NES1S yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys  /////////////////^^^^^^  //////////////////////^^^^^  LETTERS  Nurses on  record  Kinesis:  The Health Labour Relations Association  (HLRA) has fed your readers distorted information in public statements and in advertising paid for with taxpayers' money.  Consider these facts.  • For holding peoples' lives in their hands,  our most experienced general duty nurses  earn $17.43 an hour before taxes—the  sixth lowest rate in Canada. That is our  real wage, despite the employers' inflated  figures that include a full range of benefits not all nurses can use.  HLRA brags about benefits and cites  items like employer-paid educational leave.  But that's the exception, not the rule, because it is entirely at the employers' discretion. Most nurses actually subsidize the  health care system by paying to upgrade  vital clinical knowledge and skills on their  own.  The employers say we should be grateful  to earn a little extra for working 24 hours a  day. Well, it's too little. Our night shift premium ranks seventh in Canada; and in this  province, we receive no extra pay for weekends as other B.C. workers do.  Our employers say publicly how much  they recognize the "valuable contribution"  made by B.C. nurses. But privately, in bargaining, HLRA refuses to table any wage offer whatsoever and insists that current contract provisions must be cut.  Meanwhile, U.S. and eastern Canadian  recruiters hire our nurses away in the middle of a crisis shortage. But HLRA doesn't  mention that—or a B.C. Ministry of Health  study that calls for 2,000 additional registered nurses.  This year's negotiations are make-or-  break for nursing in this province and for  the health care system that depends on us.  Either significant steps are taken to finally  value nurses' work appropriately, or the profession in B.C. will deteriorate beneath our  feet.  Despite all of HLRA's expensive propaganda, that is the reality the public must finally understand and deal with.  Yours truly,  Pat Savage, R.N.  President  British Columbia Nurses' Union  Queries  advertising  Kinesis:  I recently moved (temporarily) from  Canada to the United States. I can't tell  you how much more than ever before I appreciate Kinesis now that sources of information about and for Canadian women is  so limited. Thanks! I find myself reading every article, feature, and advertisement with  greater attention, and I have a couple of  comments to make about the April 1989 issue.  First, I am deeply troubled by the ad  for Canada's International Immunization  Program. Immunization against communicable diseases has value but should not be  uncritically accepted as a safe and effective medical procedure. Many of the vaccines in current use by the North American health-care system are unstable and  dangerous. Lethal even. Most of the vaccines have not been safety tested and effectiveness testing has been performed on animals and children much older than the two  month old (or 24 hour old!) infants who rou  tinely receive the vaccines. Before accepting, and submitting our children to, herd  immunization practices, parents need information about adverse side effects and contraindications so we may make an informed  choice about immunization. This isn't happening in Canada. It frightens me to think  about the International Program's possible  exploitations of the children of developing  countries. The government, the medical establishment, and the chemical manufacturers must be held accountable on this issue.  Second, I was very upset to see Lewis  Carroll quoted in closing an article (DAWN  B.C. focuses on family life). Carroll is  known to have been a pedophile, a sexual  offender against children. Kinesis is not a  place I would expect to see his words respected. I am disappointed.  Regards,  Wendy Chappell  Classism  Kinesis:  Open letter to the Toronto March 8  Coalition  Sisters:  We, poor women, women of colour, anti-  poverty activists and feminists, would like  to speak to the way in which poverty was  dealt with as a theme by the March 8 Coalition in organizing Toronto's International  Women's Day 1989.  In choosing poverty as its theme, the  March 8 Coalition had an opportunity to  speak to a condition that places millions of  women in Canada in situations of ill-health,  inadequate shelter and food, and extreme  mental and physical stress. Some of the disgraceful statistics—a $5,000 average annual  income for Native women or $12,000 for a  single mother with three children on Family Benefits Assistance—indicate that poor  women bear the brunt of women's oppression in this country.  Unfortunately, the Coalition did not consult with poor women and anti-poverty  groups who have been organizing around  poverty issues in Toronto for many years  as an essential first political step in beginning to mobilize for March 8. Thus, outreach was initiated too late to allow poor  women's input into the IWD poster, leaflet,  rally or fair. On the other hand, poor  women were criticized for their lack of participation in the coalition, and the question of whether poverty is even an issue for  the women's movement was debated during  coalition meetings.  Finally, the treatment of the anti-poverty  contingent which was invited to lead the  1989 march, graphically illustrated the  coalition's lack of respect for poor women.  The coalition agreed at its last meeting to  have the entire march stop at City Hall,  home of the city welfare administration,  which legislates poverty, and polices poor  women and children. Women for Economic  Justice—a coalition of poor women and  anti-poverty activists—requested and organized this peaceful action. This was further  announced at the March 4 rally at Convocation Hall.  Poor women led the march, carrying symbolic objects, among them a cheque for better social services, made out to the women  and children of Ontario, and a pink slip firing the welfare administration for endangering the health and security of Ontario  women. When we got to City Hall, however,  the march organizers did not allow the 5000  marchers to stop at City Hall. To its dismay, the anti-poverty contingent was forced  out of the march, and left to complete its  action on its own. The march did not wait  for its vanguard to return. By the time the  anti-poverty contingent returned from City  Hall, the march was long gone. The action  was made invisible, and poor women were  eliminated from the march they had been  invited to lead.  The March 8 Coalition, in its speech at  the March 4 Rally, spoke of a new women's  movement, with a leadership that would include poor and working-class women. We  have yet to see evidence of this new and  progressive leadership. We do not feel that  the March 8 Coalition said "No" to poverty  in 1989. Instead, it insulted poor women  and illustrated the coalition's political inability to develop a true class perspective in  its practice and politics. For these reasons,  we ask for a written apology by the March  8 Coalition coordinating committee to the  anti-poverty contingent.

We think it's important  to discuss our ideas and differences in a public forum, so other people can also think  about what we are saying.  With that in mind, we would like to extend an invitation to you to submit for consideration a short essay (around 850 words)  to (f.)Lip synthesizing your thoughts about  (f.)Lip and ecriture feminine.  We feel it would be good to continue this  debate in the magazine we've all been talking about.  We hope you take us up on our offer.  One other short note, in your last letter  you addressed two editors, one managing  editor and one associate editor at (f.)Lip by  "Dear Betsy Warland et al." By not naming  the magazine, except by one editor's name  and lumping the other three editors under  "et al" you are rendering the other women  involved quite invisible.  Best,  Angela Hryniuk,  Jeannie Lochrie,  Eric Hendry  Writer  clarifies  Kinesis:  Dear Karen Herland:  Thank you for clarifying your original  criticism of my Nov. '88 review of (f.)Lip  magazine. First and foremost I would like  to say it was not my intention to, as you  say, "canonize" ecriture feminine/writing in  the feminine. It would be a contradiction in  terms for me as a language-radical to uphold any style of writing as an "ideal" form,  as 'the real thing,' as a sacred cow. Writing  in the feminine as I see it is a kind of writing that is growing and changing, something  different for every writer, it is not a genre  with specific do's and don'ts. By the way,  the word canon has its roots in Catholicism  as in canonization of the 'saints;' canon of  the mass; law of the church, etc. Not a radical female word—one that I would never  use and one high on my 'girlcott' list as a  matter of fact!  I must admit, Karen, that I have taken  umbrage at your assertion that I criticize  French writing; I assume that you mean the  use of French language. I wonder if you, in  fact, read the essay on ecriture femimne by  Susan Knutson (Vol. 1 No. 4) that I singled  out as inaccessible for a non-French speaking person such as myself? I think perhaps  not or you would know that Knutson's essay is written in English but uses French  quotes to support its argument. It is becoming common practice in radical intellectual  circles to translate quotes be they Greek,  Latin or French, so that a reader not privileged with education can participate in the  dialogue.  I saw it as an anomaly for (f.)Lip which  publishes to/for an English audience to  overlook the fact that not everyone can understand French. For me, the missing translation acted as a barrier to accessing important information. It is an example of acade-  mentia at work in a supposedly rad mag. I  regard this as a matter of class when one  is using French in this way. It is not so difficult for one to translate when one clearly  has the skills to do so. As Erin Moure says  in "Poetry, Memory and the Polis" (Trivia  13): "H we're not careful, the structure of  our work reinforces heterosexism, classism,  racism, as well as sexism."  Finally, the question of accessibility. I  wrote my review from the point-of-view of  the feminist press; I did not set out to write  a literary review of (f.)Lip, and I rather  suspect that you wish I had. My audience is  one not necessarily familiar with innovative  writing. They are concerned with the question of access in a political sense. Who has  access to ecriture feminine? Women of educational privilege? Or, all kinds of women?  I believe the latter, but certainly there are  plenty of educated women from all kinds  of class backgrounds also. As a reviewer I  merely set out to report the dialogue on accessibility that has taken space on the pink  and green pages of (f.)Lip. It is still an ongoing debate.  There are no easy answers to the question of accessibility and I do not intend  to provide any answers here in this letter. But. Personally speaking as a language-  radical with working class roots and a university degree, I believe language reform to  be the basis of revolution. As we think and  speak, so we are. I ask two things then: one:  How do we bridge the gaps the "implicit  hierarchies" of class and privilege have encoded in our beings so that we are not even  aware of our own privilege? Second, and  most important: How do language-centered  writers share their work/discoveries with alt  women? In other words, how do we speak  in a common dialect of the mother-tongue?  Surely this is a question of great magnitude  that has and ought to be incorporated into  the paradigm of what writing in the feminine is all about: creating an indigenous  language of/by/for women within a diverse  global culture no less.
