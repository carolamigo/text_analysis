Time off  for women  In 1985, the International Wages for  Housework Campaign won the UN decision  that governments should include women's  unwaged work in the home, on the farm  and in their communities in the country's  Gross National Product. To pressure governments to implement this decision, Wages  for Housework coordinates a "Time Off for  Women" annually in the week of October  24th.  The theme of "Time Off '91" is Counting the Cost to Women of Military Budgets.  In the aftermath of the Gulf war, women  are expected to pick up the pieces of war-  torn lives and a shattered environment with  still more of our unwaged work. Enormous  wealth and technology have been poured  into the Gulf war; counting women's contribution to the economy is a step towards  claiming this wealth back from war and  weapons.  In this country, the International Wages  for Housework Campaign is based in Montreal, where a number of public events are  planned for the week of October 24th. For  more information about the events, for publicity materials and/or the "Women Count-  Count Women's Work" petition (available  in 25 languages) contact the campaign at  BP 5566, Succ.

The  reason for such a month would be to celebrate the achievements of Canadian women,  to foster appreciation for the contributions  of Canadian women locally, nationally and  internationally; and to" heighten the understanding of the diversity of women's lives in  this society.  The committee, which counts Kay Armstrong as an honorary patron, is suggesting that October be chosen since that is the  month the Persons Case is celebrated. The  Canadian Women's History Month Committee (CWHM) is asking supportive individuals and groups to send a letter to Mary  Collins, Minister Responsible for the Status  of Women calling for one month a year to be  declared our history month. Write to Mary  Collins at: 151 Sparks St., Ottawa, ONT  KlA 1C3. The CWHM would also like to  receive a copy of your letters, as well as any  comments or suggestions you may have con-  cerning this idea. CWHM: 893 Leslie Drive,  Victoria, BC V8X 2Y3.  Guide to women's  movement collections  The Canadian Women's Movement Archives/Archives canadiennes du mouvement  des femmes is compiling a guide to the  records of the contemporary Canadian  women's movement. This bilingual guide,  to be published in 1992, will help scholars and activists locate records (i.e., minutes, reports, correspondence, photographs,  posters, etc.) of the many women's groups  which have existed in Canada since 1960.  This summer we sent questionnaires to  about 2,500 organizations whose records  we hope to list in the guide. We included  women's organizations, groups which focus on a women's issue, and feminist committees within larger organizations such as  unions and ethno cultural organizations.  We would be glad to hear from any organization we may have missed. We are  also eager to hear from any individual who  has the records of a women's group. (Often when a group disbands, a member will  preserve its records.) We would also welcome questions or suggestions related to the  project.

While the effectiveness of the rape shield  law is open to question, the highest court's  dismissal of one of the country's few  feminist-inspired laws is an undeniable blow  to women's rights.  The court threw out Section 276, which  protected rape victims from being cross-  examined about their sexual history during a trial. In their 7-2 decision, the judges  ruled that Section 276 went too far by disallowing potentially relevant evidence and  thereby jeopardizing the accused's right to  a fair trial. The constitutionality of the rape  shield had been challenged by two accused  rapists, who argued their rights under the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated (see Kinesis May 1991).  The majority decision, written by Madam  Justice Beverly McLachlin, also advises parliament to devise new guidelines to permit  an accused rapist's lawyer to introduce evidence about the women's sexual past, at the  discretion of the trial judge.  While the judges acknowledged that defense lawyers should not be permitted to indiscriminately question a woman about her  sexual past, their offer of "judicial discretion" seems feeble, at best.  Two dissenting judges, Madame Justice  Claire  L'Heureux-Dube and  Justice  The purpose of the rape shield provisions, introduced with major changes to the  Criminal Code in 1983, was to encourage  women to report rape by reducing their  well-founded fear of being "raped" again in  the court room by lawyers prying into their  personal lives. Feminists had argued force-  ...even with the rape shield law, rape continued  to be the most common, least reported and  least punished violent crime in the country.  Charles Gonthier, objected whole-heartedly  to the majority decision. In her dissent,  L'Heureux-Dube painted a scathing portrait of rape justice in Canada, acknowledging the sexism and stereotypes at the root  of women's experience, and the absolute in-  appropriateness of "discretionary decisionmaking" by judges in rape cases.  The courts upheld the constitutionality  of a sister provision, Section 277, which prohibits cross-examination about a woman's  sexual history with the aim of discrediting  her credibility.  fully for such protection; the 1983 laws on  sexual assault bore the imprint of over a  decade of women's lobbying.  In August, women reacted to the Supreme Court ruling with disbelief and  fury—and a measure of seasoned realism.  Among other things, femimst groups observed that:  • even with the rape shield law in place,  rape continued to be the most common,  least reported and least punished violent  crime in the country;  • men who rape already understand they  can beat the system; this ruling will encourage them, just as women (who already understand the system beats them) will be discouraged;  • evidence about a woman's sexual past  will most certainly be used to discredit her  in the eyes of a jury. On a profound level,  women understand that the fundamental  myth about rape (that "she asked for it" or  "deserved it") still flourishes among men;  • asking judges to 'exercise discretion' as  to whether a women's sexual past is relevant flies in the face of considerable—and  mounting—evidence of the judiciary's gross  insensitivity to women's issues in general,  and sexual assault in particular. In the past  18 months, at least three male judges have  been caught in the public spotlight making  sexist rulings in sexual assault cases;  (Indeed, pointing a finger at sexism in the  legal system (also known as "gender bias")  has almost become flavour of the year, with  a study underway in BC, and a major report issued earlier this year by the Manitoba Association of Women and the Law.)  • ironically, the ruling comes less than  a week after the federal government appointed a $10 million panel to examine vi-  See RAPE SHIELD page 4  In Nova Scotia:  Pandora boxed  by complaint  by Agnes Huang  Halifax's feminist newspaper, Pandora,  has been hounded by a complaint of sexual discrimination by a man for over a year.  The complaint, which challenges Pandora's  editorial policy of publishing women only,  threatens to cost the volunteer-run paper  up to $10,000 in legal fees. It also raises serious concerns about the role of human right's  bodies and whether or not they protect disadvantaged groups— like women.  Later this fall, Pandora's case will be  heard and ruled on by a board of inquiry of  the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission  (NSHRC).  The events surrounding the case started  in June 1990 when a man lodged a formal  complaint with the NSHRC. He was angry  that the collective would not publish a letter  he intended to write in response to a Pandora article on "fathers' rights" in custody  battles.  (Neither Pandora nor the NSHRC  would identify the man to Kinesis, since  the case is under inquiry. The man is known  to be a fathers' rights proponent.)  His complaint to the NSHRC followed an  hour-long conversation with a Pandora editorial board member, during which he was  informed the paper was produced by, for  and about women and it was unlikely his  letter would be printed.  He also contacted Pandora's advertisers—the paper's only source of revenue  outside subscriptions—-pressuring them to  suspend their contracts with Pandora.  This move backfired when Pandora's advertisers continued their support.  It wasn't until several months after filing  a formal complaint with the NSHRC that  the man actually sent Pandora the letter  he wanted published.  As it does with all complaints, the  NSHRC started an investigation. Pandora  was asked to discuss the matter at the  NSHRC's office, where they explained their  two-fold position: that Pandora "informs  and provides a voice for women by supporting a woman-only policy" and that the paper assists "women in obtaining skills in  writing and producing a newspaper."  Pandora beheved the complaint would  be dropped by the NSHRC because it  lacked sufficient content. To their shock, the  NSHRC instead called for conciliation meetings between Pandora and the man. These  meetings were unsuccessful and by April  1991 the case was back in NSHRC hands.  In August, the minister responsible for  the Human Rights Commission, Attorney General Joe Mackisson, approved the  NSHRC's recommendation to send the complaint to a full board of inquiry.  The behaviour of the NSHRC in this  case is cause for great concern. In recent  years, a mere 4—5 percent of complaints  in Nova Scotia are referred to the inquiry  stage (compared to 10 percent in BC, for example). The rest are either dismissed early  on in the investigation process or resolved  through conciliation.  NSHRC spokespersons would not explain, either in general or specific terms,  why the complaint against Pandora was  sent to a board of inquiry, saying the information was confidential.  Pandora discussed another option recommended by the NSHRC—to apply for an  exemption as an equality-promoting group  (i.e. to be able to "legitimately" discriminate in favour of women for the purpose of  promoting women's equality).  The collective concluded such an approach was politically undesirable. As editorial board member Amani Wassef wrote  in a recent issue: "If Pandora sought an exemption, it would leave every other women's  organization in a position of vulnerability  ... it would set a precedent requiring a  similar exemption every time a woman-only  event, publication, meeting ... anything,  was scheduled."  As well, the collective says Pandora is  already promoting sex equality and doesn't  need permission from the NSHRC to continue their work.  The exemption clause for equality-promoting groups is stated in Nova Scotia's Human Rights Act. Brigil Pachai, executive director of the NSHRC says that: "It is necessary for equality- promoting groups to seek  exemption to protect themselves."  The target of the man's complaint  is Pandora's editorial policy stated in  the masthead of the paper. Their policy,  Hke that of other feminist newspaper in  Canada, is woman-positive. Pandora "actively seek(s) participation on any level  from women who do not have access to  mainstream media."  Pandora refuses to be compromised.  Says Wassef "To give up our woman-only  pohcy, even if it was only to allow 'one small  letter' from a man, would be counter to the  purposes of our existence."  While other feminist newspapers in  Canada have varying pohcies on publishing  men, there is widespread support for Pandora 's right to dictate its own editorial policy.  "We publish women's stories written by  women to validate women's experiences,"  says Annette Ruitenbeek of Perspectives]  in Calgary. "Women's publications have  been set up because the media is dominated  by men's viewpoints and we need women's  viewpoints."  Says Caffyn Kelley, publisher of Women  Artists' Monographs: "Men take up 75—I "  percent of the talking time in the world. It's  really important to have women-only spaces  where we can make up and sustain our own  cultures and languages."  The Womanist publisher Joan Riggs  warns: "[if Pandora loses], the implications  for women's papers are great. Our papers  will be in jeopardy ... [Will] human rights  commissions have editorial control over feminist newspapers?"  Whatever the outcome of the board of inquiry, this will have been a costly episode for  Pandora. H their editorial pohcy is ruled to  be discriminatory, Pandora can be made to  abide by terms set by the board, which may  include changing the pohcy.  Even if the inquiry goes in Pandora's  favour, the paper will not receive any compensation from the NSHRC or the man filing the complaint. (The man, meanwhile,  faces no costs. The NSHRC's resources and  legal counsel are used to investigate his complaint.)  Many women are comparing this case  to the WenDo incident in Ontario. There,  the Ontario Human Rights Commission  ruled against the man who had complained  against WenDo because he was not allowed  to join their women's self-defense classes.  The complaint was judged to be vexatious.  Pandora hopes the NSHRC will take a  similar stand.  To raise the $ 10,000 in legal fees  needed to fight their case (their lawyer  is Ann Derrick), Pandora has established a fundraising committee. They  urgently need financial support.

I  KINESIS  Sept. 91 ss*ss**^***^sss*s^^  NEWS  Medicare under attack:  Our sickening health care  by Noreen Shanahan  The cry has been sounded: now is the  time for all good women (and men) to come  to the aid of medicare—before the final slice  by the federal Conservatives leaves the program nothing more than a relic of Canadian  health care history.  Such was the message given by a panel  of activists and pohticians at a recent Vancouver forum sponsored by the BC Health  Care Advocates.  (The BC Health Care Advocates, a coahtion of labour and community groups,  formed in 1990 during the Royal Commission on Health Care and continues today to  publicize threats to medicare.)  "Medicare is dying a slow death," said  National Action Committee on the Status  of Women (NAC) president Judy Rebick, a  participant at the forum. "Life is seeping  out of [the program] and no one is noticing.  We cannot let it go."  From medicare's inception in the 1960's  until 1977, the federal government and  provinces shared health care costs on a fifty-  fifty basis. The Established Financing Act  was then established which fixed health care  transfer payments to the Gross National  Product.  However, by 1986, the federal govern  ment had lowered it's share to two percent  below the county's economic growth. Furthermore, funds are now frozen until 1995.  "With these cuts the government is sabotaging the system they once referred to as  a 'sacred trust'," said Kathleen Connor of  the Ottawa-based Canadian Health Coalition. "They have proven that they cannot  be trusted to protect the health of average  Canadians."  Ottawa now funds only thirty percent of  the original fifty-fifty split, and by 1994/5  they will have withheld a staggering $32 billion from provincial health care budgets.  As federal money is removed from the  health care system, services will deteriorate. Wealthy Canadians will turn more and  more to private health care as the publicly-  funded system falters—a circle that will  quickly become vicious. "The result will be  a Canada with ten very different and separate health systems, where health is purchased by those who can afford it," says the  Coalition. "Canada could become a country  where you cannot afford to get sick, where  they check your purse before they check  your pulse."  Health care activists say plans are to wipe  out universality and devolve responsibility  for all health and social services onto the  provinces.  Further, federal protections presently  imbedded under the Canada Health Act  (such as no user fees or extra-billing), will  be lost as the system becomes privatized.  Indeed, the drive to privatize government  services—whether it be airports, hospitals  or schools—is a core goal of free enterprise  parties hke the Tories.  "The Tories beheve we should only have  services if we can afford them," said Rebick.  "We have to counter this argument and say  we reject the idea that economic competitiveness is the way to go. We say that caring for people is."  The majority of consumers as well as  workers in the health care system are  women, said Rebick. She then expressed  frustration at the situation where instead of  putting energy into reforming a health care  system that never really met our needs, activists are forced to struggle to hold onto  the existing system.  She sees there being two parts to the current fight: supporting medicare and developing alternative strategies for health care.  "We want reforms, not cutbacks. We  want increased interest in women's health,  preventative strategies, less invasive procedures, community-controlled health care."  Canadians hke medicare. Recent research  has shown that eighty- five percent of the  population want it to continue as a part of  the fabric of Canadian hfe.  Medicare is also a constitutional issue—  and, in British Columbia, an election issue.  Recent Social Credit proposals suggest a  killing approach to medicare. According  a 1990 paper by then Finance Minister Mel  Couveher (endorsed recently by Socred <  stitutional advisor Mel Smith): "The federal  government has, through the imposition of  national program standards, continued to  interfere with provincial efforts to control  program costs."  This statement, says Carmela Allevato of  the Hospital Employees Union, by implication criticizes the Canada Health Act for  blocking the BC government from imposing  user fees, which she says represents the leading edge of the Socred attack on medicare.  "Premier Johnston has advocated user  fees for medical services on at least two occasions ...," Allevato says. "Furthermore,  user fees don't lower health costs. Only low-  income people were discouraged from using  medical services and wealthier people actually increased their use of the health care  system."  , Community and labour groups are joining with the BC Health Care Advocates in  an ongoing campaign to dog the heels of  candidates in the upcoming election.  RAPE SHIELD from page 3  olence against Canadian women (see page  • if laws such as the rape shield can be  ruled "unconstitutional," women should be  using upcoming constitutional negotiations  to fight for some real Charter protection.  In the week after the ruhng, rape crisis  workers fielded calls from hundreds of worried and angry women.  Johanna Pilot, spokeswoman for Vancouver's WAVAW/Rape Crisis Centre, predicts  that an outcome of the riiling will be even  fewer rapes reported.  The reporting couldn't get much lower.  While recent figures on Canadian Justice  note a marked increase in rape reporting  since 1975, the accepted statistic is 10 percent.  Of those 10 percent, a very small percentage (less than a quarter) will go to trial.  Only 10 percent of those trials will result in  convictions.  Pilot says that, even with the rape shield,  women were justifiably wary about their  treatment in the court system.  'The rape shield provision wasn't much  protection," says Pilot. "There's an assumption that we're in a post-feminist era, that  everything has changed. That's wrong.  "A woman's sexual past is still brought  up in court. The defense lawyer brings it up:  questions get asked about whether she has  a boyfriend, whether she has kids, or about  her conversations with the rapist about  other men." Such questions, says Pilot are  asked to reveal sexual information in order  to influence a jury.  Lawyer Megan Elhs agrees. "Defense  lawyers have ways of asking questions and  making statements [about the woman] that  aren't in a head-on colhsion with the rape  shield provisions. And the Crown prosecutor wouldn't necessarily object to that hne  of  vene because that could suggest the woman  had something to hide. A protection [such  as the rape shield] is only good if the Crown  is prepared to assert it."  The fact that Crown prosecutors haven't  necessarily protected women from inappropriate questioning underscores the fact that,  in a rape trial, the woman is merely a witness: the prosecutor is not "her" lawyer,  but the state's. If parliament does enact a  watered-down law to replace Section 276 (as  the court advises), women may be the last  to know it's for their benefit.  The ruhng also sheds a disappointing  hght on the role of the Charter. "The Charter has predominantly been used by interest groups who are not disadvantaged," says  Anita Braha, of the National Association of  Women and the Law (NAWL). Braha points  to a study that shows that between 1985-  1988, of the 600 challenges under the Charter's equahty section, only 9 were brought  by equality-seeking groups. The rape shield  law was challenged under Charter sections  relating to "security of person," but, as  Braha says: "We are seeing here the same  pattern of serving the advantaged."  While Braha acknowledges a need for  long-term strategies such as educating the  pohce and judges, she expressed immense  frustration at the court's ruhng. "It's hard  to be patient. When the highest level of the  judiciary come out with such a ruhng, it's  demoralizing."  One possible strategy, she says, would  be to call for an immediate amendment to  the Criminal Code to reinstate the rape  shield protection—even if such a law may be  challenged again. And, says Braha, women  should be taking their anger to the streets.  Taking it to the constitutional table is another possibihty. The Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), which  had argued for the preservation of the rape  shield law, is now considering a range of  strategies, including whether or not to seek  stronger equahty rights under the Charter,  or to demand that the government use the  Charter's override provision to reinstate the  rape shield despite its unconstitutionality.  As weU, LEAF and other groups will  probably pressure the newly appointed  Panel on Violence to demand new protections.  In the meantime, rape crisis workers hke  Johanna Pilot will be monitoring courtrooms to see how the loss of the rape  shield affects women's treatment. "At this  time, we neither encourage nor discourage  women from using the court system," says  Pilot. "We provide them with information  on court procedures and on what they can  expect to happen, so they can make an informed choice.  "And women often ask, 'how awful will it  be?' "  For some women, the courtroom will be  hke another rape.

New panel to study old violence  by Lee Lakeman  What's a radical to do?  For the next 15 months, grassroots activists will contend with the new Canadian  Panel to Address Violence Against Women  appointed in mid-August by the federal  Conservatives.  Ten individuals, headed by Pat Marshall  (Ontario) and Marthe Asselin Vaillancourt  (Quebec) have been equipped with $10 million and an assignment from the Minister  Responsible for the Status of Women, Mary  Collins, to "facilitate a national dialogue  for action on violence against women," and  working "at arm's length from the government" to prepare a "federal work plan" for  consideration by the Conservatives just before the next election.  Already this year, the Tories have  had two opportunities to hear directly  from activists on violence issues. In June  1991, national women's groups caucused  at Kim Campbell's National Symposium  on Women, Law and the Administration  of Justice at Vancouver's Pan Pacific Hotel (see Kinesis, July/August 1991). Feminist unity has never been higher between  groups and our demands re: violence against  women were specific and fairly comprehensive.  Many of the same women's groups had  delivered briefs in February to the parliamentary Standing Committee on the  Health and Welfare, the body which eventually issued the controversial The War  Against Women report. The committee  asked women's groups their opinion about  a royal commission on violence against  women. When asked, groups were clear that  they didn't want redundant research controlled by the government, or a mass media  campaign about frightened women.  Led by the women's critics of all  three major pohtical parties, the standing committee recommended some feminist initiatives in their The War Against  Women report. But as state officials will,  they contradicted our significant points on  the need for the panehsts to be delegates of women's groups, the damage of  government-controlled research, and the rejection of government "coordination" of  grass-roots feminist services.  The Tories also found the contents and title of the report too confrontational. A majority on the committee, they blocked endorsement of the report and refused to approve a royal commission as promised in the  Throne Speech last spring.  By August 15, the proposals made by  feminists had been subdued into the "blue  ribbon " Panel we have today.  Since it was obvious in February that  some version of a royal commission was on  the government's agenda, women's groups  at the hearing had outlined conditions under which we might find one potentially useful. We should now use these as guidelines  for responding to the Panel:  • The Panel should not impede or preclude other strategies.  We must refuse to be diverted from our  basic work of organizing women in our own  defense and honing the rage of women. It  our work, community-by-community, that  forced this huge state apparatus to respond.  No Panel is more important than our own  grass-roots rescuing, public education and  organising.  • The Panel should not divert funds from  existing programs and services which are already under-funded.  Diverting funds is easy for a government  that rarely funds activist women's groups.  The Panel has a lot of money and we  can protest that, in the meantime, some  is to study the federal state and its institutionalized sexism and to expose that to us,  so that by the next election the government  will be forced to introduce some reforms.  • The Panel should be composed of repre-  We should refuse to waste our  time counting things that have  already been counted.  women's groups will do without. But we  must also see that we get some value for  that money.  • Women's groups, including front hne  workers, must be included in the planning  and implementation stages.  Contact the Panel immediately. It's not  a collective and only the two co-chairs are  full-time. Call Pat Marshall at METRAC  in Toronto (Tel.: (416) 393-3135). The National Action Committee on the Status of  Women (NAC) has already insisted on a  formal relationship between the Panel and  a body of national women's groups. Also  insist that the demands advanced by feminists at the previous conferences be acknowledged and used by the Panel members. Ask for their plans and give your opinions. Do it in strength through provincial  and national groups.  • The Panel should not engage in exten-,  sive research to document incidents of violence against us.  We should refuse to waste our time counting things that have already been counted  or that reveal more about women than  about the men who do the attacking. Acknowledge that the statistics commonly  used have already been generated by rape  crisis centres and transition houses and published by various arms of the government.  • Travel funds should be made available  to front hne women's groups to coordinate  our knowledge and expertise.  To this end, support the funding demands of the Canadian Association of Sexual Assault Centres and of the emerging National Association of Transition Houses and  of NAC and other national feminist groups.  We have been trying to force the federal government to fund the annual crosscountry meetings of these front hne activists  so that analysis and pan-Canadian campaigns are more possible without any middle men. Those conferences must not be  subsumed by the work of the Panel.  • The Panel should be action oriented.  We have a right to expect the Panel  to disturb the federal bureaucracy immediately. We need immediate draft legislation  to replace the rape shield law struck down  by the Supreme Court on August 22nd. We  must know what the Panel is doing and  which part of the state is blocking reforms.  These fights must be waged during the coming months. ''  • One outcome of the Panel should be  a national work plan that recommends permanent ways of eradicating violence against  women. For instance, reforms in law, and  pohcy regarding health education, criminal  justice and social support services.  Don't feed the Panel information about  ourselves and our organizations. Their job  sentatives/delegates of women's groups—  but it isn't.  Each of the members is on her and his  own.

However, the government announced  them as members of groups and as tokens of  certain groups of women. We insist on their  accountability and we'll support them only  to the extent that they exercise that responsibility. But how the hell can Mobina Jaffer  be expected to represent both BC's interests and the interests of immigrant women  and participate fully in this half-time position?  The government has succeeded in avoiding the pohtical strength of a united national women's movement on this Panel.  But 15 months is a long time and we can  raise a lot of hell.

KINESIS     sa"~        ~ sssssssssas^^  NEWS  WHAT1 S NEWS?  by Donna Butorac  Poverty's ugly  long-term effects  Poverty and widespread bottle feeding  are creating conditions that leave many  Canadian children at risk of suffering from  developmental problems due to an iron-poor  diet in infancy.  The poor diet can lead to a condition known as iron-deficiency anemia, which  causes permanent slow intellectual and  physical development. Children of poor  families are considered most at risk.  A study conducted in Montre'al last year  by Dr. Katherine Gray-Donald of McGiU  University, showed that a quarter of children from poor families had iron-deficiency  anemia. Of the babies tested, 24 percent  were being given cow's milk by the age of  four months. Only 14 percent of the babies were breast fed. Cow's milk lacks iron  that a baby can absorb and causes intestinal bleeding, which can aggravate anemia.  However, to mothers on low income, cow's  milk is much more affordable than costly enriched infant formula.  The hnk between iron-deficiency anemia  and poverty cannot be overlooked, say the  researchers.  "We really have to gear our research and  intervention to the pockets of the popula:  tion. If we don't do that we are really closing our eyes to the problem," said Suzanne  Hendricks, President of the National Institute of Nutrition.  At last count, in 1986, one million Canadian children—one in six—hved below the  poverty hne. That number is certain to have  grown during the current recession.  According to Health and Welfare Canada,  poor women are less hkely to breast feed  their babies. Some people beheve this is due  to the fact that for decades breast feeding  was associated with low incomes, and some  women are reluctant to breast feed for fear  of being stigmatized. Some Canadian doctors suggest that a stop-gap solution to the  WOMEN WORKING  TOGETHER  Library       • Lounge  Resource Office  Outreach Programs  AQ 2003, Simon Fraser University,  Burnaby, V5A1S6 291-3670  rising incidence of iron-deficiency anemia  among poor children is to subsidize iron-  enriched infant formula, so that it is accessible to mothers on low incomes.  A similar program in the US has helped  to lower the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia to less than 3 percent, from double digit  figures in some areas in the late 1960's.  Breast feeding advocates, on the other  hand, say that instead of subsidizing infant  formula, the government should concentrate  on education and the promotion of breastfeeding. Exclusive breast feeding is a baby's  best protection against iron deficiency for  at least six months, and with the introduction of iron-rich foods at this age, there is  virtually no need for formulas. Breast feeding helps protect babies against iron deficiency, ear infection, meningitis, respiratory infections and gut infections, and helps  the mother against breast cancer, ovarian  cancer and osteoporosis. Advocates further  point out that infant formulas contain high  levels of aluminum, lead and manganese.  Source: The Globe and Mail.  Gun control: now's  the time to act  The federal government's proposed new  gun-control legislation, introduced in May,  has been heavily criticized for catering too  much to the powerful gun owners lobby. According to the Coalition for Gun Control,  while Bill C-17 does improve some existing laws, it nevertheless favours gun owners  over public safety.  One of the bill's biggest flaws is seen  to be its failure to ban all semi-automatic  weapons, such as the one used in the  Montreal massacre. The bill also does not  require people applying for a Firearms  Acquisition Certificate (FAC) to undergo  training in the use of firearms, nor will they  be required to waive confidentiahty of their  psychiatric records.  While Bill C-17 does require a 28-day period for the processing of FAC applications,  as well as allowing for judges to consider  1988 W 4th & Maple  Vancouver, B.C.

The Coalition is also demanding that C-  17 be amended so:  • That the age for obtaining a Firearm  Acquisition Certificate (FAC) be raised  from 16 to 18, except for minors' permits in  special cases;  • That assault weapons and automatics converted to semi-automatics be banned  with no exceptions for guns already in circulation;  • That in addition to the measures in the  proposed legislation, community checks be  mandatory prior to issuing a FAC;  • That all weapons be registered by type  and serial number, and that this information be coordinated nationwide;  • That the FAC or equivalent be required  to purchase ammunition and that the sale  of ammunition be strictly controlled.  Every year 1,400 Canadians die of gunshot wounds. Guns are particularly lethal  in domestic violence: in 1989 46 percent of  women murdered by their husbands were  shot. The 1989 Montreal massacre of 14  women at FEcole Polytechnique is seen by  the Coalition for Gun Control as evidence  that guns are available which serve no legitimate hunting or target shooting purpose.  The Coalition was formed to redress what  it sees as an imbalance in the power of  the gun owners' lobby. Among its supporters are the National Action Committee on  the Status of Women (NAC) and the National Association of Women and the Law  (NAWL).

Diane Driedger and April D'Aubin who  work with the Canadian self-help group,  Coalition of Provincial Organizations  of the Handicapped (COPOH) talked  with her about women with disabilities  in El Salvador.  I started to work in the disabled persons'  self-help movement in El Salvador in 1979.  At that time it was unacceptable to talk  about disabled women's issues.  There are cultural attitudes that see a  disabled person as sick. There is also the  There are laws  saying if you cannot  have sexual  intercourse you  cannot get married  attitude that a woman doesn't need to go  to school and the disabled woman does not  need to attend school as she will be taken  care of by the family.  Disabled women still have a problem with  self-esteem—you can see that in the way  they talk and act. They don't develop self-  esteem because of society's view that the  beautiful woman is a perfect woman.  I remember when my family went to  the beach for Easter holidays. When I was  young, I did not see the difference between  my body and others. But when I became a  teenager, I did not hke my body. When I noticed that I did not want to go to the beach.  I was very ashamed. I stayed with my grandmother instead. It took a long time for me  to enjoy myself inside my body.  What you feel inside is the impression  that you give to people. I used to swim a  lot in a pubhc pool and there I would see  a lot of non-disabled people who were very  fat or sirinny. This also helped me see that  ah people were not "perfect."  When I was a very young woman, I would  burst into tears if anyone mentioned my  disabihty. Whenever I talked about relationships with men my voice would tremble. I thought that it was not normal—  relationships between disabled women and  men.  Women are taught to keep their sexual  feehngs to themselves. I never heard my  sisters talk about their sexual experiences.  When a woman is not married, married  women do not share experiences with them.  Men get together and talk about their sexual experiences. For women it's taboo still.  Now, I have hved with a man for six  years. At the beginning I felt guilty, because  my parents did not approve of my relation-  ' ip. He was younger and didn't belong to  the same social strata. It's; also not common for people to hve together without being married in El Salvador. But, now I don't  feel guilty, I'm just doing what I want to do.  Sterilization and Abuse  Forced sterilization is a problem. I know an  institution housing many people with cerebral palsy and they recommend that the  women be sterilized. They are doing this because there is much abuse of these women,  not only from strangers, but from their own  family members. On the other hand, they  recommend sterilization because many people tend to see a disabled woman as more  ; to have sex than other women.  discrimination. We need to do a lot with  deaf women, as well as bhnd women.  I think deaf persons are one of the largest  disabihty groups in El Salvador. This is because of lack of attention to pregnant mothers. They either get measles or the child  contracts meningitis after birth. There is  ■■HHH -*>'  I heard of one woman with cerebral palsy  who was in an institution and was raped by  her cousin. When her mother found out she  made her abort. Her mother was so angry  that she physicaUy abused her.  She was blamed for the rape. In most  cases the disabled women are blamed for being raped. It is said that they have a desperate need to have sex.  Parents are very afraid of having their  disabled children raped, and this leads them  toward sterilization.  Who can say who can have children and  who cannot?  Organizing for Change  In 1979, disabled people started to organize  a self-help group. Then after a few years we  formed a co-operative (ACOGIPRI), which  is where I now work as an administrator. We  have established a ceramics factory, making  teapots, cups, decorations.  In 1987, I started a program for women  with disabihties. It brought women together  to exchange experiences. With the program  they feel free to come and talk about any  issue—things they would never discuss with  their families or their friends.  I always had in mind how I never had  anyone to talk to about someone I hked.  I was very curious about sexuahty but I  never had anyone to ask. I was very satisfied and happy that, with this group of disabled women I can say I am afraid of this  and that and different things.  We meet once a week. The group ranges  from 15 to 30 women. We have transportation problems, so sometimes there are a lot  and other times there are just a few.  We have a problem attracting deaf  women to the group. Interpretation is a  problem, as there is no real sign language in  El Salvador. I use some gestures and American Sign Language. Deaf women face much  also mistreatment. I know many people who  have become deaf due to abuse.  Usually it is very difficult for deaf women  to get employment. Employers won't hire  them, because they are afraid of communication problems.  Legalized Discrimination  There are laws permitting discrimination.  Since last year, there has been a study group  with my organization and other disabihty  groups on discrimination in the law.  For instance, laws on the family usually  group together deaf and mentally disabled  women. One statute denies deaf and mentally handicapped women the right to keep  their children.  There are laws that say that if you cannot have sexual intercourse you cannot get  married. What about two people who are  quadriplegic? Just think about that. What  about people who cannot physically have in-,  tercourse?  The law on jury duty was changed a year  ago. It used to exclude bhnd and deaf people from serving on juries. Then they ex  tended it to people who cannot write because of their disabihty.  We were shocked because this was clearly  discrimination. So we went to the highest authority to ask them why. The press  was there. The authorities said this had  been law since 1856. I said, "Have you noticed that a man has walked on the moon?  So then another disabled woman who was  with me said, "Why don't you discriminate  against people who are susceptible to pohtical corruption?" They didn't have an answer for that.  There are non-governmental organizations dealing with women's issues. They  never mention women with disabihties. It  is hke we don't exist. There are a lot of  things for women in the rural areas, single  mothers, for women in the very poor areas,  training programs. Whenever I asked about  these things for disabled women they go,  "Oh? ..."  Literacy Seminar  C5 Our women's program sponsored a Uteres acy  seminar  in  February  1991.  We re-  " ceived funding through the Coalition of  <8 Provincial  Organizations   of  the   Handi-  § capped (COPOH) in Canada who received  o a grant from the Canadian International  J| Development Agency. These funds helped  °" bring together disabled women from seven  Central American countries. Two Canadians, Susan Dueck and Gary Schofield, attended the seminar as consultants.  The most important thing was that  we had women from different countries.  Meeting women with disabihties and sharing common concerns was the first step  to enhancing their self-esteem. Self-esteem  is needed for personal empowerment. In  their post-seminar evaluation, they suggested that we should conduct more seminars.  A lot of women wanted to come but they  couldn't read. We couldn't have illiterate  women attend, because the seminar was on  functional hteracy. The goal was to enable  women to write their stories and have them  published in the media.  After the seminar, some of the articles  that the women wrote were published in  their local newspapers. Now, in El Salvador,  whenever there is an article written on an  issue of disabihty we meet to discuss it and  criticize it.  We need to see if the article benefits disabled people—usually not. We need to write  our own stories to ensure they are told properly. The idea is to train 25 disabled women  to be trainers for the small groups of disabled women in Guatemala, Nicaragua and  El Salvador. We want them to write articles, organize small newsletters and to do  public speaking. This is what our next hteracy project will do.  ACOGIPRI is the only organization focusing on disabled women. We have started  to be in touch with other groups of women  and they are very interested in knowing  about us. Initially other groups of women  were very surprised to learn that disabled  women were getting together and organizing. We have a lot in common and they  know that the situation for disabled women  is much worse. They support us by buying  ceramics from our disabled persons' cooperative and by inviting us to attend women's  meetings and events.  It is too soon to say that women's groups  understand the issues of accessibihty for disabled women, but they have overall been  very receptive and understanding of our issues.  KINESIS News  Pulp fiction:  Bright white = filthy dirty  by Lynne Jamieson  Every day in British Columbia, thousands of trees are felled and thousands of  tonnes of persistent organochlorines, including dioxins and furans, find their home in  our waterways. The local consumer may feel  unable to effect changes given the fact that  most of this pollution is the byproduct of an  industry that feeds the needs of consumers  in the United States, Japan and Europe.  However, the tissue products sector is susceptible to local consumer demand and this  is where we can make a difference.  Soft tissue products—hke toilet paper  and paper towels—are the only sector of  the pulp and paper industry that are manufactured locally and distributed solely to  Canadian consumers. The industry repeatedly tells us that they respond to signals  from the market and so the time has come  to send them two clear messages:  • clearcutting of first growth forest to manufacture disposable tissue products is unacceptable;  • we no longer want chlorine bleached tissue products.  As women, we have historically been the  prime target of 'tissue industry advertising. We have been encouraged to buy a  wide range of disposable paper products—  including tableware, menstrual products,  toilet paper, facial tissues, kitchen towels  and diapers. We have been told that these  products will make our hves cleaner, healthier and more convenient.  In 1990, England's Women's Environment Network (WEN) published a book  called A Tissue of Lies in which they  asked the question: "did the disposable paper industry grow out of our real needs—or  have we grown to need an array of silly and  wasteful products, as victims of sustained  media manipulation?"  It is also time to question the validity  of these advertising claims in view of the  devastating environmental effects implicit  in their use. The language of paper product marketers and advertisers associates  "whiteness and brightness" with "cleanliness and purity." This language is not only  racist in its equation of white with pure, but  it masks a different reality: paper products  bleached with chlorine-containing chemicals are contaminated with organochlorines,  and effluent from pulp mills is a brown  toxic sludge. Other aspects of the reality of  bleaching with chlorinated compounds include contaminated fish, widespread fisheries closures, workers subjected to chlorine  or chlorine dioxide gassing inside pulp mills,  and higher than average rates of cancer in  communities near pulp mills.  This is not clean, nor is it pure. While  the product may appear to be clean, bright  and sanitary, the common pulp production  process (based on chlorinated compounds)  is not.  Clearly, these words need to be redefined to incorporate the cleanliness of the  entire production process. We need to ask  whether these products are "clean" within  the context of clean production and clean  In addition to an unclean production process women especially have concerns for  the inherent health risks of paper products that may be contaminated with residual organochlorines. Bright white sanitary  pads or tampons may be relatively easy to  use—but what are the health risks?  Finally, the environmental discussion of  disposable paper products is not complete  without mention of broader social and po  htical issues for women. The convenience  of many disposal products relative to their  reusable, more labour-intensive alternatives  has meant that women have experienced  some freedom from "domestic" responsibilities (notably laundry). A movement back  to more ecologically sound products may  translate to an increased burden on women  in the home unless basic equahty issues-  like men doing their share of household  tasks—are also addressed.  Dirty Process, Dirty Product  Historically, production systems have developed with httle consideration for environmental and human consequences. As a  result, consumers are presented with httle  choice but to purchase products that are  hazardous in their production, use or disposal. Alternatively, "clean production" is  defined as production systems which avoid  or eliminate hazardous waste and hazardous  has been keeping a close watch on the European marketplace where dramatic changes  in consumer awareness and preferences have  occurred in recent years. The screening of a  controversial film on German television depicting the devastation of Canadian forests  to supply European demand for paper products has caused forest companies' executives  to fear a potential boycott of Canadian for-  .est products.  In fact, forest companies are beginning  to lose contracts with European buyers who  do not want a product that is the result  of bad forest management practices or has  been bleached with chlorine-based bleaching agents. In June of this year, Fletcher  Challenge Canada lost 7 to 10 thousand  tonnes of pulp sales due to concerns about  environmental or consumer acceptabihty of  bleaching with chlorinated compounds.

Goods produced in clean production systems are compatible with biological  processes and ecosystems throughout their  entire product hfe cycle: from the extraction  of raw materials, through the manufacturing process, to their use and ultimate disposal.  The pulp and paper industry is a clearcut  example of a production process that does  not meet the criteria of clean production.  Ecologically unsustainable forestry practices (including clearcut logging, the destruction of old growth forests, and loss of  species biodiversity), all for the sake of paper and tissue products that are used once  before meeting their fate in a landfill, are  not clean. Pulp production processes that  continue to rely on chlorine-based bleach- .  ing agents, when alternatives exist, are not  clean. Finally, the idea of a disposable product, with its associated environmental costs,  used in place of a reuseable one, is not clean.  The Canadian pulp and paper industry  whatever will happen," said Tom WiUiams  of Fletcher Challenge's pubhc affairs department. "This is part of the evolutionary  process—and its happening ... this time it  isn't going to fade away."  Yet BC's Social Credit government continues to cater to the interests of forestry  and pulp and paper industries. Despite increasing pubhc pressure to enact strong  pulp miU regulations, with timelines for  the elimination of aU organochlorine discharges, ex-premier Vander Zalm personaUy thwarted his cabinet's proposed regulations by refusing to sign the order in councU. Vander Zalm's actions were a direct response to personal conversations with several industry executives. Since that time,  premier Rita Johnston maintains that "cabinet is prepared to approve a [lower level],  as suggested by the findings of a scientific  research program. The aim of this program  is to determine the actual toxicity of the re  spective levels so the health effects can be  identified".  In July, Dave Mercier, BC Minister of  the Environment, stated that the government's goal is "to work with industry towards zero discharge of wastes. WhUe this  goal is the ideal, it must be approached  without imposing costs that jeopardize ...  local economies dependent on the pulp and  paper industry." On the same day he affirmed the Socred's commitment to a "more  research" approach and to regulations that  allow the continued discharge of thousands  of tonnes of organochlorines every day.  In the meantime, federal government  testing programs are resulting in expanded  shellfishing closures and advisories limiting  consumption levels. Existing scientific research suggests that we know enough to predict that there wUl be damaging effects on  both aquatic species and human health as  organochlorines bioaccumulate. Experience  with organochlorine substances which have  been banned (such as PCBs, CFCs, DDT)  tells us that waiting for a body count could  result in irreversible damages.  Consumer Power  There is no need to go further than your  local grocery store to send an undeniably  strong message to the industry. Consumers  can aU take individual action in this way  and become part of a growing force of activists expressing their concern for the environment.  This simple fact was proven by the  founders of WEN several years ago. In  1988, they launched a campaign to stop  the manufacture of paper products from  pulp bleached with chlorine. The message  hit home within a short period of time and  by January 1989 two major companies had  announced they would convert to chlorine-  free pulp in their products and several other  companies soon foUowed suit.  Environmental organizations worldwide  have long been calling for the elimination  of aU chlorine-based bleaching agents in the  pulp production process. Catherine Stewart, regional director of Greenpeace Vancouver, suggests that: "everyone can help  achieve this goal through consumer choices  and action in the marketplace. It is a matter of tailoring personal consumption patterns to fit new patterns of environmental  There are some simple questions we can  ask ourselves each time we consider a purchase of a product containing wood fibre.  • Is this product necessary? H the answer  is no—stop here.  • Is there a re-usable alternative? The use  of sponges, cloth napkins, tablecloths,  handkerchiefs, and cloth diapers wUl disconnect you from the destruction of our  forests for the sake of a one-time use paper product.  • Is the product free of aU chlorine-based  bleaching agents? Many products are  being marketed as "chlorine-free" even  though they are bleached with chlorine  dioxide—don't be fooled by this misnomer. If the label does not explicitly answer this question, a letter to the company is your next step.  • Is the product made of recycled fibre? If  it is, has the fibre been rebleached with a  chlorine-containing compound? There is  no reason for disposable tissue products  to be rebleached.  • Would this product fulfil its purpose if it  were not bright white?

That  new sun has come; we have seen the first light of that new sun at this conference,  I believe." —Alma Brooks, Wabanoag Nation, Canada.  Alma Brooks was one of 35 women who came from around the world to share their experiences at the Healing the Earth conference in Vancouver last May. Women traveUed  from 20 different countries, representing the continents and major islands, as weU as at  least eight Native nations in Canada. An audience of 200 participants joined them, with  one major concern in common—the preservation of the environment.  The purpose of the conference was to reflect on women's values and perceptions regarding the environment. Healing the Earth, organized by the United Nations Association and  the Northern Institute for Conservation Research was held in preparation for Earth Summit, the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED '92)  scheduled for 1992 in BrazU.  The conference succeeded in dealing with both local and global issues. Women's strategies were developed and appear below in the form of a conference statement. Strong links  among concerned individuals were developed to continue the dialogue that was begun here.  The tone of the three days of dehberations was set during the opening ceremony conducted by indigenous women from around the world. The talking stick was passed around  to aUow these women to speak from the heart. The ceremony was concluded with the  Friendship Dance, in which aU participants and guests took part.  It was indeed a historic moment, where women from aU corners of the earth were embarking together on a three-day mission to make a difference in nurturing and protecting  our environment. Each of us has a role to play, whether we hve in a city or a viUage, in the  mountains or the vaUey, in the Arctic or at the Equator, in marshland or in the desert. The  problem is that we have elevated ourselves to a management position. We hope that we  can succeed in the management of toxic waste, of poUution, of elephants and whales—but  Chernobyl wasn't an example of good management, was it? Quality of hfe is often confused  with standard of hving. In the past, women lacked access to the resources and technology  required to work the land. However, with the ongoing efforts of women in promoting equal  access to resources, we can make a significant difference in nurturing and healing the earth.  We recognize that instituting change wUl require moving away from a materialistic,  consumer-oriented value system and beginning an internal healing process which acknowledges our interdependence with the earth. Empowerment comes through action.  As women at the conference stated: "The world is an island with limited resources. We,  as women, are implicitly working towards the recovery of the environment, reclaiming cultural heritage, maintaining diversity in the eco-system, developing appropriate technology  and embracing the principle of cooperation and respect for hfe."  The following is the statement developed by the women at "Healing the  Earth—Women's Strategies for the  Environment."  Gender and Empowerment  Women as primary food producers must be  present and heard at the UN conference in  BrazU in 1992. As women we are usuaUy  the first to experience environmental problems; in our reproductive faUures and contaminated breast milk, to name but a few.  Women want a cooperative, balanced, interdependent society.  We must recognize and eradicate dependencies internal to dominating societies.  Empowering comes from within a people  and their communities, and cannot be imposed from "outside." We denounce the violation of human rights, and as women take  responsibihty and commit ourselves to the  support of other women. We endorse the  Special Resolution of Women's Commission  to the First Continental Indigenous Conference in Quito, Ecuador in July, 1990.  We recognize that instituting change wUl  require moving away from a materialistic,  consumer-oriented value system and beginning an internal healing process which acknowledges our interdependence with the  earth. Empowerment comes through action.  Social justice and pohtical hberation wUl  bring about the resolutions of basic human  needs, environmental concerns and equahty  for women. Working toward the attainment  of self-sufficiency and democracy wUl require recognizing and supporting organizations that truly represent, among others: indigenous, disabled, rural, and urban women.  Militarism  Mihtarism and disarmament must be on the  agenda for UNCED '92 in BrazU.  Pubhc subsidization of military manufac-  tur ing—its waste disposal, testing, sale, deployment and use—is the single most destructive force to the environment. War is a  major factor in the depletion of agricultural  land, and is the single largest generator of  refugees and human misery. Understanding  the implications for global warming, we call  upon the community of nations to lend aU  necessary assistance to immediately extinguish the oU fires burning in Kuwait.  The "war on drugs" is being used as a  justification for the infringement on human  Public [subsidies for]  military  manufacturing...is the  single most destructive  force to the  environment.  rights and is degrading the environment  with pesticides and chemical defohants, destroying aU vegetation and contaminating  ground water supphes.  We call for the implementation of an International Arms Registry and an International Toxic Waste Registry citing the manufacturer and state of origin of aU arms sales  and toxic waste materials.  We call for an international conference to  devise ways to achieve effective non-violent  resolutions to conflicts.  And we recognize that institutionalized  violence against women, including wife battering, is destructive to the environment,  the community and the condition of chUdren. We demand that it be stopped.  Decolonization  The UNCED '92 conference must recognize  the effect that 500 years of colonization has  had on indigenous peoples and their environment. Governments must desist in their  use of military tactics to suppress any resistance by the original peoples to the in  vasion of their traditional homelands, as  witnessed in Kanesatake (Oka) and Kahnawake, Canada, against the Mohawk Nation. Governments that perpetuate genocide and who are responsible for the "disappeared," must be held accountable and  have sanctions imposed by the international  community.  Governmental, military, religious and  economic systems of colonization must  be dismantled. There can be no healing  of the earth unless indigenous peoples'  right to sovereignty, self-sufficiency, self-  determination and self-government are recognized and affirmed throughout the world.  Indigenous peoples' spiritual relationship  with the land must be respected and they  must be involved in decision-making on  environmental and resource matters. The.  world's indigenous peoples must be integral  to the process, and have delegate status at  UNCED '92.  Indigenous peoples'  spiritual relationship  with the land must be  ^respected...  Community Development  Internationally, the wealthy consume the  overwhelming majority of world agricul-  turaUy extracted and harvested resources.  Predominantly tied international development assistance does not redress the international cash flow to the wealthier industrialized countries. Women's work and  nature are treated as valueless expendable commodities. In the hght of past  practices, communities—and particularly  women—must be compensated with financial resources so that they can take primary responsibihty for defining what development means within a local context. In  order to conserve and protect the environment, communities must be involved in the  decisions that affect, among others: local  forestry; agriculture; education; community  infrastructure; and primary healthcare.  We caU upon UNCED '92 to establish a  forum to implement a right-to-know pohcy  as a means of controlling the transnational  shipment of environmentally hazardous materials and technology.  Agriculture, Food, Nutrition,  Nature and Conservation  Hierarchical, patriarchal systems of agri-  cul ture—like the "Green Revolution"—  that stimulate an export-oriented development of hybrid monoculture cash crops, dependent on corporately-controlled chemical  pesticides and fertilizers, must be replaced  by a globaUy-sustainable, regionaUy self-  sufficient production of nutritionally balanced food crops. Indigenous peoples' scientific knowledge of land or water-based animals, plants and seeds must be given equal  status with modern science. Support needs  to be given to local community initiatives  that are gathering and saving local seeds to  maintain genetic diversity. Legislation enabling governments and transnationals to  patent the production of seeds and other genetic material must be reversed.  The International Community must put  an end to global sod erosion. It must  severely restrict the diversion of water for  industrial purposes.  Education  Beginning with the chUdren, bringing a  women's perspective to a sustainable future requires the restoring, respecting and  revering of the interconnectedness of hfe.  Women, in particular, need equal opportunity and access to education. Environmental issues need to be learned, both in theory  within the educational system, and in practice in the natural world.  See EARTH page 10  KINESIS International  EARTH from page 9  We need to learn from land-based cultures the world over—by respecting their  phUosophy, history, culture, laws and techniques of sharing knowledge.  The following are excerpts from presentations by three women who spoke  on the first day of the conference.  Cree Nation (Quebec)  Chief Violet Pancharas of the Cree Nation (Quebec) on the hydro project in  James Bay:  We are the Cree Nation of Quebec. We  hve up in the northern territory in James  Bay. We are a people who made an agreement with both governments, Canada and  Quebec, when they wanted to buUd their  first hydro development in our territory, and  we are stiU fighting the governments to respect that agreement. But in aUowing them  "We do not think the  dam will benefit [the  Cree]:'  to buUd that project at that time, I guess  there's no stopping them. They keep changing them, buUding more to it, and now we  are faced again with what we now refer to  as "James Bay Two" [Great Whale]. Attempts at environmental assessment have  since been made, but the hves of the nine  Cree communities and the Inuit people have  been drastically changed.  We hved off the land. Our people were  hunters and trappers. The rivers were our  highways, and our source of diet also came  from the land. And along with this hydro  development, we have to deal with poUution  in the form of the mercury in the diet, in  the fish and the animals. We had to turn to  buying food in the stores and our cultures  have been affected, too.  We do not think that the dam wUl benefit us. It wUl benefit mostly the New England states at the expense of the environment ...  Lesotho (Southern Africa)  Tseli Mapetla from Lesotho, South  Africa on soil erosion and fertility loss:  The country is the most eroded country that I have known. We're talking about  the human costs of soil erosion here and I  want to say that women do contribute to  degradation of the environment in Lesotho.  The women have to collect firewood to fulfil their household tasks and because they  don't have alternative resources, they go out  and cut down trees and in winter they wUl  coUect leftover stalks from the fields. What  this means is that the stalks are not planted  back into the soil, and the soil structure becomes weak. Women in Lesotho have played  a great role in the tree planting and soil  conservation. Unfortunately, due to poverty,  the women wUl go back and cut the- very  trees that they have planted due to lack of  firewood.  I don't think that any woman would  stand to wait for a tree to grow over 20  years whUe her chUdren are dying! However,  projects supported by Canada are working  on providing management skiUs for women,  who make up 85 percent of the project,  to carry out the activities of viable agro-  forestry methods. They are planting indigenous trees, exotic trees and fruit trees together so that whUe they provide nutrition,  they are also able to arrest soil erosion. Education is also identified as a main tool to  help women work hand-in-hand to restore  the environmental degradation in the area.  "/ don't think any  woman would...wait for  a tree to grow...while  her children are  dying."  Marshall Islands (South Pacific)  Biram Siege from the Marshall Islands  on nuclear testing:  The Marshall Islands are about 2,000  miles south of Hawaii, and southward from  Johnson Island where the nuclear testing  was done and the nerve gas is stored. The  population totals about 40,000 people. The  Marshall Islanders were displaced from the  Bikini Islands because of nuclear testing.  You don't have your land and there is a constant yearning to go back to the land which  is passed from mother to daughter.  The nuclear testing doesn't only affect  the relocation of people, but also their culture and diet. The new island did not have  lagoons to aUow us to fish and only meagre  agriculture to support us. During the "testing," the wind was blowing toward the islands where people hved. They started getting this powder substance on their hands  and they started losing hair. Today we find  some of the long-term effects of the radioactive faUout: more and more incidents of cancer and genetic disorders, miscarriages, stiU-  births and what they call jellyfish babies—  they don't look human at all.  Mihtarism has also plagued the islands.  The US military has taken over the largest  island as a base for testing its missUes. The  Native population has been removed, relocated to an island much smaller where they  are ferried back and forth every day to get  jobs on their military base. You have created a crowded, crowded condition—at one  time it was called the slum of the Pacific.  We have also been a very attractive site to  transport aU the garbage from the United  States, supposedly to increase our land size  Videos and proceedings of the conference (including all the presentations) will be available in the near future.

I've been thinking an awful lot about hair  lately.  Today I remembered that when I was a  teenager, and definitely not yet actively sexual, I was terrified of boys who were getting hair on their legs, on their faces, on the  knuckle of their big toes. But above all it  was the hair under their arms that blew all  my circuits, because to me that meant that  they were p-p-p-p-p-o-tent, that they had  the potential to im-p-p-p-p-reg—Oh jesus!  It was just too explosive for me.  That previously unremarkable corner of  a boy's body was suddenly a public private  place, though in my mind it was meant to  be as sweetly vulnerable as a little ldd raising his arms to take off his shirt. A place to  tickle. To me the hairy underarm was more  threatening than the arrow of hair pointing  downward from the navel or the thickening  patches at the top of the thighs. When each  and every one of my male friends betrayed  me by growing underarm hair, I lapsed into  sexual hibernation for another half decade.  When I woke up, I eventually accepted,  then hked, then revelled in body hair on  men, though it took longer for me to accept it on women and still longer for me to  like it on my own body. For me, hair is a vital, even rebellious, sign of my own adult female sexuality, a sexuahty I have not always  been ready, willing or able to own. For others, the fact that I have less than an inch of  hair on my head but more than an inch of  hair on my body, signifies gender and cultural deviance.  I'm stunned at the power of hair to attract, to repel and to disrupt. At the beach  I feel hke Medusa, as the neighbours drop  their straw-hat-covered-heads and seem to  talk to my armpit. Studies will be written  on the mesmeric qualities of women's underarm hair! Yes, I will tell you now, there are  many who think that I have hair in all the  wrong places. That it fell off my head and  under my arms and onto my legs. There are  days when I have to remind myself that even  according to the most mainstream medical  texts, I grow hair in all the right places: you  know, on the head, under the arms, on the  legs, between the legs, around the nipples.  Even that wild hair on my neck, under my  chin—the one that seems to grow overnight  (the one my lover calls my fertility hair)—  are considered normal biological facts. Some  of us grow more, some of us grow less. Some  of us display more, some of us less. So who's  to say what's "natural," let alone beautiful or feminine? Especially when the norm  would suggest that we are in fact hairless.  There are few women among us who do  not, at some time in their hves, feel deeply  ambivalent about the hair on their bodies.  Two sisters, both friends of mine, take op-  He stands. One says that shaving is "disgusting," while the other argues that not  shaving is twice as "disgusting."  The word that bothers me here is disgust  ing: we women are still filled with contempt  and loathing for our bodies. In her recent  book, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf suggests this is the way the wheels of capital  hke it, for if we were content with our bodies, we might not be spending big bucks to  shave, pluck, colour, electrocute and burn  certain parts. In the USA, the head hair industry alone grosses upwards of $2.5 billion  annually. You don't have to ask twice about  how aesthetics, economics and pohtics are  interrelated. They're positively inbred.  Wolf also argues that the more inroads  women have made into previously male-  dominated arenas, the more we have been  subjected to and affected by impossible  standards of female beauty that will always make us exiles in our own bodies. In  a similar vein, in the July issue of Saturday Night, Margaret Visser points out the  it ever really surfaced. Body hair was not  part of puberty for girls—shaving was.  Today I'm troubled that almost 20 years  later we seem only to have two ideologically  restrictive options available to us: there is  the supposedly unraised consciousness of  the "hair remover" or the righteous path of  the hairy—she who has rescued her sexuahty from the male created/dominated vision of woman as hairless child. (See Germaine Greer, Rosalind Cowaxd, et al. on  infantalized female sexuahty.) But hold on  just a second! Is this really a choice? I'm uncomfortable with my own knee-jerk associations with each of these visions of woman.  One woman I know expresses similar ex-  ...hair is a vital, even rebellious, sign of my own adult  female sexuality, a sexuality I have not always been ready,  willing or able to own...  entomological aspect of recent bathing suit  fashions for women: that is, the way that  swimweai has progressively exaggerated the  female body into an insect-like shape. Curious isn't it, when everything from cars to  pop bottles seems to resemble a stylized female shape, yet women themselves are not  to resemble women.  The other fact about recent bathing suit  fashion is the euphemistically designated  "bikini hne." Let's face it, there is a qualitative difference between removing hair from  your underarms or legs and removing it  from your pubic region. I'm talking about  pure pain, not just aesthetics. Apparently  Marilyn Monroe bleached even her pubic  hairs blonde and in this we read her as the  tragic victim of mascuhnist ideals of female  beauty. But honestly, how much perspective  do we have?  I wonder, then, if we are gaining any  ground at all in terms of taking possession  of our own bodies, in terms of inhabiting  our own sexuahty and allowing for broader  and smarter and more creative images of female beauty? This is hardly a new question.  Some will remember the very first Ms. magazine, way back in July of 1972, when floating on the swells of second wave feminism,  that inaugural issue ran the article "Body  Hair: The Last Frontier." Of course in 1972  I was too busy running away from boys with  underarm hair to even consider my own, let  alone read articles about it. And besides, it  was a non-issue. In my environment (white,  middle class, suburban) it just never came  up because you'd whacked it off long before  asperation. She says, "I did my hairy leg  thing for a long time, but you know what?  I finally realized I have great calves so I've  shaved them ever since. But I don't shave  my underarms. What gets me down is the  pohticaUy correct fascista who claim I'm  a lousy feminist because I shave my legs.  That is just bullshit." What I'm attracted  to in this woman's statement is the sense  of affirmation, that great big yes to what  her body is and the personal aesthetic she  has fashioned from it. She understands the  camps, but she's created a new one for herself, based on what she is, not on what everyone is saying she can be.  There has been an awful lot of negative commentary about how much time and  money women spend constructing themselves as passive sex objects. Well, I'd hke  to suggest that women can and do enjoy  shaping themselves as active sexual subjects. And I love outrageous beaudacious-  ness. Hair, hke makeup, is fantastically ma-  nipulable and can be fantastically creative,  as long as there exist real choices about how,  where and when to manipulate it. Too often  it's our socialized standards of beauty that  manipulate us.  While some may subvert the social control of images simply by inverting them, we  have to leave room for other counter images  of female beauty. And part of that process  will be revaluing the less fetishized parts of  our bodies and working toward a sort of decentralized sexuality. Like the woman who  loves her calves, I love the shape of my head.  That is one of the reasons why I cut my  hair down to almost nothing. And I also love  the dark hair under my very white arms.  A friend laughs and says it's a sign of my  French-Canadian heritage. I have a fantasy  that some day we'll do underarm hair extensions so we can bead it and braid it and  wear it proudly or even ironically; or maybe  men and women with lots of hair on their  legs will shave out pictures or cartoons. I  once saw a man with the profile of Barney  Rubble (of The Flintstones) shaved out of  his hairline. Body art. It's the next wave.  Trust me.  Now there are a lot of people who will  say feminists have more important issues  to think about than body hair and, while  that may be true, I'm not sure we can fight  the other fights without also reckoning with  our bodies. We wear ideology on our bodies,  but while our bodies are easily inscribed,  they are less easily decoded. Sometimes it  is not our own ideology that we wear and,  interestingly, hair has often been an initial  site of rebellion among those who have internalized dominant power structures. Currently lesbians, punks and skinheads use  hair as a pohtical arena and earlier this  century, Malcom X decried the conk (the  lye-straightened hair style popular among  African-Americans of his generation) as a  symbol of the psychological enslavement of  Blacks to white ideals. Not coincidentally,  the Afro (and the bigger the better) came  to signify Black consciousness during the  Black Power movement of the '60s and '70s.  The long hair of the hippies likewise operated subversively against establishment values, ultimately symbolizing sexual hberation as well as an initial breakdown of gender stereotypes.  Hair and sexuahty are, in fact, commonly  hnked in psychoanalysis, hairiness being associated with aggressive sexuality, while extremes of haircutting, hair covering, etc.,  signify rape or castration. Here I think of  one of the most horrifying stories that circulated in my highschool about a boy who  violently cut off the waist-length hair of  his girlfriend on graduation night. For men,  group identity (and what might be read as  the symbolic castration of the self) is often  characterized by an initiation ritual of shaving the head. We see it in the military, in  prisons, in team sports and in certain religious practices.  The false notion that masculinity and  femininity can operate only in opposition to  one another is common: men have body hair  women do not; men minimize the hair on  their heads women maximize it. We seem to  forget that these ideals are reductive, sexist  and racist; we forget that some men grow  httle or no body hair or that a woman's  mustache can be considered sexy in many  cultures. But here, and in most places I've  See HAIR page 14  KINESIS 'tikler  Are breast implants a form of medical abuse?  Breast implants. The vast majority of North American v  who undergo breast implant surgery do so for non-medical reasons.  "Breast augmentation" promises a woman better breasts: bigger,  smaller, rounder, higher, pointier.... The sexist underpinnings  of this quest for improved breasts are not hard to unearth: in this  society, women are rarely encouraged to like, let alone love, their  bodies as they really are.  The following article, prompted by the health and political scandal surrounding the Meme breast implant, explores breast implants  as a form of medical abuse.  by Heidi Walsh  This is the story of North American women who were given silicone  breast implants for breast augmentation or following radical surgery.  During the first afterglow of their operations, they were treated hke  heroines of medical progress. But when things went alarmingly wrong,  they became an embarrassment to the surgeons who operated on them  and the government department that should have protected them.  Now after years of being shunted aside, their pain and depression is  turning to anger, and they are starting to talk. If you Usten to them,  and the very few doctors and researchers who are taking them seriously,  you will uneasily begin to sense that these women are just the thin edge  of the wedge. Women with silicone breast implants—about 100,000 in  Canada and 2.3 million in the US—may be walking medical disasters.  As silicone leaks into their bodies, we may be looking at an issue as  large as, if not larger than, the Dalkon Shield scandal.  Joanne Tomlin of Mission, BC was 23 in 1978 when she decided  to undergo cosmetic breast surgery. She was a nurse's aide, an ex-  competitive swimmer and newly married. She discussed this decision  with her family and plastic surgeon, and chose saline-filled implants because she'd read some bad reports about silicone.  In 1990, after years of chronic pain, a plastic surgeon determined her  left implant had ruptured. Only then did Tomlin discover she had been  implanted with silicone prostheses. Her original plastic surgeon had lied  when he told her they were saline-filled.  "For years," says Tomlin, "I thought that the negative things I'd  heard about silicone implants didn't apply to me because I had the 'safe  ones'."  Tomlin's health battle began almost immediately after her initial  implant surgery, as did her battle to convince doctors she was not a  hypochondriac. She experienced severe pain in her left breast which progressively worsened; later, she developed a loss of balance, blurry vision and extreme chills. Tomlin has since experienced excruciating chest  pain, extreme fatigue, anxiety and depression-hke symptoms.  "I was sent to a psychiatrist because [the doctors] couldn't figure out  what was wrong with me," Tomlin says. "You go to these doctors and  they're not looking at your pain because they don't beheve you're in  pain, but that you're suffering from a form of mental illness."  Last year Tomlin finally found a local doctor who would hsten. He  urged her to get her implants checked and the rupture was discovered.  Tomlin has since had the implants removed, but her symptoms persist.  Eight months ago she had to give up her job because of constant pain  and fatigue.  "The Pain was Excruciating"  Three years ago, Marcella Tardif, a fashion promoter from Montreal,  was diagnosed with breast cancer. After undergoing several biopsies and  five operations, she agreed in July 1990 to a total mastectomy and reconstructive surgery using silicone implants.  H somebody had told her the implants she received were called the  Meme (pronounced "mem"), she would have just shrugged. The name  didn't mean anything to her. However, had she known that meme implants were covered in polyurethane foam, she would have refused on  the spot. Having worked for Hoover Chemicals, Tardif knew it was an  industrial-grade material, and she also knew that one of the only glues  to which it bonds is similar to the type used in bathroom sealers. She  did not know that once inside the breast, the foam and glue begin to  disintegrate and embed themselves in breast tissue.  Like 17,000 other women across the country who received the  Meme—the vast majority in Quebec—Tardif trusted her plastic surgeon  to give her the highest quahty implants. She had no way of knowing  that nine months later, Health and Welfare Canada would reluctantly  pull the brand from the market because tests had hnked it to cancer.  While on her honeymoon in early 1991, Tardif's left breast swelled  up and began secreting. The lymph nodes on her left side swelled up as  well, as did her face. "The pain was excruciating," she says.  Back in Montreal, her plastic surgeon said there was nothing wrong  with her, that her symptoms probably came from the stress of the trip  and climatic changes. He added that she was probably "menopausal."  Tardif has noticed on two occasions since then, when she has infections in other parts of her body, such as a toothache or kidney infection, "the implants act hke a magnet, and" the infection goes right up  into my breasts. It starts as an incredible pain and my breasts become  enormous. With the kidney infection, they hurt so much I couldn't even  move." At this point, testing indicates the polyurethane foam or the  glue are attracting the infections. She is hoping to find a surgeon who  will remove the implants in the fall.  "When I first agreed to have implants, I was happy," says Tardif. "I  thought, just give me something, at least I can keep a httle bit of femininity in me and feel hke a woman. But I wanted to keep my dignity.  What [the doctors and government] have done is walk all over that dignity. All my hfe, I've taken good care of myself and for what? For someone to put products in my body that we're putting into car seats and  In 1985, on the advice of two surgeons, Linda Wilson of Delta, BC  underwent mastectomies to put an end to recurring benign cysts in her  breasts. She was fitted with Meme implants, although she was not aware  of the brand at the time.  Her right breast became infected almost immediately and the surgeon removed the implant after six weeks. Because the implant covering  was disintegrating, much of the foam and attached glue remained in her  breast after the removal procedure. She endured the same horror when  her left breast became infected a few months later.  It took a further seven operations and nine silicone implants until  Wilson had breasts that looked human. Subsequent problems included  nipple deformity, one implant travelling up towards her shoulder, and  other implants meeting and rubbing against each other at the sternum.  Were this the full extent of her difficulties with breast implants, Wilson's story would be troublesome enough. But there is much more.  After the initial operation, Wilson developed lumps and swelling in  her groin; the skin around that area would periodically break and release a discharge. Last April, Wilson underwent surgery to have the area  excised, although the infection has since begun again. Sample tissue sent  to Laval University for analysis revealed that Wilson has a fungus in her  body which prevents normal healing. Even a small cut to her skin can  result in painful swelling. The fungus, it turns out, originated from the  polyurethane and glue surrounding her Meme implants.  In the last two and a half years, Wilson has also had pain in her  shoulders, neck and spinal column. Silicone has leaked into her breasts  and although some has been removed, a recent mammogram points to  the possibility that there is still more.  Since 1988 Wilson has been waging a remarkable fight against the  Meme in the courts and at the government level (see Kinesis, April  1991). But Wilson also has grave concerns about all silicone implants.  "Women with the Meme have what I call 'the Double Whammy'," says  Wilson. "Once the polyurethane has disintegrated, they're still left with  the silicone implants, and silicone is a substance that is causing serious  problems of its own."  A Lifetime of Ten Years  Breast implants were first introduced to North America in the early  1960's and there are now about 50 different brands available. By far the  most frequently used implants are those which are encased in a silicone  bag filled with silicone gel. Sometimes, as with the Meme, the bag is  covered in a 3mm layer of polyurethane foam. Saline-filled implants have  traditionally been less popular, although with increasing concerns about  the effects of silicone, their market share may grow.  Little information has been available to women considering breast implants for either breast augmentation—which accounts for 70-90 percent  of breast implant surgery—or for reconstructive surgery. They have thus  made two critical and dangerous assumptions: that the implants on the  market are safe, and that plastic surgeons are acting in their patients'  best interests.  Since 1983, high risk medical devices such as breast implants have  been subject to approval by a federal government agency before being  allowed on the Canadian market. This regulation was not made retroactive, however, and devices sold before 1983, including many brands of  breast implants, continued to be sold as before.  Initial implants were quite sturdy, made with thick walls to hold in  the silicone gel. In the early 1970s, however, plastic surgeons asked the  manufacturers to make the walls thinner: they were easier and quicker  to insert. They were more fragile too, and much more prone to rupture,  leaking silicone into the body. (Because of their failure rate, after 1985,  manufacturers again began to make the walls thicker. Implants made after this time are often of a higher quality.)  Some plastic surgeons advise women of possible hazards; most commonly mentioned are the possibihty of encapsulation—a painful hardening of the breast as scar tissue forms around the implant—and the possibility of rupture. Others allow the myth that implants last "a hfetime"  to go unchallenged. Current research indicates that a good quality prosthesis lasts about 10 years, and a poor quality one only about five.  Meet Dr. Pierre Blais of Montre'al. For 13 years a leading scientist at  the Department of Health and Welfare's Bureau of Radiation and Medical Devices, he was fired in 1989 following his uncompromising position  that the Meme was unsuitable for human implantation. Blais now runs  Innoval, a private consulting group which performs failure analysis on  breast implants and other medical devices.  Researchers hke Blais are becoming an embarrassment to some pohticians, surgeons and implant manufacturers. At present, their voices are  small, but their growing research shows that when silicone from breast  implants is released inside the body, it can have a profoundly detrimental effect.  Build-Up of Poisons  Blais estimates that about 50 percent of all women will have significant  problems requiring surgery or medical treatment between the fourth to  seventh year after implantation. Some common problems include the  hardening of breast tissue (up to 30 percent), and chemical deterioration  of the implant (20-25 percent). Deterioration of the implant shell can  lead to silicone gel escaping into the body.  Close to 100 percent of women with implants older than 10 years will  experience problems, says Blais. "A few [women] carry them beyond  that," he adds, "but not without considerable risk." To those surgeons  who tell women the implants will outlive them, Blais says: "This makes  no more sense than giving a balloon to a child and saying it's going to  last a hfetime."  Many women with silicone implants experience aches and pains in  their joints, shoulders and neck, tiredness and trouble focusing. In their  mild forms, these complaints are similar to symptoms of aging, and doctors often dismiss them as such in middle-aged women.  More aggressive manifestations of these symptoms can also occur, resembling arthritis-like pain, chronic migraine-like headaches, memory  loss, nerve pain and the thickening and discoloration of the skin. The  symptoms show httle response to standard medication. Researchers are  labelling the symptoms "Human Adjuvant Disease", although variations  of this name also exist.  Blais beheves the silicone itself is benign. However, once it leaks into  the lymphatic system, it acts as a plug. "It's hke pouring hot fat down a  sink," he says, "the sink gets clogged." If the system is plugged, tiredness occurs due to the build-up of poisonous substances in the muscles; debris build-up in the joints can lead to auto-immune disease when  other "clean-up cells" (macrophages) mistake healthy tissue for debris  and begin attacking it. "The lymphatic system is also supposed to protect us from infection," says Blais. "If it's plugged solid, your guess is as  good as mine as to what will happen."  Dr. Steven Wiener, a director of two arthritis care centres in Cahfornia, has been studying silicone breast implant recipients with rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms for 10 years. He estimates that almost 1  percent of recipients develop severe symptoms, translating into about  24,000 women "walking around in North America with unexplained  rheumatic diseases."  Breast implants do not have to rupture in order for silicone to escape  into the body. The implants are by nature permeable, and small traces  of the substance can. seep through the implant's outer shell as a result of  everyday activities. "Because the breast is externally exposed [not protected by the skeleton]," explains Wiener, "it undergoes by definition a  fair amount of trauma—for example, every time a woman lays down on  her chest or gets hugged."  Cautioning that he has not yet proven a hnk between silicone and  the symptoms, Wiener has found, however, that of his patients who had  their implants removed, one-third showed a fairly rapid improvement,  and another third improved over a period of 12-24 months.  What To Do?  Because of wide media attention given to the Meme implant in recent  months, many Meme recipients are in a dilemma. Should ihey have the  implants removed immediately or should they play a waiting game?  Women with other types of silicone implants are beginning to ask themselves the same questions.  Pierre Blais recommends that all new implant recipients have a mammogram fairly soon after surgery, and every two years after that. "These  should be done as much for cancer detection as for observing the integrity of the implant," he says. Many women falsely beheve that having  implants reheves them of the need for mammograms.  Because a regular mammogram involves fairly rough handling of the  breasts, women with implants should demand special—gentle—attention  from technicians. If possible, a "Xerogram", which produces a highly  sensitive image more clearly showing any implant decomposition and silicone leakage, should be taken, says Blais. However, the Xerogram is not  available throughout the country.  Women with implants five years or older should have mammograms  on an annual basis, says Blais, increasing them to every eight months as  they approach the eight year mark, where the implant nears the end of  its hfe. "Women with the Meme should have mammograms every year  from the beginning, and increase them around the five year point." Blais  beheves that the danger of a malfunctioning implant far outweighs the  danger associated with x-ray radiation.  If the implant has ruptured, Blais recommends swift action, saying  the woman has "about 2 to 3 months before running into serious trouble." She should have the rupture confirmed with a dehcately-performed  mammogram and find a surgeon to remove the implant, he says. While  awaiting surgery, she should refrain from strenuous exercise or activities  that dramatically shift the position of the breast or put pressure on it.  Getting Together  Many women experiencing complications with their implants have felt  unbearably isolated. A mixture of embarrassment—especially where the  implants were for cosmetic reasons—lack of information, disinterest on  the part of many physicians or in other cases, their inability to accurately diagnose symptoms, has led women to beheve they are unique  Joy Langan, federal NDP labour critic and implant recipient herself,  sees the silence shrouding breast implants as part of something larger.  "Doctors don't take women's health that seriously and they tend to  classify us as being chronic complainers. And because women don't have  the networks that men have, it is easier to perceive us as isolated incidents than as a group of people with a problem."  Referring specifically to the Meme, Langan, who was active in pressuring for its withdrawal from the market, says, "I think if 17,000 men  in this country had some kind of implant that was a serious danger to  their health, there would have been much faster action. Doctors and  pohticians are predominantly male, so they react to things they can en-  visualize happening to them." Langan has called for an official enquiry  into the federal governments' handling of the Meme scandal.  Langan, together with Linda Wilson of Delta, BC and Marcella  Tardif of Montreal, recently formed a support group network for breast  implant recipients called "I Know/Je Sais." The three women met with  federal Health Minister Benoit Bouchard at the end of July to ask that  more stringent controls be applied to breast implants for sale in Canada,  and that more straightforward information be made available to women  with implants or those considering them.  In describing the origin of the network's name, Wilson explains: "The  three of us had found that whenever we talked to other women with  breast implants about our symptoms, we were always saying to each  other 'yes, I know, I know what you mean.' Because of our experiences,  we had a common language and each of us realized we weren't alone."  Currently, the network's main priority is "to get as much information  out there to women as we possibly can, to hsten to them and support  them," says Wilson. Women are assured confidentiahty and do not have  to give their real names.  In Montre'al, where Meme recipients are heavily concentrated, Marcella Tardif is receiving about 100 calls a week. In Delta, Wilson has  been getting one or two phone calls a day, and recently held the first  support group meeting. Many of the women are talking about the implants for the first time; in some cases, their partners are not even aware  they have them.  Wilson says that with silicone breast implants, a new patient's code  now apphes: "You can no longer depend on the medical companies or  doctors—you're on your own. Keep yourself informed by joining other  n who are working on your concerns."  For more information on I Know/Je Sais, contact: Marcella  Tardif; #503-12024 Blvd. Lachapelle, Montreal, PQ, H4J 2M4.

Maybe it's just one toilet too many or  the vacuum cleaner doesn't want to suck up  any more dustballs or the chent wants too  ich done in the amount of time she is prepared to pay for. Cleaning up other people's  mess is real shitty work. But it's work and  at least I get paid to do it. When I'm really  feehng sorry for myself I think of the millions of mothers and/or wives who are part  of what someone once referred to as "the  love economy" and who do the work not for  money but for "love." What a rip-off!  I also think of the women for whom working as a cleaner is not one of many options  but the only option they have to obtain  the currency they need to feed and shelter  themselves. The women who work for one  month to make the kind of money I make in  a day. Who move far away from their homes  and families in order to do this and who may  only see their children once a year.  I chose to do this. I chose to resign from  my job, sell my car and all my furniture in  order to leave a pervasively oppressive country and to start a new hfe somewhere else. I  know I am extremely fortunate to have been  able to do that. But that doesn't make my  experiences any easier. I get depressed when  I have to go downtown to the Immigration  office at 5:30 am to be seen by an officer at  10:30 am who may say "No" to all my requests.  going to make Annah's hfe easier, here is  a sobering fact. The South African government's abolishment of the Land Acts and  the Group Areas Act means that the meagre  land that was set aside for 87 percent of the  population is being bought up by wealthy  ...we will always have some women...cleaning the toilets of  other women who will be discussing their nanny problems  over lunch.  I get depressed when people say, "Isn't  it great that the South African government  is making all those changes?" when I know  that 25 people are dying every day at  the hands of the same government's death  squads and their ilk.  But usually the thought of not being  in the shoes of Annah Dlamini, a Xhosa  woman in South Africa—a victim of everything in the grand apartheid plan, hving  in a barren "homeland," denied any education or access to the bounty of the land  of her ancestors—shakes me out of it. And  for those who think that the "changes" are  white businessmen because, after decades of  apartheid, they are the only ones with the  means to buy land.  And not only that, but these same businessmen now have the right to limit who  enters their property and can thus legitimately set up their own white homelands.  And so the world turns. Those who have,  get more, and those who don't, get less.  And if you think that thought is pessimistic  rather than realistic, your station in hfe is  probably better than most.  As for me, I don't know what my sta  tion in hfe is right now. Born middle class,  now getting a taste (for the past 18 months)  of what it means to be on the same economic rung as working class people, I don't  know what category I fit in. Getting enough  money to pay the rent is a strain rather  than an irritation. Impulsive buying of anything not absolutely essential produces days  of guilt. I don't know when last I bought  first-hand clothing. It's amazing how httle  you can hve on when you're forced to. It's  the necessity of having to hve hke this that  creates a lot of stress. I still have the luxury  of being able to think of this as. a temporary measure (on my good days ... ). But  I have yet to know how it must feel to think  about doing this for the rest of my hfe. I  defy anyone who hasn't actually done that  to say that they know how that feels.  There seems to be a perception amongst  middle class women that working class  women are stoic and are unwilling to "improve" their hves. They forget that access  to the economic means to "improvement'"  is controlled. The same forces in society  that have created the artificial groupings  called "middle" and "working" class also ensure their continuance so that we will always have some women who will be cleaning the toilets of other women who will be  discussing their nanny problems over lunch.  The whole issue 'round women of colour  is fraught with the similar problems of perception. Unlearning racism workshops may  go a long way toward helping white middle  class women to begin to change their perceptions, but they can never really know  how it feels. I once had an interesting experience with a young child I was babysitting.  While her mother was talking to me about  the day's events, her daughter sat next to  me and touched my forearm with the tips  of her fingers as if to feel my skin's colour. I  think in her own way she was trying to see if  I really was much different. I wish all my experiences with white people who do not normally socialize with people of colour were as  innocent. But they're not. And so racism is  just another load we have to deal with.  And sometimes that gets to be too  much.  Lizanne Foster is a woman of colour  from South Africa and a refugee.  HAIR from page 11  hved in Canada and the US, it seems hke  the hair on top of a woman's head is the  only sanctioned pubhc hair she can have. So  it can be a bit oversexuahzed. You know,  those do's that obscure most of your vision  in the name of sensuality. Pile it high, grow  it long, add as much as you want to your  head (sing "Ode to Priscilla Presley" here),  but for god's sake keep it off your body.  It is the idea that this aesthetic or its opposite is somehow "natural" and not just  one possibility among millions that is constricting to me and many other women (and  probably to a lot of men). Perhaps the hair  issue, the makeup issue and the body image  problems rampant among women will dissolve when we reclaim our bodies and minds  from colonizing media images and monolithic ideologies. The body is both a private  and a social entity, but as yet the pubhc aspect of our bodies has far eclipsed the personal. Many women over-identify with their  public images to the degree that the Self is  no more than the body.  When we really get inside our bodies the  choices for personalized aesthetic expression will be limitless. And then maybe, just  maybe, this freedom will allow us to think  about something else for a change.

The discussion has led to a reexamination  of classical images of women in art and has  also prompted debate about whether depicting our bodies is even a desirable way to  reclaim and redefine the image in our own  terms.  In her exhibit "On Display," shown in  July at the Pitt Gallery, Vancouver artist  Susan Edelstein takes up the challenge. In  a series of visual panels that both confront and delight, Edelstein tackles several  historical and contemporary problems concerning the portrayal of women's bodies.  Though not flawless, the work takes an intelligent and creative approach to representing female nudity, female sexuahty and lesbian sexuahty (in particular), while trying  to question the historical conventions that  have prescribed how these images are understood.  On Display" consists of seven large  framed panels, each with three components:  in the upper portion, a colour reproduction of a classical painting (photo emulsion  printed on fabric and covered by plexiglass);  across the middle, a band of text—black letters on black velvet; and at the bottom, a  black and white photograph by Edelstein  (again, printed on fabric).  Four of the paintings are fairly well-  known 19th century European nudes: Paul  Gauguin's "Tahitian Women with Mango  Blossoms", Edouard Manet's "Olympia,"  Ingres' "Odalisque and Slave," and Gustave  Courbet's representation of a lesbian scene  in "Sleep."  Another more obscure 19th century work  by Saint George Hair, called "Victory of  Faith," portrays two early Christians in a  prison below the Roman Coliseum, awaiting  their martyrdom in the hon's den (pictured  here). In this image, a nude Black woman  hes beside a white female companion (also  nude) whose hand is tethered to an iron ring  on the stone wall. Two other paintings come  from 16th century Japanese Shunja erotic  art: one portrays a woman masturbating,  the other shows two women kissing.  What these images share is their conformity to an erotic tradition of representing  the nude female as an object of desire for  a male viewer. Bodies twist and contort to  provide the spectator with the best possible  view of plump, ripe breasts or rounded buttocks (never mind that a number of the positions would be anatomically impossible to  achieve) and he passively on display, waiting to be "taken."  In the lower portion of each panel, Edel-  stein's photographs echo, but also alter the  classical images above, shifting relationships  within the image, and upsetting the relationship between viewer and image.  Her photos are stark—with totally black  backgrounds or dark velvet drapery. The  only props are occasional pillows under the  women's heads. While the models are all  in some way exposed—naked, portrayed in  sexual or intimate private moments—the  images are striking in how unavailable the  women appear. Some of them cover their  breasts or conceal parts of their bodies; several look out directly at the viewer. Seriously or defiantly, the women "talk back,"  almost challenging the viewer to justify the  act of looking. Others appear completely indifferent or oblivious.  The written words between the two panels suggest a critical view of how the paintings have "framed" women: "Their reality  was his fantasy;" "Sweet wine, strand of  pearls, his fantasy was complete;" "Colonized by his vision, the exotic other was  born." Some text evokes the missing perspective of woman as subject (rather than  object): "His positioning made her uncomfortable;" "Her pleasure was interrupted by  his gaze."  Edelstein's stated purpose is to question  our personal responses to these images and  challenge "how our vision has been socially  constructed through patriarchal eyes." She  has directly confronted the issue of lesbian  sexuahty and tried to reframe it on women's  terms. This is an important effort in a time  when the choice by many feminist artists  to abandon the female body in representation threatens to sacrifice a necessary exploration of lesbian imagery. Her lesbian  images struck me as celebratory, relaxed  and comfortably sensual, though only one  is overtly sexual.  Edelstein also raises a number of fundamental questions about creating images of  women's bodies and sexuality: How have  nudes been represented in traditional erotic  art? How has that art woven racial, colonial and class positions into its portrayal  of women? For whom were the images produced? How have these historical traditions  distorted how we create and understand images of women now?  How can feminist artists challenge these  conventions and redefine images of women?  How can they best address the issue of race  and class differences? These questions have  no right answers, of course, but Edelstein's  work takes the risk of exploring some possibilities.  Several of the original paintings Edelstein has chosen exemplify the popular 19th  century European practise of representing women as "exotic others," by merging  the notion of sexual conquest with colonial  domination.  For example, in Ingres' "Odalisque and  Above, "Victory of Faith", St. George Hair, 19th  century.  Below, Susan Edelstein's accompanying photograph.  Slave," a nude European woman hes voluptuously across a bed, looking towards a female servant (also European) who kneels at  her bedside playing the lute, while a Black  and turbanned male servant stands guard  in the background. The bed is surrounded  by signs of wealth and luxury, "exotic" artifacts from the Asian world, and yet is  enclosed by a railing that suggests imprisonment. Edelstein's text reads "Positioned  amongst his oriental artifacts she waited to  be taken."  The accompanying photograph shows  one white woman lying alone, arts covering her breasts, raised knee concealing her  genitals, who looks out at the viewer directly, yet somewhat indifferently. There are  no props to indicate her status or position.  However, her skin colour, youth and conventional beauty do place her in a relative position of privilege. This points to a limitation  in Edelstein's contemporary images: they  include only women who are fairly young,  healthy and traditionally "attractive." As  such, they occupy positions of privilege in  the arena of erotic imagery, so we are not  challenged to question our habitual definitions of the erotic on that level.  In another panel, Manet's "Olympia"  shows a European prostitute posing on an  ottoman, flower in hair, on display, while a  Black female servant attends to her from behind the bed.  Edelstein's photograph shows a nude  woman of Asian ancestry lying casually in  the foreground, while a white woman kneels  behind her. Both women stare directly and  defiantly out at the viewer. The artist alters racial positions in the composition and  challenges both their meanings. Yet she herself does not appear totally satisfied with  this simphstic role reversal. The text on this  panel reads: "Reversing the roles did not  create her identity."  By her own admission, it was more by  chance that one of Edelstein's models was  a woman of Asian ancestry, while the other  models she found were all Caucasian. Yet  she has tried out a number of ways of upsetting colonial and racist constructions-  reversing roles or removing the hierarchies  within an image. These work as a critique  of the artistic conventions, but as Edelstein  herself indicates, they do not "create an  identity" for the absent or silenced women.  Edelstein's inclusion of the two Japanese  Shunja pieces is both interesting and somewhat problematic. Though their sexual ex-  plicitness is startling and they may provokt  questions about erotic stereotypes of Asian  women, they are from a completely different historical and cultural context than the  other paintings in the work.  The 19th century pieces have been produced by European painters appropriating  and distorting aspects of non-European cultures, while the 16th century pieces are images of Japanese women produced by male  Japanese artists, within a specific cultural  tradition. Though there are clear similarities in how the women are portrayed, Edelstein informed me that many Shunja works  include sexual images of men.  I wanted to know more—Were these images available only to men? Were they circulated widely or only among the ruhng class?  Were they exhibited formally? When were  they first seen outside Japan? Did this tradition influence European painting?  Perhaps these images were intended to  provide a historical contrast with the contemporary images of a white woman and  Asian-Canadian woman together. But they  also introduce a level of complexity that  needs further development.  Nevertheless, "On Display" is an interesting, enjoyable and challenging work that  deals with a number of complex issues that  feminist artistic producers are currently  grapphng with. It is well worth seeing and  deserves a wider showing.  Pat Feindel is a writer, photographer  and editor.  KINESIS *SSSSSSSS**SSS^xxxx^^^  ARTS  Shining in their  simplicity, clarity  WE CALL IT HOME:  works in fabric and paper  by Sima Elizabeth Shefrin  Vancouver East Cultural Centre GaUery  July 30- August 26, 1991  by Laurel Weldon  Sometimes in the intensity of our pohtical struggles, we get lost in ideas and forget we are struggling for people. The art  of Sima Elizabeth Shefrin clearly illustrates  her commitment to reminding us about the  people.  Whether the piece is a colourful cut paper portrait or a large fabric piece, Shefrin's  art focuses on the hves of ordinary people.  In capturing a moment, her work illuminates the universal aspect of the particular  hfe she is conveying.  In her show "We Call it Home," two  cut paper pieces which I found particularly  captivating were "Portrait of my Grandmother" and "Untitled," which portrays a  man holding a boy on his lap. Coloured paper provides the main shape and contrast to  the figures, with only a few sketched hnes  providing contour and detail. The resulting  flatness is reminiscent of Fauvist artists such  as Matisse.  The show also includes four large fabric pieces of roughly the same size, hung  in a row. Three particularly attracted my  attention: "The Garment Worker I," "The  Garment Worker II," and "Woman Ironing." These pieces all depict people working  "th cloth and Shefrin achieves an interest  ing three-dimensional effect by having some  fabric hang off the piece. (In "Woman Ironing" the ironing hangs off the board.)  Shefrin's work was displayed in two recognizable sections. The pieces described  above were in the first section, and works  with a much more explicit pohtical message  filled the second section. These included depictions of Israeh and Arabic women standing side-by-side holding signs reading "Stop  the Occupation," and a piece commemorating the airlift of over 14,000 Ethiopian immigrant Jews to Israel.  Shefrin [has] skill  as a visual  storyteller.  I must confess that I lack an appreciation of art with such explicit messages. In  general, I beheve art is not a particularly  effective medium through which to convey  an argument—I've never been persuaded to  change my mind on any issue by a visual art  piece.  This is not to say that visual art has  no role in illustrating issues. In a sense,  when it comes to conveying a particular perspective, visual art faces many of the same  constraints as pohtical T-shirts. A T-shirt  serves to identify one as a proponent of a  Stop the Occupation  particular view without necessarily arguing  for that perspective. But T-shirts can make  people aware of issues that they might otherwise forget.  This analogy is certainly not meant to  denigrate art which strives to be explicitly pohtical. In Shefrin's case, some of the  pieces which are very explicitly pohtical are  skillfully crafted and visually captivating. In  particular, I thought both "Ethiopia 1958"  and "Gas Mask tests in England, Oct. 20,  1937," were fascinating in detail and composition.  However, I preferred the portraits I first  mentioned. They were more subtle and conveyed something tangible about people that  wasn't captured in the more explicit pieces.  For example, the silkscreen "Iraqi Woman  Buying Vegetables", which simply depicts  an Iraqi woman at the market, evoked the  chaos and destruction the gulf war brought  upon Iraqis. By providing an image which  contrasted so strongly with media shots of  the war-ravaged streets of Iraq, the piece  reminded me how sudden and drastic the  devastation of Iraq has been—and how it  affected the hves of ordinary people. By  contrast, the pieces which depicted women  I signs saying "Stop the Occupation"  were not as strong in bringing home the effects of the occupation.  The artist herself was surprised that I  saw such a clear division in the show. Shefrin said her intention in all the pieces was  to portray people in both the httle and the  big struggles.  One thing that is clear in all these pieces  is Shefrin's skill as a visual storyteller. The  artist describes herself as committed to feminist and multiculturalist values, and to  exploring her Jewish heritage—and she is  clearly committed to telling visual stories  which reflect these values.  Some of these pieces shine in their simplicity and clarity. Others, hke the large  fabric pieces portraying the fabric workers,  convey a quiet sense of accomplishment and  value. All these pieces are worth seeing. If  you get a chance, make a point to see the  work of Sima Elizabeth Shefrin. I think you  will find it both refreshing and thought-  provoking.  Laurel Weldon is a poet.  Chrystos:  A voice of the  colonized exiles  DREAM ON  by Chrystos  Vancouver: Press Gang, 1991  by Raj Pannu  Dream On, the second collection of  Chrystos' poetry, subverts the conventional  white male definition of poetry. To merely  define Chrystos as a Native lesbian activist  would not do justice to who she is and what  she writes about. It would be much hke pinning her words and identity under a microscope and dissecting them.  Chrystos' poetry is what poetry should  be. It comes from the heart. It is a voice of  truth which rages against ears that refuse to  hsten and a song which soothes the tears of  those who cry alone in a prison of whiteness.  This means you'll never get a chance in hell  of seeing this book being a required text for  university Enghsh hterature course.  Chrystos speaks for those of us who are  marginalized from the mainstream of Brady  Bunch society—not because we're "cool"  subversives lounging around sipping cappuccinos and quoting Marx—but because  we are victimized by the very methods  which have been employed to label, categorize, and silence us as The Other: women of  colour, lesbians, the working class. For those  of us who are imprisoned here in North  America as colonized exiles attempting to  survive against an onslaught of racism, homophobia, and classism, Chrystos' poetry  gives voice to our rage, our frustration and  our resistance to imperialist indoctrination.  Prior to "discovering" Chrystos, I held  up the dominant Eurocentric form of poetry  as a model against which to measure myself. The poetry of Chrystos has given me  a voice and has inspired me to go seek my  own vision.  Dream On, as weU as Chrystos' first collection Not Vanishing, are published by  Press Gang Pubhshers, 603 PoweU St., Vancouver B.C., V6A 1H2.  Some of Raj Pannu's poetry will be  published in the forthcoming issue of the  CapUano Review.

Her voice  holds a clear and haunting beauty. With  ease she moves from Celtic to contemporary  folk, singing with amusement and anger,  inviting her audience to join her with each  musical change and each story.  Hearing McGowan often means becoming part of her music. She stands firm and  relaxed, telling jokes and stories around her  hfe. She sings about the strength of women:  women surviving, fighting, repossessing our  power.  WeU-known within the Vancouver feminist community, McGowan deserves even  wider recognition. McGowan is a witch and  an active worker in the anti-rape movement.  ever get that homesick feehng, that longing,  longing ... ? I felt it for years. I longed for  fiddles and guitars and the way people talk  there."  In Edmonton, at the University of Alberta, she knew nobody although some of  her brothers hved nearby. McGowan was  stiU a practicing Cathohc and she joined the  folk choir at St. Joseph's CoUege.  "It was really hard for me," says McGowan. "The choir was really good and I  was this hick from New Brunswick." She  learned a lot about folk and classical music  there and started playing guitar. "The music was beautiful but there were problems.  Recently I spoke with her about the pohtical and spiritual origins of her music.  McGowan grew up in Rolhng Dam, New  Brunswick, a rural farm community. She  talks about the strength and energy of her  mother, her sisters and the women on the  local farms, who worked so hard to make  ends meet and to take care of each other.  "It seemed to me," McGowan says, "that  when I was growing up everyone in the rural maritimes was poor." The poverty had  a great pohtical impact. "There was a spirit  of survival [and] I have gained a lot of my  strength from that place."  McGowan has always sung. Her family  was musical, even though they didn't have  a record player. When she was 13 she became formaUy involved in music by joining  a Cathohc folk choir. "This really kept me  sane from when I was 13 to when I left," says  McGowan. In the choir, McGowan found a  community of women who were supportive,  and a music director who was pohticaUy  concerned: she was 'pro-life' and anti-war.  "She was, in my view then, quite a pohtical woman who sparked [pohtics] in me—  even though in a conservative way," says  McGowan. "Also, there's something about  folk music that is pohtical even if it's Christian."  At that time, McGowan hated Maritime  and Celtic music. "It was country, I thought  it was stupid," she says. But the Cathohc  choir director would often invite McGowan  to parties. "I would go to her cottage and  there would be a ho-down," says McGowan.  "People would come with their fiddles and  guitars and it was fun—and there was a lot  of drinking which I was into then. It really  came from a place of culture, that working  class maritime culture that was carried from  northern Europe. That's how I started. And  I hated it then."  McGowan was bound to leave New  Brunswick. "I didn't hke being a country  hick and when I moved I went to the prairie  where there is no ocean," she says. "Do you  This was an alternative Cathohc community  and there was all this pro-life stuff—though  there were also feminist women challenging  that. I met a lot of nuns who were doing  feminist theology."  McGowan became more and more involved with music in the nine years she  spent in Alberta. She and another woman  organized a coffee house in the basement of  the chapel where people could play any kind  of music, not just Christian folk. She began  meeting more feminist women both through  the church and, in the progressive Cathohc  tradition, by being active in the Latin  American solidarity movement. Soon McGowan connected with the women's movement and began singing at benefits, mainly  as a solo performer.  "Just before I left Edmonton, I got together aU the women I never played with,"  says McGowan. "We formed a band and  played for three weeks. We were great. Then  I left and it was over."  McGowan began moving away from the  church and discovered Starhawk, a femimst  and pohticaUy active witch from San Francisco. Her loss of faith with Catholicism related both to her growing feminist and pohtical consciousness—and to the growing  conservativeness at St. Joseph's. Says McGowan, "I wasn't interested in having my  spirituaUty separate from everything else in  my hfe."  While leaving the church was very hard,  McGowan says she has returned to her own  spiritual roots in Wicce: the rehgion of her  ancestors. To McGowan, Wicce means to  hve surrounded by the goddess. "When I  say goddess, I don't mean hke the Christian god. The goddess is hfe, that spirit,  that thing that connects us as human beings, and connects us with the animal kingdom, the plant world, with the earth. Not  disrespecting anything that is hfe."  After the transition from Christianity to  the Wiccan way of hfe, McGowan began  showing her music to people. "AU [this] af  fected the way I started writing: my pohtics  and wanting to connect [this] with spirituality and telling the truth about hfe. I think  of myself as a story teUer."  Three years ago, McGowan moved to  Vancouver. For some time after this she  was quite depressed, a depression that had  began before coming to Vancouver. She  didn't perform or write for some time,  and then gradually entered the music scene  and the women's movement, playing at the  Women's Music Festival, then at a Vancouver Lesbian Connection coffee house. She  photo courtesy Sue McGowan  Lately, her style of playing and writing  music has changed—"I just got bored," says  McGowan. She's now working more and  more with other musicians, including Carol  Weaver on percussion and Jacqui Parker-  Snedker on bass. She is also adding jazz  chords to her repertoire of Celtic, maritime  and blues sounds.  And McGowan is finding it now takes  much longer to write new songs. "I'm thinking more about what I'm writing," she says.  "It's survival. As my view of the world  changes, as my feminism develops, and since  Sue McGowan  also joined WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre.  Then her writing began again. "I'm always  amazed [at] how things come to me. I feel  so much support from the women's community."  McGowan's music is often hke a oral  history of women. "Not Only the Tale of  Montreal" relates the deaths of the 14  women at the Polytechnique to the abuse  women must survive daily. McGowan sings  the song a cappella to a strong Celtic tune.  In "Awakenings," McGowan celebrates the  summer solstice.  In an hUarious, bluesy song "New Age  Blue," McGowan sings of a woman refusing her New Age ex-partner's definitions  of where the responsibihties he in relationships. "The New Age movement has no pohtical consciousness or analysis," says McGowan. "There is so much racism inherent  in that kind of thinking, hke the 'White  Light' (to protect yourself in). The white  is the good and dark is the evil. And they  talk about choosing your own path, but you  cannot talk about creating your own reality  when we hve in a world that is misogynist  and racist and homophobic. You can't tell a  working class lesbian of colour that aU she  has to do is get it together."  McGowan also talked about the exploitation of other peoples' spirituaUty. As a  witch, she often circles with women of other  heritages. "H people want to share with me  about their culture, then I'm honoured by  that," says McGowan, "but it isn't for me to  take and then pass on to somebody else—  because it's not mine: it's not mine to give,  not mine to teach, not mine to seU."  I've come out as a lesbian and since the  war—aU that has an impact on how I write.  I feel my writing is fuUer."  "AU songs are storyteUing," says McGowan and her lyrics bear this out. Her stories come from everything around her. "I'm  inspired mostly by the women in my hfe, hke  my mother and my sister, and the women  that I knew growing up, by the women I've  worked with...[and] being a lesbian is aU  part of this too."  With her music, McGowan is "trying to  reach anyone who is willing to hsten." When  she performs, she wants her audience to participate in her music as much as possible,  and she refuses to co-opt it's meaning. "I  want to share [my message], I don't want  to mask it, I don't want to change it, and  I don't want to make it more acceptable to  anybody."  Sue McGowan's next Vancouver performance is in Random Acts' production CoUateral Damage: The Tragedy of  Medea at the Fringe Festival (see Bulletin Board for details). By next year,  she hopes to record a cassette tape of  her music.  Juline Macdonnell is a student at Simon Fraser University.

If you can, keep the length to about 500  words (if you go way over, we might  edit for space).  Hope to hear from you soon.  love,  Kinesis  Thanks for  remembering the  deadly legacy  Kinesis:  I am so pleased to see a critique of RU-  486 and contraception in the May issue  ("Stops, starts and uncertainties").  As a fertility awareness educator, teaching from a feminist perspective, I'm tired of  the mainstream press declaring these new  innovations as somehow in women's interest. Don't people remember the legacy of  Ulness and death that is created by each of  the innovations medical science offers us?  From IUD's and DES, to fetal monitoring  and hormone replacement "therapy" ...  Thanks for presenting the issues in a refreshing and critical manner ... Count me  in. Enclosed is my subscription.  Sincerely,  Lisa Leger  Toronto, Ont.  Reform Party:  humanitarian,  not sexist  Kinesis:  As an historian, I have learned that if  any idea is to be formulated into an intel-  Ugent argument, it must be supported by  the facts. In order for such an argument to  evolve, care must be taken to avoid sloppy  analysis of the facts. In her May 1991 article "The Reform Party: We're not the hfe  of this party," Karen Duthie disregards the  facts and in doing so, fails to support her notion that Canada's Reform Party is sexist.  From the hterature and medical data  written by physicians and psychologists up  untfl the mid-twentieth century—particularly in the Victorian era—many historians  have found that these doctors, not understanding the biology of the female body, often treated women in their examinations  and medical tests as the exception, rather  than the norm. In taking the male to be the  norm, many women lost their hves because  of ignorance about chUdbirth, or were institutionalized when they could have been  treated for a simple hormonal imbalance.  With regard to their lack of understanding  of female biology, the history of the medical profession has been highly censured,, and  rightly so.  Yet ironically, many decades later, when  people now understand such things as the  menstrual cycle and regard it to be something natural and healthy, Duthie's article suggests that same misguided perception  that somehow women are "non-people." Her  main criticism of the RPC is that Reformers  are "not so much interested in 'women's issues' as they are in 'people's issues'." Since  when are women "non-people?" The word  'people' refers to a collective group of individual human beings. To say that women  do not form part of this group—as Duthie  implies—is to argue that women are either subhuman or superhuman. Since Karen  Duthie faUs to convince us that women are  something other than human, I can only  conclude that she also faUs to prove that the  Reform Party is anti-women in its pohcy of  being "for the people."  Duthie incorrectly writes that women's  rights wUl go unheeded if the Reform Party  becomes our federal government. On the  contrary, if the Reform Party does form  a government, women's issues along with  other humanitarian issues, wUl be dealt  with since women are people. According  to its own statement of principles, the  RPC beheves that "every individual, group,  province, and region in Canada is entitled  to fundamental justice ..." (p. 26).  Duthie need not be concerned that social  services will be abolished under the Reform  Party, for such fear is totally unfounded.  The RPC's platform states that the party  "beUeves in public services—that governments, civU servants, poUticians, and poUtical parties exist to serve the people, and  that they should demonstrate this service  commitment at aU times" (p. 27).  One way in which responsible governments can demonstrate their commitment  to the people is through public services  which do not run deficits. Through their  Tax Freedom Day this year, the Fraser Institute reported that whUe taxation over the  last two decades has risen to a point where  it gobbles up 5 percent of Canadians' incomes, the quality of our social services has  not increased. The RPC beUeves in public  services so long as the governments providing such services can afford them. To date,  governments have used deficit financing to  pay for these services in order to "bribe"  Canadian voters; this includes appealing to  groups that lobby for women's rights. While  taxpayers feel they are getting a lot of services for not very much, in the long run,  the people wfll have to pay for these services at a much higher real cost due to high  interest rates. Every Canadian should be  concerned with the federal Tory and Liberal governments who have so far accumulated enough debt to make every Canadian $16,000 poorer. The Reform Party of  Canada makes this deficit its primary concern, and for doing so, it is wrongfully accused by the other federal parties and interest groups alike of being sexist.  It makes httle sense that anyone should  fault the Reform party for regarding women  and men as equal. The Reform Party's platform considers everyone equal—regardless  of ethnicity, class, age, education, and  gender—and does not attempt to create differences between men and women which do  not exist. When a party recognizes that aU  individuals are people, there is no need to  make separate laws for men and separate  laws for women. Isn't the role of government  'for the people, by the people?'  As one who strongly advocates feminism  and equahty amongst both men and women,  I find it rather offensive that so much misinformation and rhetoric has been used to  unjustly discredit the Reform Party. Re  formers beheve in reform for all, especially  for government; so why should the Reform  Party be labeUed sexist?  Sincerely,  CoUeen Doty,  Surrey, B.C.  Heterosexual  reader appreciates  "Sexplorations"  Kinesis:  Two letters in the July/August issue  question the "Sexplorations" article in the  preceding issue. They gave me pause for  thought. Olive Johnson says the article is "a  bit much" and that she doubts you'd "devote that much space to the joys of married  sex." The Scarborough Board of Education  feels that the article did not promote "positive attitudes towards women."  As a heterosexual woman I appreciate  "Sexplorations." I thought the comments  were courageous and the photographs were  beautiful. I felt that the writers were speaking for aU of us, not just for lesbians. Bet Cecil says, "Sex is scary territory and discussions have often been painful and polarized.  Our natural sexuahty has been taken away  from most of us." Do these comments not  apply to most heterosexual women too? I  am learning, in the pages of Kinesis, that it  is lesbians (perhaps because they have been  forced to be courageous about their sexuality) who are the most wUhng to take on this  difficult, but important subject!  For a number of years I have toyed with  the idea of writing a kind of erotica that  hberated heterosexual women can relate to.  I've had great difficulty with this. Though  I enjoy sex, it is, indeed, a "scary subject" and every time I attempt to write  erotica that does not demean women I feel  paralyzed by the enormity of the cultural  taboo I am breaking! It is bad enough when  mainstream society says, "Women must not  write about their sexuahty." When those  who identify as feminist do so too, it is always disappointing and inhibiting.  Sincerely,  Anne Miles,  Gibsons, B.C.  Silencing lesbians  affects all  women's  struggles  Kinesis:  I am writing in response to Ohve Johnson's letter (July/August, 1991). As an  open lesbian, I take issue with Ms. Johnson's inquiry as to why it is necessary to  write about lesbians. Ms. Johnson claims  QRiVEDESiGN  DESKTOP   PUBLISHING  periodicals     **   catalogues  newsletters      ads        programs  customized graphics  i        SLIDIWCiSCALE  |     Deborah Kirkland 253-5109  that since not all lesbians are feminists, Kinesis should not write so much about us.  Not aU women are feminists either, yet we  struggle on to gain a voice for all women,  feminist or not. For years women have  struggled against sUence, trying to make our  voices heard in society, in the pohtical and  legal forums, and in our families. Lesbians  are also struggling to gain a voice, often  without the support of the "feminist" community.  I do not beheve that Ms. Johnson can  be "in complete sympathy with the needs  and rights of lesbians" and at the same  time want to exclude the discussion of those  rights, and the celebration of lesbian culture  from the paper.  While Ms. Johnson requests that Kinesis should inform the entire feminist spectrum, she faUs to seek out and understand  the connection between the oppression of  lesbians and the oppression of women.  Lesbians have been persecuted throughout history due to society's perception of  our sexual behaviour as "unnatural." The  reasons for our persecution run much deeper  than that. Lesbians refuse to conform to social mores which dictate that as women, we  must need men, sexuaUy and sociaUy. We  pose a threat to the very fabric of society,  the socially and legaUy constructed family.  All women have struggled against the patriarchal definition of family. Lesbian struggles  strike at the very bases of patriarchal famUy and social structures. Silencing lesbians  wUl affect aU women's struggle to free ourselves from patriarchally prescribed sexual  and social mores.  Yes, it is important to say who is an  "open lesbian." It is crucial that we celebrate our openness. Ms. Johnson would  deny lesbians the right to have a community by denying us the right to say proudly  that we are lesbians.  Many women in the feminist movement  deny lesbians our right to be proud of our  heritage, our strength, our voice. Many of  you claim that it is all right to be a lesbian, just don't "shove it down my throat."  Heterosexuality has been shoved down my  throat since the first day I began to think  as a woman, as a human being. Not being  able to have lesbian role models (or even to  hear the word "lesbian" uttered as a positive word, not an insult) denied me the right  to as happy and fulfilled a sexual and social  growth as heterosexuals, Uke Ms. Johnson.  I urge Kinesis to continue to print the  word lesbian, to help us celebrate our community, to show respect for our struggle to  find a voice. Although we may not aU be  feminists, we are aU women ... and all part  of the feminist spectrum.  Sincerely,  AlUson Bond  Victoria, B.C.  m     CARDS*  l/^RECOROS  .KINESIS LETTERS  x2**m*^*#^#^^%^#  Differentiating  between sex  and sexuality  Kinesis:  Re: the letter from OUve Johnson  (July/August 1991).  Thank you Ms. Johnson! You expressed  so weU what I have been agonizing over, for  fear of being accused of being homophobic,  ever since I received my June issue of Kinesis. So often I have applauded the weU-  written and interesting articles, only to be  slapped with what I see as another indication of society's inabUity to differentiate  between sex and sexuahty. I feel that it is  this attitude that only increases violence towards women and chUdren and is every bit  as dangerous whether focused on heterosexuals or homosexuals. I might further add to  Ms. Johnson's comments "... but being a  lesbian is certainly no guarantee of being a  feminist" by stating nor is being a feminist  an indicator of being a lesbian.  Please take some of Ms. Johnson's suggestions seriously and consider her comments on the focus of your paper. Even  though I Uve a considerable distance, not  only in miles but culture, from the Greater  Vancouver area, so many of your feminist issues know no cultural or geographic  boundaries and I would hate to cancel an  otherwise interesting and informative paper.  Sincerely,  Cathryn Craik  Fort Smith, NWT.  Since when is  10 percent a  general slant?  Kinesis:  I think the headhne you wrote for Carole Perz's letter (July/August 1991) was  inaccurate and unfair ("Homophobia in  Scarborough, Ont.") Phobias are persistent  fears that are unwarranted or irrational. It  is not irrational for an employee of the Scarborough Board of Education to distance  herself from graphic portrayals of sexual  acts, regardless of the gender(s) portrayed.  That distance is what our society demands  of educators. If she doesn't, she risks losing  her job and/or her reputation. The wording of her letter is very clear on this point  and commendably non-judgmental: "...  explicit photography is inappropriate in our  organization ... "I beheve you owe her an  apology.  Olive Johnson's letter, however, is another matter. Her assessment that the paper's "general slant" and "focus" is "lesbianism" is both unwarranted and irrational.  It was tedious, but I went through a  bunch of old issues and counted column  inches. I came up with approximately 10  percent lesbian content when I discounted  covers, tables of contents and classifieds  (that figure would be even smaUer if I  didn't). Last time I heard, 10 percent also  happens to be a conservative estimate of the  number of homosexuals in the general population. I, for one, think it's phobic to imagine that 10 percent could define the general  slant or focus of anything.  In order for a phobia to persist, information which contradicts the phobia must  be denied. The resulting voice fiUs up with  hes, half-truths and irrelevant information.  When people who see themselves as open-  minded and rational attempt to convince  others of their phobic views, they usuaUy  give voice to their half-truths and irrelevan-  cies. Lies might be recognized for what they  are but their other justifications might escape detection. Undetected, they cloud the  issue as Ms. Johnson does when she writes:  "... being a lesbian is certainly no guarantee of being a femimst ..."  Kinesis is not about feminists; the paper's sub-title is "News About Women  That's Not In The Dailies." News about  women, however, is of special interest to  feminists. For example, women workers  don't have to be feminists for feminists to  care about their working conditions. It does  not seem to me that Ms. Johnson is " ...  in complete sympathy with the needs and  rights of lesbians ..." when she is opposed  to Kinesis publishing the realities of our  hving conditions. I beheve her statement of  solidarity is an insult to the real allies we  have within the heterosexual femimst community.  Ms. Johnson would rather Kinesis publish "more discussion of legal issues." I  hve in SE Asia but by reading Kinesis I  know about the important "Rape Shield  Law" challenge before the Supreme Court of  Canada (May 1991), the favorable ruhng of  UPRISING BREADS  BAKERY  Makers of Vancouver's Finest  Whole Grain Breads  Whole Wheat, Whole Wheat Unsalted (Tues. & Thurs.  only), Cracked Wheat and Sunflower, Seven Grain,  Sourdough Light Rye, Finnish Whole Grain,  Sourdough Pumperknickel (yeast free), Whole Wheat  Raisin (Wed., Fri., & Sat. only), Folk Bread (Fri. &  Sat.)

Only in the Theatre  Appearing at the Vancouver Fringe Festival is Twice Over, the story of a young  woman who discovers her grandmother was a lesbian. (Pictured above are, left  to right, Lovie Eli, Rosie Frier-Dryden, Sandra P. Grant and Celine Lockhart.)  Written by Black British playwright Jackie Kay, Twice Over explores the pain of  living a lie, and offers an honest portrayal of love between two older women.

'  that same Court after it heard opposing arguments from REAL Women and LEAF in  the SuUivan/LeMay case (AprU 1991), the  43-43 tie on BiU C-43 in the Senate (March  1991), etc ... Every month the women at  Kinesis must read a fantastic amount of legal gobbledygook, and translate it besides,  because aU my issues of Kinesis have lots  of articles in plain Enghsh on court ruling, pending legislation, government budgets and policy. I resent this and similar remarks of Ms. Johnson's as they contradict  the efforts and results of the workers at Kinesis.  I'm tempted to continue to go through  Ms. Johnson's letter point-by-point and my  back issues month-by-month to Ulustrate  the fact that Kinesis is already publishing  what Ms. Johnson is now advising they publish. This letter, however, probably exceeds  the recommended length so I'U go to my  remaining points. I've posed them as questions to Ms. Johnson but I beheve the feminist community at large would benefit if we  each asked ourselves:  1. Do you read aU of Kinesis or only  the lesbian bits? (Note: Substitute for the  word 'lesbian' any group that you feel for  or against.)  2. Do you take the time to give credit to  the women who work hard to keep us better  informed than the mainstream media does  on women's issues?  3. Do your criticisms accurately reflect  that to which you object or do you disguise them to shield yourself from counter-  criticism?  4. Do you agree with the decision to publish the text of "Sexplorations" in Kinesis'!  5. Do you agree with the decision to publish the accompanying photographs?  6. When you answered ques. 4 and 5, did  you also think through an analysis of your  response? Did you settle for justifications  comprised of half-truths and irrelevancies?  7. Would you answer ques. 4,5, or 6 differently if "Sexplorations" had focussed on  heterosexual sex?  8. Last, but not least, how do you differentiate photos of "married sex" from photos of "unmarried sex?"  I, myself, do not agree with the decision  to publish the photos in Kinesis. Viewing  sexuaUy explicit photographs could be con-  sidered.a sexual act. As the readers of Kinesis didn't expect to find such photos within  its pages, it's incorrect to assume that they  had given consent to view them. It could  be argued, therefore, that some readers had  participated in a sexual act to which they  had not consented.  I would not make the same argument  against pubhcation of the text. Although  reading sexuaUy expUcit writing may also  be a sexual act, the effort one puts into doing it would seem to indicate consent. Reading is both a conscious and time-consuming  act, whereas viewing a graphic image is automatic and instantaneous.  I want to make it clear that I am not talking about censorship or pornography. Were  the photos to appear in a publication whose  readership could anticipate coming across  them, I would defend their publication.  I hope I would make the same analysis  had the focus been heterosexual.  With the exception of question 8, I remain sincerely ...  Alleson Kase  Amphor Sansai, ThaUand  Lesbianism a  core issue  for all feminists  Kinesis:  I was sorry to see that the lesbian content of the June issue raised some fears for  a few heterosexual women. Lesbianism is a  really core issue for aU feminists because,  hke nothing else, it challenges the dominant  role that men stiU play in our society.  As a lesbian myself, I welcome the respect  and support I have received from heterosexual women around my sexuahty, and I hope  I can continue to count on it in the future.  Sincerely,  Sima Elizabeth Shefrin,  Vancouver, B.C.  See LETTERS page 20  KINESIS ^^vS^^^^^^^i^^^^  Letters  LETTERS fronvpage 19  Shut up  and listen  for a change  Kinesis:  This is getting boring. In the July/August issue of Kinesis two of us from BOA  [Bevy of Anarcha-feminists] productions  wrote a letter about classism. The letter  was edited by Kinesis. Kinesis editorial  board also wrote their own letter. This letter made BOA look hke we skulk around in  dark doorways hurhng "personal attacks,"  whUe "poor" hapless Kinesis stood firm as  saints. Pyuuie! Anybody could smeU a rat  there.  For the record: Classism is an ongoing attack on, and discrimination against, low income and working class people because of  middle/upper class (internalized/intentional) assumptions about "lower" class people.  BOA is a loose group of wimmin with httle  or no access to resources (ie., money, funding, presses, materials). We make magazines  and put on cultural events with each other's  help.  BOA and the wimmin who help with  BOA have been misrepresented in Kinesis  since AprU, 1991. We were also treated with  disdain and disrespect. We figured that no  one would intentionaUy mistreat people hke  this. It must be a hidden bigotry. It was.  It was classism. In our letter last issue, we  named how we were treated, we named it  as classism. Kinesis caUed it "personal attacks," and edited anything in the letter  that was a description of Kinesis's classism.  Triviahzing and twisting our arguments  against us to make it look hke we were  the offenders (ie., "personal attacks") is  the worst kind of sophistry. That kind of  sophist-ication takes a real special kind of  class-lessness. A triple whammy of blaming  the victim, kiUing the messenger, and stabbing us with kid gloves.  WeU we can't afford kid gloves, but if  we been stabbed by a pair of yours, we'll  let you know it. We call a spade a spade  and don't wrap it in kid gloves. We are not  your grovelling whining begging for your  approval/authority hanging on your every  word kind of gals. A httle ribaldry wit and  out-rage—and oops! our class is showing.  But not to "personaUy attack" anybody.  In other words, when we say, "we've been  insulted and treated with venom and disdain" by Kinesis, we mean it. This ain't  no personal attack this is what happened to  us! Not the other way around. Nothing personal, it's a class issue! We honestly think  we would have been treated differently if we  had more prestige and privUege! We have  been trying to explain this to Kinesis, and  somehow it just doesn't get heard.  Kinesis even said 'it' wanted to discuss  the issues of classism with us in the future,  and then went right ahead, edited our letter and slandered us publicly in the last issue. Does this sound hke good faith to you,  dear reader? (This letter too wUl probably  be edited.) [Ed. note: Nope.]  I know what you are thinking. You're  thinking that BOA has a stick up its butt.  I mean, some of Kinesis' best friends are  poor, right? WeU, even poor people can have  internalized classism. I know I do! Having  come from the middle class more than half  a hfe time ago, I have the double vision of  knowing the biases inside and out. So I have  to look at what is classist about my thinking/and behaviour and try to change that.  Beheve me, the longer I am poor, and work  with low income people, the easier it is to  see and identify classism. I have to examine  both my privUeges and my oppressions. Sort  it out. That's what I'm asking of Kinesis.  Secondly, we were accused of "personaUy attacking" a reviewer who wrote a clas  sist review in Kinesis about a BOA cultural/community event. Not true. BOA debunked the trumped up speculations in the  review, and explained "ideas," hke community and culture. Kinesis called these "personal attacks." There was so much buUying  about how we should discuss in our issue,  we felt impeUed to puU the article. Middle  class values cannot define this issue for us.  Dig?  Because of aU of this, readers were denied the chance to read a great article about  BOA. BOA and the readers lose here. Honest, BOA prefers to be proactive not reac-  tively having to wipe muck that's been slung  from another press.  Thirdly, Kinesis claimed that women  from BOA wanted to write about "ourselves." Trivialization is classist. ActuaUy,  we wanted to write about BOA: an explosive timeless socio-political phenomenon.  Fourthly, the entire process of dealing  with Kinesis has been brutal and painful.  BOA raised the issue of classism because  we were affected by it at Kinesis. Classism  hurts and it is not smart. We raised the issue in good faith, but every time we try to  move forward with Kinesis, we get slam-  dunked. I don't get it. Kinesis is no more  the cause of classism than BOA are the only  wimmin affected by it! KiUing the messenger and blaming the victim has never been  an effective means of dealing with the message. So let's get on with it.  How can Kinesis deal with and do something to fight classism? For starters, shutup  and hsten for a change. Would you doubt  a lawyer about the law? Then don't doubt  low income wimmin about what classism is.  Acknowledge that classism exists and is a  problem. Acknowledge that taking direction  from low income people is really difficult for  middle class people to do. Why? Because  middle class people know how to do everything better, right? Middle class guUt and  defensiveness is useless. Looking at what  privUeges you have and sharing them to  make more space for wimmin is revolutionary. Take heed, don't tell people how to define themselves.  Invite low income and working class wimmin to write about and discuss classism. Do  a series in Kinesis on classism. Get lots  of different low income wimmin—wimmin  who have been poor aU their hves; half their  hves; for centuries; from various cultures  and sexual identities and abihties; wimmin who were poor and are no longer, etc.  "Inter-class travel" affects how we identify  ourselves, too. Class issues are confusing.  Only writing, talking, hstening wUl help us  all get clear on this stuff.  Classism is the most divisive issue among  wimmin today. Classism affects how we  value each other, ourselves, our bodies, our  intelligence, and our aesthetic. As the corporate agenda leaves less to go around, people wiU chng to what privUeges they have.  This will divide us further. We have to  guard against this.  rvswi  The Vancouver Status of Women's  AGM will feature an opportunity for  members to discuss VSWs work In  the community.

Tel: 255-5511  One hundred percent of wimmin are in  the only class that counts: have nots. Yet  classist values are so strong that many wimmin consciously and subconsciously identify  with the haves. By denying our internalized classism, we further oppress each other.  Without dealing with classism, we cannot  seriously deal with any other form of oppression, because they are aU intrinsicaUy  related to class.  Do we want to unconsciously help buUd  an even bigger underclass of wimmin cleaning professional wimmin's toUet bowls? Do  we want to have a feminist movement that  is only for a few wimmin and not for others?  Or do we want low income wimmin to help  set the "feminist agenda?" Did we lose the  wimmin, hberation, and movement when  the wimmin's hberation movement became  feminism? Let's put it aU back in there ...  As one woman I talked to about this issue said, "It is harder to come out as poor  or working class in the feminist movement  than it is to come out as lesbian." Don't  push us back into the closet.  And don't slag BOA. It only exacerbates the problem. Kinesis is an important  part of the dialogue for and by wimmin.  So is BOA. The only enemy is the patriarchy/corporate agenda and it dearly needs  classism to survive,  p.j. flaming, supported by  Kim Jackson  Some people  just want to  make trouble  Kinesis:  "Whaddya mean they didn't hke the  BOA show? Who is this Kinesis anyway?  Here [handing me a pen] write me a letter;  write down what I say, cuz I can't read and  write."  I enjoyed the BOA show. What did they  [the reviewer] want? Someone to run around  in their underwear? What's wrong with  them? I enjoyed it. Frankie enjoyed it. And  so did her daughter. I sure laughed a lot  opening night. I hked the art on the walls [of  the Downtown Eastside Women's Centre].  It was different. And I use the Centre every  day. I better hke it—I even clean in here  on the weekends when it's closed up.
