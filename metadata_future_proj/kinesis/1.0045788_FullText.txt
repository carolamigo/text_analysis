ISSN 0317-9095  Second class mail #6426 A funny thing happened on our way to press—actually, lots of not so funny things too.  News we felt Kinesis should be covering broke almost daily: 'rumours' of the juicy  kind—the kind Kinesis readers (and the Ed Board) love to hear; connections to be made  between the major and not so major news stories in the dailies; boycotts, demonstrations,  public meetings and much, much more.  But the paper was full and Kinesis writers were already out there digging up stories.  And, heck, we didn't know who to lobby for that 72-hour day, anyway. So we came up with  this column to fill you in on what women are talking about as Kinesis goes to press. PS.  We're writing this on press night so please forgive the typos, grammar, et cetera  First up's the constitutional accordi If you didn't know a 'yes/no' referendum on the  deal is set for October 26, you're not the only one. A lot of us have turned off hearing  about this stuff. Even at Kinesis, we've had a hard time making constitution stories interesting. That's 'cos women's groups have been saying the same thing all along—we want  in or we won't go along with their deal.  Well, the deal's down to a yes or no, and NAC's come out and said it for about 580  women's organizations across the country [See NAC interviews, pages 11-13]. There's  never been a better time for getting involved—chances are, if women vote No, the government's going to learn they will never get away with ignoring women again.  About 300 women showed up for a public meeting in Vancouver with NAC's Judy Rebick and Shelagh Day on September 20 to find out why NAC said No. They were also  there to hear NWAC's Barbara Wyss speak on why the Native Women's Association  of Canada wants the referendum process stopped [See page 3]. Last we heard, they  had a hearing for their injunction with a federal court of appeal on September 22.  Oh, and did you hear about the 'phone call Quebec's largest women's group got from  the chief of staff to the Secretary of State on September 9? Seems SecState is worried  about funding women's groups on the no-side of the constitutional question. Well,  were they miffed when they found out the Quebec Federation of Women taped the conversation. It hit the dailies a week later and, the next day, the QFW got their cheque from  SecState, with comment about there being a "misunderstanding.''  Judy Rebick told us the other day that NAC also received a call from SecState saying  they wanted to review NAC's file, "which is very unusual," says Rebick. So unusual, they  never thought to tape the call.  NAC's Yes-to-Equality, No-to-the-Accord events to watch for are simultaneous  demonstrations across the country on the day the Court Challenges program is scrapped—  September 30—and on or around Person's Day—October 18 [See Bulletin Board]. Person's Day, by the way, refers to the day women won the right to be considered "persons"—  just 63 years ago. And October is Women's History Month [See Bulletin Board for  events].  Speaking of history, while the country was busy worrying about how to answer on October 26, the House of Commons scrapped the family allowance program—the first universal social program in Canadian history, when they were established in 1945. The last of  the cheques, also known as the baby bonus, will be mailed out in December. They're being  replaced with a child tax benefit cheque. We'll have more about this in our November issue.  The proposed North American Free Trade (NAFTA) deal also slid by many of us. Or  at least, we didn't get to hear much about the connections between the constitutional deal  and NAFTA. We'll tell you more about it in the next Kinesis centre spread. Also, read  our article on Maquiladoras on page 8. If you can't wait for the next issue or want to get  involved, go to the next Woman to Woman Global Strategies meeting on October 7 at  7:30 pm at the Phihppine Women's Centre, 5889 Lanark St, Vancouver. Also, there'll be  a demonstration at the border on October 18 [See Bulletin Board for details.].  We didn't make it to a demonstration held on September 21 at Canada Place to 'welcome' Brian Mulroney to Vancouver (we were busy going to press) so we don't know how  many people showed. The Citizens Against Free Trade organised the demo to show their  "dislike" for NAFTA and the constitutional accord.  ^Thanks  Our thanks to Vancouver Status of Women members who support us year 'round with  memberships and donations.

Also on page 5,  in "Copping out on Protection," 'Karin  Mladovic' should have read Kairn Mladenovic of Prostitutes and Other Women for  Equal Rights (POWER) and by 'Regina  Louvek,' we really meant Regina Lorek of  Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter. Our apologies—we promise not to do  this again. The acronym NOIVM in "Some  things never change" on page 3 stands for:  National Organization of Immigrant and  Visible Minority Women. Credit for the  painting on page 16 in the review, "Putting  ourselves in the picture," belongs to Suzo  (not Susan) Hickey. Oh, and way back in  June, we misspelled Sharlein Smith's name  in "Campus violence: She's Not a Victim."  We've got to go now—we're late for proof-  raeding skool.  There was another demo the night before: a number of groups protested Bill C-86—the  new immigration bill. About 400 people showed up. We'll have a long-overdue story on  what's so bad about the new immigration bill in our next issue.  By now, you've probably heard about London Drugs' new baby-formula marketing campaign. H you're a new mom and you haven't, here's the scoop: run, don't walk, to your  local LD. They've got a 'free gift' that includes a baby formula sample, formula information and a formula company-produced video on "breastfeeding." Guess the formula company bigwigs figured they'd switch tactics on formula marketing after they lost the support of the health care industry. Never mind that this also contravenes the World Health  Organization's (WHO) code for marketing of breast milk substitutes.  Anyway, breastfeeding advocates, and in particular, the BC Breastfeeding Coalition, are  calling for a boycott of London Drugs until all formula promotions from LD store are  pulled and LD promises to comply with the WHO code in future.  Oh, and before we forget, we overheard someone from a Vancouver women's group talk  about applying for 'Stopping the Violence' campaign funding (the BC Ministry of Women's  Equahty response to last year's task force report on family violence). Anyway, they want  the money to launch a self-help plan to arm women across Canada with cast-iron frying  pans to actively combat violence against women. We think it's a great idea 'cos it also promotes 'family values'—we'll be able to cook with them when we're not protecting ourselves.  Speaking of family values, OutRights/Les Droits Visibles is on this month and we're  expecting the conference to be pretty interesting [read our preview on page 9].  We heard Little Sister's court case against Canada Customs' censorship of lesbian and  gay erotica won't be going to trial on September 28 as planned. Vancouver's lesbian and  gay bookstore was told there's a backlog of judges so they'll have to wait— again. It's not  the first time Little Sister's case has been held up—it's cost them $100,000 and the filed  the case three years ago. Enough already.  Wait a minute—Little Sis Janine. Fuller tells us they still get to be in court on Sep 28.  Seems they have a judge for a quick attempt by the defence—Canada Customs—to try to  get the case thrown out. Fuller says they'll hang on as long as it takes. "Someone's got to  stop homophobia at Canada Customs from running rampant.  On the entertainment scene for all you OutRights gals: there are three dyke films at  this year's Vancouver International Film Fest. The NFB Studio D's Forbidden Love is one  [See Bulletin Board]. You'll have to guess the other two 'cos we don't know. But what  we have heard from women who crashed the festival's press screenings is that Women in  the Shadows is a must-see.  Also, don't miss Video In's night of lesbian and gay videos and the Body Project  events put on by Basic Inquiry Studio. [See Bulletin Board].  And, in the next issue, we'll have reviews of documentary films on women's issues by  South Asian filmmaker Deepa Dhanraj that are playing as Kinesis goes to press. They're  being put on by Cineworks Independent Filmmakers' Society at the Pacifique Cinematheque.  By the way, if you're wondering why we haven't talked about the Senate gender-parity  deal five provinces are proposing if the constitutional accord gets a Yes, we're sick of the  backlash out there. Besides, the dailies are full of it and we had better things to do anyway. Like going to press.  •58s^$fe&Sw£  Inside  Kinesis  This must be a first for Inside Kinesis this  year—no goodbyes, just a few hellos, which  always makes us happy.  Greetings to first-time writers: Hella Lee,  Seema Ahluwalia, Manisha Singh, Smita  Patil, Penny MacPherson and Rosanne  Johnson.  Hello also to first-time production volunteers: we're talking about the gals who  proofread, juggled exacto-knives and wrestled with the waxer; answered the Kinesis phone hnes when things got too hectic,  called couriers, ran out for pizza, and hstened to production coordinator Anne Jew's  bad jokes. New on the crew were: Olivia Anderson, Karen Atnlin, Kim Sorensen.  As you may have noticed, right 'next  door' to Inside Kinesis, we have a new regular feature—a column called "As Kinesis  Goes to Press." This is a chance for our 'underworked' editor to keep you as up to date  as possible. Actually, we beheve it's necessary because we sometimes don't have the  time or the bodies to cover some stories, especially those that break as Kinesis goes to  press. Please let us know what you think or  send us information about things that are  happening towards the last weekend of every month.  Other news around Kinesis: we held our  first roofpreading [proofreading?] workshop  this production. Many thanks to Frances  Wallerslein [Wasserlein?] for training volunteers. If you notice any typos or other proofreading errors, maybe it's time you joined  the ranks of Kinesis proofreaders. Call production coordinator Anne Jew at 255-5499.  Also, we're starting to get the hang of our  new computer program, Pagemaker. We've  tried it out on Bulletin Board this  can you spot the difference?  Finally, our next issue will mark the  sixth-year anniversary of the last redesign  of Kinesis—we thought it would be an appropriate issue for us to launch our much  promised new, improved look for Kinesis.  Stay tuned.  J  KINESIS //////////////////////////////////////////////v  /////////////////////////^^^^  ///////////////////////////^^^  'n  News  Canadian constitutional accord:  BC women say 'No way'  by Jackie Brown  With the constitutional referendum just  weeks away, the Tory government's Yes men  have swung into high gear with a flag-  waving propaganda campaign that includes  local and regional 'Yes' committees. A No  vote, warns Prime Minister Mulroney, is a  vote against Canada that could well tear the  country apart.  Despite the government's appeal to 'patriotism', numerous organizations, including B.C. women's and anti-poverty groups,  are voicing dissent over a deal they beheve  will be disastrous for poor people, women,  racial minorities, Aboriginal women, people  with disabihties and lesbians and gays.  Leading the way is the Native Women's  Association of Canada (NWAC), which has  filed for an injunction with a federal appeal  court to (1) stop constitutional talks with  Aboriginal groups and (2) the October 26  constitutional referendum.  Last month, the federal Court of Appeal  ruled that NWAC's rights to free speech had  been violated by the federal government's  refusal to give them a seat at the constitutional talks. [See Kinesis, Sep 92.]  According to NWAC's Sharon Mclvor,  the government's refusal to respond to  the Court of Appeal decision prompted  NWAC's action. Says Mclvor: "We got our  decision, which said our rights had been  violated. The federal government has not  stopped violating our rights so we have to  do whatever we can to get our voices included. "  "We are asking for an injunction to stop  constitutional talks with Aboriginal organizations and the referendum itself until the  federal government includes us in the constitutional process." The court will hear  NWAC's arguments on September 22.  Mclvor says Aboriginal women's rights  are not protected under Native self-government provisions in the proposed constitution because Native governments are not  bound to equahty rights guarantees for Aboriginal.  Child support payments:  "Native self-governments can opt out of  virtually all of the Charter by using the  notwithstanding (section 33) clause and  we know there are several self-government  plans that include opting out right away."  That will leave Native women on their  own, she says, because they cannot challenge a Native government violation of their  Charter rights through the Human Rights  Act since it specifically excludes Natives.  Mclvor says NWAC feels "pretty abandoned by the whole bunch of them", including Aboriginal organizations that have not  dealt adequately with NWAC's concerns  about violence against women and children  in Native communities.  Mclvor points out "there is physical and  psychological abuse and a lot is by the  people in power. We need gender equahty  so that we can have a voice in the self-  government negotiations that are going to  take place so that we are not ridden rough  shod over."  And NWAC is not the only group with  doubts about the deal, she adds, noting the  growing concern among many Native bands.  Also opposing the accord as it now stands  is the South Asian Women's Action Network (SAWAN), which says the deal threatens the rights of racial minority women.  "We have been completely left out of the  process," says SAWAN's Sunera Thobani.  "The rights language is so watered down  it's meaningless and other parts of this.deal  are very damaging to racial minority women  and especially immigrant women."  She notes, for example, that devolution of  powers to the provinces in key pohcy areas  hke immigration and labour market training will have an extremely negative impact.  "The new federal immigration legislation is  already trying to get people to hve in specific areas of the country. [This means] they  could be trapped in a province with pohcies  that don't protect their rights, keep them in  the lowest waged work, don't provide ade-  . quate job training and ESL programs, and  won't allow them to bring their families into  the country."  And devolution, together with the provision for provinces to opt out of national social programs, will also mean a fragmentation of health, education, social services and  other national initiatives, says Thobani.  "Those at the bottom of the economy  will be the hardest hit. As far as we're concerned, we want more discussion before the  referendum and we're saying let's not take  it for granted that this is a done deal. There  have to be changes or else the only vote is  No. We might not win this but we need to  go down fighting," she adds.  Ask Joan Meister of the Disabled Women's Action Network (DAWN) what she  thinks of the deal and her answer is to the  point: "I have two good reasons for voting No," says the former chair of DAWN  Canada. "I'm a woman and I have a disabihty. It's interesting that the end of April  marked the end of the Decade of the Disabled Person. It doesn't take long for governments to forget you when you're no  longer the 'flavour of the month'."  Like SAWAN's Thobani, Meister thinks  the 'rights' language in the new deal is useless because the Canada Clause does not  name people with disabihties nor does it  commit the federal and provincial governments to protect disabled rights [see story,  page 12].  "I don't caxe if Joe Blow down the road  thinks the language includes me. I want my  governments to commit themselves to the  equahty of women and women with disabilities," says Meister.  Mary Rowles, director of women's pro-  grains at the BC Federation of Labour, says  labour women in BC also have concerns  with regards to the rights of women, racial  minorities, poor people and lesbians and  gays, and are worried about the impact of  the deal on national social programs. The  Federation's women's committee has and  will continue to discuss ramifications of the  deal, she says.  Sexist tax strikes again  by Mijin Kim  A Quebec woman's challenge of a sexist taxation pohcy has been overturned by  a Quebec Tax Court. Suzanne Thibodeau,  a single mother, took Revenue Canada to  court for descriminating against her because  her child support payments were taxed [See  Kinesis, April 1992].  The Revenue Canada pohcy taxes those  who receive child support payments—  usually women—and gives tax benefits to  those  who  make  the  payments—usually  Thibodeau, who was asked to pay $4,260  in unpaid taxes on $14,490 in child support payments made by her former partner  in 1989, argued that the child support payments were for her children and not for her-  sell As such, she should not have to include  them as part of her taxable income.  Thibodeau also argued that, since it is  mostly women who receive child support  payments, the current law is a violation  against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms  which protects against sexual discrimination.  In making his ruhng, Judge Alban Garon  said that because the the court that set  the amount of child support payments took  into consideration the taxation impact of  the payments on the Thibodeau, she did  not "suffer prejudice." The judge also ruled  that Revenue Canada does not discriminate  against women or any recipients of child  support payments.  A tax system which allows one parent  to deduct the support payments they make  from their taxable income and insists that  the parent receiving the money include it in  theirs is not discriminatory, the judge ruled.  However, the judge said, if the court had  not taken the impact of taxes on payments  into count at the time of settling amounts,  "the party concerned should exercise their  right of appeal to correct the situation."  On the heels of this decision, a BC woman  has launched a challenge against the discriminatory tax laws in a case representative of most single mothers who receive child  support payments. The case is set to be  heard by the Tax Court of Canada later this  month or early in November.  Brenda Shaft, a single mother of two children hving in Vancouver, is appealing Revenue Canada's order to pay taxes on child  support payments she received in 1990. It  was the first year since leaving her husband  that she had been employed fulltime. However, at the time of setting support payments at $300 a month, Shaft had been  on social assistance. Social assistance is not  taxable so the tax impUcations of the settlement were never taken into account.  In the meantime, Rowles will voice labour  women's concerns at the upcoming meeting  of the Canadian Labour Congress, which  has endorsed the accord. "I personally do  not think it's too late to get changes to the  package."  Describing the proposed deal as part of  a corporate, free trade agenda that undermines the rights of poor people, women,  and minority groups, Pam Flemming of End  Legislated Poverty (ELP) says it gives the  federal government another means of "chiseling away" at existing social programs and  threatens the establishment of new ones.  "Really, this [deal] is an attack on Canada."  Fleming is also critical of the lack of information on and the "mystification" of the  constitutional process. "People don't have a  real choice in this referendum because they  aren't really sure what the issues are or  what they're voting for. When people aren't  clear they can be more easily coerced to vote  Yes by a propaganda campaign."  Fleming calls the government's "so-called  unity" agenda is really a "disunity agenda'  "Women, for example, who are already  struggling with race, class and sexual choice  issues will now have to fight province by  province for what we need, so we are being  set up against each other. And mystifying  [the process] and not providing information  is also designed to divide lower income people as well," she says.  Fleming wants a province-wide discussion  process at the grassroots level so that the  average Canadian can better understand  what the implications of the deal are. Says  Fleming: "Let's take the Yes vote and turn  it into a No, but let's also develop an alternative that demystifies the process and  stands as a vision against the corporate  agenda"  Jackie Brown is a feminist freelance  writer out and about in Vancouver.  When Shaft declared the child support  payments on her annual tax return that  year, Revenue Canada demanded she pay  taxes on the payments in the amount of just  under $100 on the $300 a month she re-  Shaft appealed Revenue Canada's demands, but lost initially. She tried several  legal service lawyers before getting involved  with the Society for Children's Rights to  Adequate Parental Support (SCRAPS). She  was then referred to Jeanne Watchuk of the  lawfirm Bull, Housser and Tupper.  Watchuk says she was interested in the  case and agreed to take it over pro-bono  because Shaft's case is typical of many single mothers. Most women go on social assistance after marital breakups and so tax  impUcations are rarely taken into account  when determining support payments.  See TAX page 4  KINESIS A new NDP anti-poverty strategy:  Advocates for poor get $  by Kelly O'Brien  September was a lucrative month for  BC's anti-poverty groups. A press conference on September 8 with Social Services  Minister, Joan Smallwood, brought an unexpected announcement of one million dollars for advocacy groups that work with  low-income people.  "We had no idea what the announcement  was going to be about," says Linda Marcott,  a spokesperson for End Legislated Poverty  (ELP). Marcott says Smallwood called ELP  in early August to arrange a meeting to  strategize around poverty issues but she did  not mention anything about the funding.  The meeting, which brought together  representatives from ELP's 28 member  groups, and from Front-Line Advocacy  Workers (FLAW) to discuss poverty issues,  indicates an important shift in government  "Bringing together low-income people to  talk about poverty issues (with government) is new," says Pam Fleming of ELP.  This direct consultation facilitates a process whereby low-income people can educate government, she adds.  This targeting of anti-poverty groups for  funding marks a new direction for the NDP  government. Smallwood told the groups'  representatives she intends to start funding  advocacy centres that develop and promote  community solutions around poverty issues.  Until now, government funds are allocated  only to community agencies that do one-on-  one advocacy work, such as helping people  on welfare get food vouchers and advocating at welfare tribunals.  Says Marcott, "this means money wUl go  to grass roots organizations that combine  advocacy with poUtical organizing."  "I sincerely beUeve that SmaUwood is  giving money to groups to organize and educate about the structural causes of poverty,"  says Fleming. "She's funding groups to be  poUtical."

CA 94110  Under the new initiative, smaU, locaUy-  based organizations that set up projects on  low-income issues are eligible to apply for  funding. This includes 'advocacy groups'  that organize conferences and workshops,  design educational materials and assess welfare legislation, as weU as 'self-help groups'  whose primary focus is personal mutual aid  and social support. Says Marcott, the latter could include a group of low-income  women getting together to discuss their welfare rights.  The government initiative ties in with the  creation of a new Income Assistance Advisory CouncU announced by SmaUwood's  ministry last AprU. According to SmaUwood, the councU wiU advise and make recommendations to the minister on welfare  legislation and its impact on low-income  people.  "Poverty carries a significant human cost  and I need people who can help seek out  new ways of providing assistance to British  Columbians," says SmaUwood. "The councU wUl provide me with an invaluable source  of grassroots information on the impact that  government decisions have on the pubUc."  The 12 to 15 members who wiU sit on the  councU are to be appointed by SmaUwood  from a Ust of names submitted by different community groups. ELP's board of directors has nominated two representatives  to the coundl: Mary Walsey from Nanaimo  and Sherril GuUickson of 100 MUe House.  The Ministry of Women's Equahty has also  encouraged some women's groups to submit  nominations.  Fleming says, whUe she's concerned the  councU may be just another level of government bureaucracy and not a place to educate government about poverty, SmaUwood  promised ELP the councU will be "action-  oriented" on issues.  HopefuUy, says Marcott, the councU wiU  open up a pubUc dialogue and make government more accountable to poor people.  Lacking from the meeting's agenda was  time to address issues such as raising welfare rates, increasing the minimum wage or  making medicare universal by eUminating  premiums. Discussion at the meeting, says  Marcott, revolved largely around the role of  the councU.  Fleming points out that government is  "dragging its heels on welfare rates," and  that, on the whole, it was disappointing to  find that raising rates was not the ministry's  highest priority.  Instead, says Fleming, government appears to be focussing on smaUer issues, such  as possible plans to remove the distinction  between shelter and support money so that  people on welfare wiU "have more control  over their welfare cheque. This may make  hving in poverty more palatable, Fleming  adds, but it doesn't address the underlying  structural changes that are needed.  Some structural changes Marcott says  are necessary include pay equity, countering unemployment in BC—currently at  11 percent— and ending discrimination  against people who can't work for various  reasons, including single mothers who are  denied a Uvable income on welfare.  Funding anti-poverty groups and estab-  Ushing an advisory councU are steps in the  right direction, says Fleming, but past experience with any government initiative necessitates caution.

Working Class women working  In a preliminary hearing, Shaft requested  the date for her case fall after the Thibodeau ruhng. The judge argued he would  agree if she agree to follow the outcome of  that case. Shaft refused.  FoUowing the Thibodeau ruhng, Watchuk  says she is hopeful Shaft wiU win her case  and that the chaUenge of Revenue Canada's  tax law may help eradicate this sexist taxation poUcy.  Watchuk cautions, however, that protecting the rights of women and chUdren wUl require more than tax reform. It is also about  the system of family law which needs to be  changed, she says, so that levels of maintenance can be properly set.  UntU then, says Watchuk, changing the  tax system is a more direct and useful way  of protecting the rights of women and chUdren.  Shaft is currently vice-president of SCRAPS and a strong advocate for changes in  the tax law. She says research shows Canada  to be the only country in the world that  taxes chUd support payments, which, says  Shaft, "is inhumane to its chUdren."  Shaft also points out that 98 percent of  the time it is women who receive chUd support payments, so the laws are discriminatory on the basis of gender. "Canada has a  horrendous enforcement record and groups  such as SCRAPS want women's groups to  be more vocal," says Shaft. Pubhc awareness campaigns and increased pressure on  government to change unfair laws are key  elements in resolving the issue, she says.  Mijin Kim is a volunteer writer for  Kinesis.

The Conference on the Need for Second-  Stage Housing in BC is being organized by  the Greater Victoria Women's Shelter Society, with funding from the Ministry of  Women's Equahty.  "The primary purpose of this one-day  strategy planning session is to give a provincial voice to groups who want to establish  second-stage housing in communities across  the province," says conference coordinator  Anne Zurbrigg.  First-stage housing refers to transition  houses that provide immediate emergency  shelter for women and their chUdren who  are leaving physically abusive relationships.  Due to excessive demand for such shelter, women may only stay at these transition houses for a limited period. Second-  stage housing refers to transition houses for  women who require more time to take permanent steps to leave abusive partners.  At present, there are only four estab-  Ushed second-stage transition houses in BC.  These are the Act 2 Stage Choice Program  in Coquitlam, Monroe House in Vancouver,  the New Door 2nd Stage Transition Housing Society in Surrey and the Victoria 2nd  Stage Program in Victoria  However, under a-new four-year federal  program, women's groups in BC are now  able to apply for funding for 16 to 18 new  second-stage housing units. The New Step  program, an initiative of Canada Mortgage  and Housing (CMH), has a similar set up  to CMH's Project Haven. A few years ago,  this broker gave funding to cover the capital costs of renovating old housing units or  constructing new housing units for creation  of first-stage transition houses.  Zurbrigg says the New Step program is  providing the impetus for the convening of  the October conference. "As the New Step  program focuses on already existing transition houses and programs, there was some  concern that the CMH may have been setting up a situation in which women's groups  would compete for funding," she says.  "This meeting is an effort to get feminist,  woman-serving agencies to cooperate, not  compete, for second-stage housing units. We  want to determine the need for second-stage  housing in BC overaU, as weU as where the  need is greatest regionally," says Zurbrigg.  The conference was initiaUy intended  to coincide with the BC-Yukon Society of  Transition House's (BCNY) annual general  meeting in June, to ensure fuU and representative participation from women's groups  working with shelter concerns in BC.  "Unfortunately, funding from the Ministry of Women's Equahty didn't come  through in time to make that date, so the  conference was moved to coincide with the  next meeting of the BC-Yukon Society of  Transition Houses," Zurbrigg said.  "So far, 27 women have registered for the  session, representing about 20 different organizations. The Lower Mainland is weU-  represented. However, no one, as yet, has  registered from the Prince Rupert area."  Although discussion of needs and funding options for second-stage housing is welcomed by women's groups working on shelter issues, there is concern that underlying principles on the operation and role of  second-stage housing not be ignored.  "Attention must be paid to the pohtical  and phUosophical basis behind the start-up  of any new second-stage transition house,"  says Stephanie Chaytor, who sits on the  CoUective of the Battered Women's Support Services in Vancouver.  "H second-stage houses are not clear  about the values and principles on which  they are founded, women entering these  houses may find themselves in uncomfortable situations," she adds.  Chaytor used to sit on the Board of Directors of the Sanctuary Foundation, an organization that started up in the beginning  of the year. She says she left the Sanctuary  Foundation because not enough work was  being done on developing a feminist analysis on how the second-stage transition house  was to function.  "I was concerned that the work be done  before going ahead with future plans," says  Chaytor.  Sanctuary Foundation plans to set up a  second-stage transition house that allows  women to stay for up to one year. Proposed  plans also include providing housing, daycare and educational bursaries for women  leaving abusive relationships.  However, says Chaytor, "one of the criteria for entry into the Sanctuary Foundation's program is an intention on the  woman's part to return to school. That, to  me, is personalizing the issue of violence,"  Chaytor explains.  "It seems to come from an assumption  that educated women don't get battered. I  feel much more comfortable with second-  stage housing that supports the women's  needs to do whatever they need to be doing.  It might be education, but it might not be."  Ajax Quinby of Monroe House says she  would also hke the discussion of pohcy on  the agenda, but says "I have the impression it's going to be more about how to access funding." Quinby says Monroe House  opened in 1979 and is the oldest second-  stage transition house in Canada, which  means it is also one of the few that are not  "program-based."  Women unite, take back the night  The crowd seemed to dwarf the huge grounds before the Vancouver Art Gallery.  Various sources place the number of women who attended this year's Take Back  the Night march and rally on September 18 at between 1,200 and 2,000.  "I think the women's movement is having a boom this year," says Bonnie Agnew  of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter, which puts on the annual late fall  event in Vancouver. "And women's groups have never worked better together."  Speakers included the National Action Committee on the Status of Women's  Judy Rebick, Sunera Thobani from SAWAN (the South Asian Women's Action  Network), DisAbled Women of Canada's Shirley Masuda and Florence Hackett  from Indian Homemakers Association. Women marched along Robson Street this  year, and hundreds of women spectators seem to join in along the way.  "I felt excited, exhilarated ... and very validated," said Karen Amlin from South  Delta, who attended the march for the first time. "It was amazing being in a  crowd of so many, many women who feel the same way you do about such a large  issue—violence against women."  "While this definitely takes you outside your comfort zone," said Amlin, referring  to the "overwhelming" speeches she heard that night, "you walk out of there with  your head feeling so 'right."

Program-based transition house s tend to  have rules that could require women to attend support groups, subject residents to  room inspections, or, as in the case with the  Sanctuary Foundation, to attend school.  "Every woman has different needs," sayj  Quinby. "Some women can't deal with all  the things they have to deal with and go to  school."  The last thing women need is a space that  reminds her of the abusive relationship she's  leaving, she adds. "Without recognising dtf-  ferent needs, you could end up essentiaUj  telling the woman she is stupid, she is ugly  doesn't know how to look after her kids or  her money."  Ajax says she is not sure Monroe house  wiU have time to send a representative to  the conference or whether these issues wiU  be raised. But she says she's hoping the distinction between housing needs and second-  stage housing needs wUl also be on the  agenda  There is a real shortage of just any affordable, decent housing and government has to  be told "battered women do not want to  hve together in transition housing projects  for the rest of their Uves."

Sexism in the  legal system  by Agnes Huang  The Gender Bias Committee of the Law  Society of BC says our legal system is rife  with sexism. This was the main message in  a 600- page report "Gender Equahty in the  Justice System" the committee released on  September 11.  The findings and recommendations of the  committee foUows a year of consultations  with hundreds of individuals and women's  organizations around the province.  The committee makes over 300 recommendations in such areas as the legal profession, the treatment of women in the courts,  famUy law, violence against women, and  employment, human rights and immigration.  Among its recommendations, the committee calls for the creation of a separate  famUy-violence court; the decriminalization  of prostitution; the amendment of the Criminal Code to require a minimum sentence  for spousal assault on the second and subsequent conviction; and jaU to be used as  a last resort for women, since most women  commit non-violent crimes.  The report by the Law Society is an important first step towards removing sexist barriers in the legal system. HopefuUy,  the Society wUl go further and address the  racism and classism inherent in the law and  the judicial system.  Women's groups wiU be watching to see  how government, the courts, and the legal  profession implement the committee's recommendations.  In hght of two recent rulings in BC,  women are not overly optimistic that misogyny in the judicial system wUl vanish  quickly enough. In one case, Justice Jerome  Paradis found David Alexander Snow 'not  guUty' of the attempted murder of a woman  Snow tried to strangle with a plastic bag  and wire.  In the other, judge Kenneth ScherUng,  sentenced Peter MosUnger to four years  (with the possibility of parole after 16  months) after finding him guUty of sexuaUy  assaulting his daughter over a l4ryear period.  fice released an interim report on legal aid  reform on September 18 at a meeting with  representatives from community groups and  legal organizations.  The report, prepared by legal aid consultant Tim Agg, foUowed consultations ear-  Uer this year with community groups across  BC to get direct feedback on legal aid service deUvery problems.  Present at the meeting was the Ad  Hoc CoaUtion on Legal Aid Services to  Women, comprised of representatives from  community- based women's groups from  across the province. For them, the meeting  was a chance to see if its recommendations,  submitted to Agg in August, were included  in the report.  On the whole, the recommendations look  fairly positive for low- income people, says  Pam Fleming of End Legislated Poverty  (ELP). " The recommendations reaUy push  for an overhaul of the entire legal aid system."  At the meeting, Agg publicly criticized  the access to and quahty of legal aid for  women and chUdren. Agg's recommendations around restructuring famUy law focus  on discrimination that poor people—most  of whom are women—experience under the  current system of legal aid.  Key recommendations include enhancing public legal information and education  funding, establishing community law offices,  and integrating community lay advocates  into the legal aid system.  Fleming criticizes Agg for not listing the  community groups that spearheaded the legal consultation process, such as the Vancouver Status-of Women (VSW) and ELP,  in his report. "It's hke we're invisible," says  Fleming.  On the whole, says Fleming, the report  imphes Agg had the people who use legal  aid in mind when drawing up the recommendations.  Women's groups stiU have a lot more  consulting left to do, says Miche HUl of  VSW. "Now, it's a matter of identifying  whether the CoaUtion's recommendations  match Agg's."

The Court ChaUenges Program gave disadvantaged groups access to the courts to  ensure that equahty and language rights  provided under the Charter of Rights and  Freedoms are enforced. The program has  been an vital source of funding for LEAF  (Women's Legal and Action Fund), who received $250,000 last year for Charter challenges. It was scrapped by the federal government, which claimed it had served its  purpose and was not required further.  In heu of the reinstatement of the program, the advisory committee has proposed the creation of an independent Court  Challenges Foundation which wiU fund test  Charter cases with provincial and federal  money. The Foundation wiU have an arms-  length relationship with government.  This is only second-best, however, to the  already existing program which is "exceUent  in its current form," says a committee briel  Fears are being raised around future (lack  of) access women and other equahty seeking groups wiU have to the courts. The fate  of court chaUenges wiU be clear by mid-  November, when the federal government  must respond to the advisory committees  recommendations.  Plea for funds  from Ireland  by Elizabeth O'Shea  The Dubhn Abortion Information Campaign (DAIC) is sending out a desperate  plea for funds from the international community to help its fight against entrenched  anti-choice forces and the Roman Cathohc  Church in Ireland.  WhUe national opinion on abortion information and abortion rights has seen a  dramatic change recently, pohtical parties,  pohticians, unions, and businesses wiU not  be associated with DAIC or any pro-choice  group because they find it too dangerous to  be associated with abortion issues.  As a result, DAIC is running its campaign on smaU donations from individuals.  The majority of potential donors are playing 'wait and see.' DAIC is asking for donations of any size to help it continue to get  pro-choice information out and campaign to  repeal the anti-woman Eighth Amendment  from the Irish constitution.  Under the anti-choice amendment inserted into the Irish constitution in 1983,  the Attorney-General filed an injunction  preventing a 14-year-old girl rape victim  from traveUing to Britain to obtain an abortion. This foUowed a Supreme Court ruUng  earlier this year permitting the 14-year-old  girl to obtain the abortion. The court also  ruled abortion be legal in Ireland for certi-  fiably suicidal women.  Three of the five judges also said that  injunctions may be granted against non-  suicidal pregnant women suspected of trying to leave the state to obtain an abortion.  At present, no woman can obtain a legal abortion in Ireland under any circumstances, women's health books containing  information on abortion clinics have been  removed from libraries, and no one can give  out abortion information to anyone for any  reason.  Also, on August 7, the High Court made  permanent an injunction taken by the Society for the Protection of the Unborn ChUd  prohibiting students from giving out abortion information. In hght of this ruhng, it is  quite possible that pubUcations such as foreign phone directories wUl be censored.  DAIC actively breaks the court injunctions because at least 5,000 Irish women  travel abroad for abortions every year.  These women need information so they may  travel safely to safe clinics, and they need  abortion facUities in Ireland.  DAIC beUeves Irish women should not  have to suffer any longer, that women have  a right to reproductive choice and to un-  censored information on pregnancy options.  They are asking women abroad to help them  claim these rights.  DAIC's bank will accept cheques in  foreign currency. Please make them  payable to Dublin Abortion Information  Campaign and send them to PO Box  3327, Dublin 8, Ireland. We will acknowledge all donations.

In early September, Amjad Alvi, a  Toronto family physician, announced plans  to open up sex pre-selection chnics in  Toronto and Vancouver. The chnics are  scheduled to be in operation by the end of  October.  The procedure involves separating sperm  using a gradient of salt solution and human  albumen (an egg white-like substance). At  the end of the process, the sperm leading  to the desired sex is selected and artificiaUy  inseminated into the woman.  "It's Uke a swimming competition in the  Olympics," Alvi said in a radio interview.  "You put the male and the female competitors together and you have them swim  through heats, quarter finals, and semifinals; if you get to the finals you'U have a  majority being male because they're faster  swimmers ... if you want to have a female  baby ...  then you pick the slower swim-  The procedure was patented by American reproductive biologist Ronald Ericsson.  There are 49 sex pre-selection clinics that  use Ericsson technique in the US.  The initial consultation fee proposed by  Alvi is $150, and each artificial insemination  attempt costs $500. It usuaUy takes two or  three attempts for the artificial insemination to result in pregnancy.  StiU, the chosen sex of the baby is not  guaranteed. The success rate for boy chUdren is 80 percent and for girl chUdren 67  percent.  What choice?  Alvi has tried to co-opt the feminist hne of  choice in pushing the technology on women.  'We're just providing a service," says Alvi  in the Province. "Canada has a free society and women should have a choice."  Alvi refused to comment to Kinesis.  "There is a real manipulation in the  use of the term 'choice'. The avaUabUity  of this technology promotes a 'value' and  not a 'choice'," counters Joy Thompson,  spokesperson of the BC CoaUtion for Abortion Clinics (BCCAC) and longtime feminist health activist.  Beverly Bain of the National Action  Committee on the Status of Women (NAC)  says that women rarely get consulted on the  use of reproductive technologies.  "We haven't heard, women say this is  what they want," retorts Bain. "Men, the  biomedical industry, pharmaceutical companies are making decisions for us about  what we should be choosing. Once again it's  men making a profit pushing this technology-"  "Right from the beginning the medical community has worked to devise technologies to improve the chances of having  male chUdren," says Sue Cox of the Vancouver Reproductive Technologies CoaUtion  (VRTC). Ericsson developed his sperm separation technology in 1973 as a method of  increasing the chances of having sons.  What's the difference?  Alvi says he does not beUeve there are any  ethical issues around the technology he is  marketing. He promotes sex pre-selection as  the preferred option to sex selection—the  abortion of the fetus if it's of the undesired  "I'm against the idea of a female fetus being aborted because of its sex," Alvi says in  a Globe and Mail article. "I would never  refer one of my patients to someone who  [performs abortions].**  The chair of the Royal Commission on  New Reproductive Technologies, Patricia  Baird, also emphasizes the difference between sex-selection and sex pre-selection  technology.  Baird says sex selection involves terminating the fetus whUe "in sex pre-selection,  it's simply trying to influence which sex wUl  be conceived."  But women's health care advocates say  that the ethical issues have nothing to do  with whether sex selection occurs before of  after conception.  "Sex pre-selection is not benign any more  than sex selection or in vitro fertiUzation or  surrogacy," says BCCAC's Thompson.  Amjad Alvi has specificaUy targeted the  Indo-Canadian and Chinese-Canadian communities with the technology. This is not  the first time the South Asian community  has been pinned as consumers for this type  of sex-selection technology.  Alvi's interest in Vancouver was sparked  by news reports last year of a clinic in  Blaine, Washington which uses an ultrasound technique to determine the sex of the  fetus, which often leads to the abortion of  female fetuses.  The US doctor, John Stevens, marketed  directly to the South Asian community using the community's newspapers.  Alvi says that South Asian and Chinese  cultures have traditions of preferring boys  to girls. "I know [the communities] are there  and there is a demand for [sex pre-selection  technology]."  Adds Cox, "making a distinction between  sex selection and sex pre-selection does not  recognize sex pre-selection as the eugenic  sexist technology that it is."  Technologies which discriminate on the  basis of sex aU fall under the Canadian  Medical Association's (CMA) guidelines for  sex-selection technologies says Eike-Henner  Kluge, principal author of the CMA's Code  of Ethics.  "The principle behind sex-selection and  sex pre-selection technology is the same^-  the preference of one gender over the other."  The CMA's Code of Ethics states that  sex-selection technologies for non-medical  reasons should be prohibited as ethically  unacceptable. The Code was approved  unanimously by the CMA's general councU in 1991 and is binding on aU its 63,000  members.  It goes beyond sex selection  The acceptance of such technology goes beyond sex selection and into the realm of  eugenics-promotion of a 'master race'.  Women's groups say the avaUabUity of  sex pre-selection technology promotes discrimination by encouraging the use of genetic manipulation to 'improve' the population by breeding out 'undesirable' traits.  Andrew Waight, Alvi's personal and  business manager, stresses that the procedure is simUar to normal pregnancy. "We're  not [practising] genetic engineering—there  is no genetic engineering at aU in this procedure."  But NAC's Bain disagrees. "The logical  procession is blond, blue-eyed babies,"says  Bain. "What kind of imbalance wiU this lead  to in our society? Where is this going to go?  It's very dangerous."  Anjula Gogia of SAWAN (the South  Asian Women's Action Network) sees Alvi  as an opportunist. "He's playing up the  racist and sexist stereotyped assumptions  that»South Asians prefer boys to girls."  "What we are seeing is the private entrepreneurial promotion of racist, sexist  and non-women centred technology," says  Thompson.  The proliferation of sex-selection technology sets off a lot of alarm beUs. "The avaUabUity of sex pre-selection technology opens  the door to the whole question about controlling the demographics of society," says  Cox of the VRTC.  "Who would control the "balance in society? I don't think we are prepared to let the  state or the medical profession make those  decisions."  Over in Ontario  A sex pre-selection clinic in Toronto would  not be a new thing. AUan Abramovitch has  been operating a sex pre-selection clinic in  nearby Scarborough using the same techniques as Ericsson since 1987.  Abramovitch says in the Globe and  Mail that sex selection is just another form  of famUy planning. "Just as couples have an  option of controlling the numbers of their  famUy, they also have the option of controlling the gender of their family."  Abramovitch did not return Kinesis' requests for an interview.  None of the medical and health bodies in  Ontario take any responsibility for regulating the operation of sex pre-selection chnics  in the province.  "It doesn't seem clear who has the power  to prevent or support [the use of this technology]." says Layne Verbeek, spokesperson  for the Ontario ministry of health.  WhUe the ministry opposes the use of sex  pre-selection technology, it claims that regulation of such clinics is not under its jurisdiction.  "The ministry of health only regulates insured services," says Verbeek. "Sex selection is uninsured because it is experimental  and non-medicaUy necessary."  But the CMA's former director of ethics  Eike-Henner Kluge counters that "in Ontario, under the Independent Medical Practitioners Act, the ministry of health can step  in and look at the operation of private clinics."  The Ontario Medical Association also  says its hands are tied in taking action  against any members who perform the procedure even though they are opposed to sex-  selection technology.  MeanwhUe, the Ontario CoUege of Physicians and Surgeons has no position on  whether Alvi should be aUowed to set up  his chnic in Toronto.  "The CoUege does not have a position  on sex selection at the moment," says  spokesperson Jim Maclean. "This is an  area of ethics, rather than medical practice  guidelines."  Maclean says the Ontario CoUege wUl  sanction technologies that are bona fide  medical procedures—bona fide is defined in  terms of safety and not ethics. The Ontario  CoUege also does not require doctors practising sex selection to be specialists in the  field—doctors only needs to show a level of  competence.  Kluge points out that "the mandate of  the CoUeges is to act as a pubUc advocate  and not as a representative of the medical  profession, and to ensure pubUc safety and  to effect a code of ethics."  Meanwhile, back in BC ...  It is unlikely that Alvi wUl be able to set  up a clinic in BC by the end of October if  at all. He has yet to apply for a Ucence to  practise medicine in BC.  Tom Handley, registrar of the CoUege of  Physicians and Surgeons of BC, says the  CoUege would also have serious ethical concerns about the establishment of a sex preselection chnic in the province.  "The CoUege has adopted the CMA's  code of ethics," says Handley. "The CMA  has come out with a firm stance; they are  ethically opposed to non-medical sex selection. I can see no reason why the CoUege  would take a different stand."  Women's groups are not going to sit stiU  waiting for governments and the medical  community to take action. Feminists have  put reproductive technologies high on the  agenda for this year.  The strong opposition from women's  groups is making Alvi reconsider opening a  clinic in Vancouver.  But if he does go ahead with his plan,  SAWAN's Gogia says women's groups wiU  be ready for him. "We wUl demonstrate if  this clinic opens up."  The National Film Board is hosting  the public premiere of the documentary  series on new reproductive technologies,  On the Eighth Day: Perfecting Mother Nature.

KINESIS a*SS*****SS*SSSSiS5**S^^  FEATURE  ■1  The North American Free Trade Agreement:  Tratado de exploitation  by Jean Swanson  For the last couple of years, as an activist in the movement to stop free trade,  I've been saying that one of the problems  with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is that it wiU create 'competitive poverty.' That is, millions of workers wUl be forced to underbid workers in  other countries, provinces and cities in order to lure corporations to their area to create jobs. Wages wUl get lower and lower.  Also, the corporations wiU negotiate  with, or blackmail, governments to reduce  taxation levels and enforcement of poUution  regulations. The result wiU be that most  people get poorer and poorer, especiaUy  women and chUdren, more of them wiU Uve  miserable Uves and die sooner. It's aU quite  logical.  On September 14,1 took a tour that put  human faces on the rhetoric, women's human faces. I was in Reynosa, Mexico, just  across the border from McAUen in South  Texas, for a somewhat boring conference on  human rights and the NAFTA.  Toward the end of the conference, some  women from the Highlander Centre in Tennessee, who had been working with women  organizing in the MaquUadoras zones in  Reynosa, brought the Mexican women organizers to the conference. Some of the Canadian and American women organized a tour  of the area with them.  This is what we saw, and what our two  women organizer guides told us:  The MaquUadoras are huge warehouse-  Uke buUdings, simUar to the big ones in  Richmond, BC for Sony, Toyota, etc. They  have nice flowers planted around them, and  look very clean. They are surrounded by  cyclone fences with three rows of barbed  wire, and don't have windows to speak oL In  this area, some of the factories were owned  by Lintel (which makes telephone parts for  AT&T), Zenith, General Motors, Sony, and  Converse, which manufactures shoes which  cost about $100 a pair, according to a  woman from the Toronto delegation.  That $50 per shoe is three times what  a women working in the MaquUadoras gets  in a week. In the Converse factory, women  have to produce 60 pieces of a shoe every  five minutes. One third to one half of a  woman's pay is in coupons which have to  be spent in certain stores. Our guide told U3  that five percent of the workers are 13 and  14 years old. Parents have no choice but to  alter birth certificates so their chUdren can  get jobs.  There is no chUdcare program. Women  often have to leave their chUdren alone and  they sometimes get hurt. Sexual harassment  is common. The women get a 15-minute  break in the morning, a half-hour for lunch.  In some places, women "go on report" if  they have to go to the bathroom twice in a  day.  We then visited a toxic waste dump. It  looked Uke a series of smaU lakes. You could  see, even from a distance, the reflection of  the blue sky and the clouds in-them. Our  guides told us the 'lagoons' we were seeing had been dynamited into the countryside. They had seen Zenith trucks dumping waste into the 'lagoons.' At first there  was one bigger lake, but now the companies were dumping dirt in and trying to fiU  them in. We walked on some of this fill. The  whole place smeUed awful. I can't describe  it. But the most dramatic moment came  when our young guides threw rocks into the  Uquid so we could see the colour and consistency of the substance that splashed up.  It was a brownish black, thicker than water.  A tire sitting in it had been partiaUy eaten  away. Our guides said the road to the dump  had been paved by the MaquUadoras owners. Beside the dump was a corn field and,  a Uttle farther on, a school.  I wondered if the truck fuU of corn I had  seen in the city, being shucked by a group  of men, came from this farm. We aU wondered what was happening to water weUs  in the area. Farmers, we were told, are beginning to complain that crops in the area  aren't growing that weU.  A member of our delegation took a soU  sample to get tested in Canada. When we  were back at the hotel, she took out the tiny  film case she had put the soil in and we aU  had a whiff of it. It was amazing how strong  just a tiny amount of soU could smeU.  We went by army barracks as we drove  to the last place on our tour—ViUa Roma,  a group of shacks where some of the  MaquUadoras workers Uved. The homes  were next to a creek that overflowed when  it rained, so the paths in the vUlage were  mud, with Uttle pieces of wood to step on  here and there.  The residents had dug a trench about  three feet wide and deep, running from the  creek through the vUlage, to drain off some  of the water. But some houses were on stilts,  others raised on several cement blocks.  The houses were very smaU, enough room  for a table and chairs and maybe a bed. In  one case, the bed was under a house that  was up on stilts. Rickety fences surrounded  each house and rickety outhouses with blankets for doors. Some people were growing  beans in their yard, and there were one or  two chickens running around.  We felt very intrusive going to visit but  our organizer said the people were accustomed to it. She introduced us to a woman  whose husband worked in the MaquUadoras. The woman had three chUdren, and also  took care of the four chUdren of her two sisters, who also worked in the MaquUadoras.  The woman's chUdren came out of the house  to join her in talking to us, first the older  one, about eight, then the younger—two Uttle girls in pretty dresses.  The next morning, the local paper carried a story of a MaquUadoras whose workers have been on strike since February because of contract violations. The women  have a union but, as the organizers o:  our tour and others we met at the Human Rights conference told us, it is corrupt and undemocratic. The MaquUadoras  was closed down because of the strike. The  owners wouldn't give in to the women. The  union organizer didn't seem too perturbed.  He said there would be other opportunities  for work in the area.  The MaquUadoras existed before free  trade. But with free trade, governments will  have less clout to stop corporations from  moving to places where wages and taxes  are low and poUution standards lax. Governments of countries where conditions Uke  these prevaU, are unable to legislate im  proved standards on corporations, or corporations .wUl flee to other countries with]  lax—more affordable—standards.  I thought of the MaquUadoras women  who had lost the strike. The company wouh  probably open up the factory again anc  hire women who aren't "troublemakers." I  the women had won the strike, perhaps the  company would have gone to Guatemala to  seek even lower wages. How would the workers in Guatemala hve on wages that were  less than these people made?  ■3 I thought again of the woman with thel  i three chUdren we met at VUla Roma. We  * had asked her if she had thought at aU  £ about the free trade deal. Understandably  S. she said that she hadn't reaUy had the time  « But the two organizers who were ourl  i[ guides refused to caU it NAFTA. They  s caUed it "Tratado de Exploitation." the  Treaty of Exploitation.  WHAT YOU CAN DO  • Educate yourself, your famUy, friends, and community about free trade.  • Discuss the impUcations of the free trade agreement and the North American Free Trade  Agreement for your women's organization and decide how your group can fight back (invite a resource person to help).  • Form or join a local coaUtion.  • Organize to abrogate (get rid of) the Free Trade Agreement in the next election.  • Organize to cancel the North American free trade agreement.  • Join the Hands Across The Border demonstration October 18 at the border. CaU the  BC Federation of Labour for further information.  • Support striking sisters—K-Mart is a multinational corporation.  • On September 28, an analysis by a coaUtion of organizations in three countries wiU focus on fourteen points of the NAFTA text to determine the impact of the agreement on  people, rather than corporations. A second stage of the analysis is being carried out by  women's groups in each of the three countries to determine specificaUy what the agreement wUl mean for women. In Canada, this analysis is being carried out by The National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC)'s Global Strategies Group.  Watch for upcoming articles on the analysis in Kinesis.  • A tri-national occupational health and safety conference is being co-sponsored by Women  and Work, a Vancouver feminist organization, and Mujer e Mujer, a coaUtion of women's  organizations in Mexico. The conference wiU be held May 27-29, 1993 in Vancouver. To  get involved, caU Lois or Lynn at 430-0458.  When the plane took off from McAUen  Texas the next morning, I had a window  seat. Looking down, I saw acres of huge estates with swimming pools next to a luxurious looking golf course. I wondered if the  owners of those estates were people successfuUy lured by McAUen Texas Chamber of  Commerce to their town with their video on  the wonders of investing in the MaquUadoras.  The Mexican human rights activists tolc  us that there is no hope of stopping the  NAFTA in Mexico. They do not have a  democratic government. When the majority  do elect opposition members, electoral frauc  and brute force take over to ensure estab-  Ushment poUticians get control. Stopping  the NAFTA has got to happen in Canada  and the US, they told us.

Geller and Smita Patil  October could be a great month for  Vancouver lesbians with appetites for  some interesting debate on a range of  cultural, legal and political issues. The  second pan-Canadian conference on lesbian and gay rights takes place in Vancouver. Billed as a forum for lesbians  and gays from diverse communities to  "evaluate our work, strengthen our alliances and focus our energies," OutRights/Les Droits Visibles has extended  its mandate to look beyond legal issues.  Kinesis takes a peek at some of what's  on the menu at the conference.  With the inclusion of six streams, or  themes, this year, the conference promises  a range of lesbian and gay rights issues. Streams include: StiU Ain't Satisfied:  AIDS/HIV Issues; MobUizing for Change;  FamUy Matters; Straight Up; Rights and  Wrongs; and Working in Law. Each stream  is made up of a number of workshops facUi-  tated by lesbians and gay men from communities across Canada. There are also panels,  small group discussions and media presentations.  In FamUy Matters, workshop topics  range from famUy benefits, adoption and  foster care, to pubUc services for lesbian and  gay youths. EUen Faulkner and Christine  Aubin of Kingston, Ontario, wiU faciUtate  a workshop on battering in lesbian relationships. The workshop raises some of the whys  and wherefores of lesbian abuse, identifying  some ways in which the social and legal systems faU to offer adequate support, and offering some avenues for improvement to existing support structures.  "It is very  difficult to  openly discuss  building on  common ground,  a real politic  among ourselves..."  - Punam Khosla,  panelist on "Living  Colour"  In the another workshop, Dorothy-Jean  O'DonneU, a private practitioner from the  Lower Mainland, wiU sit on a panel on lesbian parenting. Central issues include custody and access, artificial insemination in  lesbian relationships and the legal rights of  non-biological mothers.  Rights & Wrongs is described as an umbreUa stream for a misceUany of issues. It  is the largest, with 16 workshops and topics that include international rights issues,  Charter matters, human rights struggles for  sexual orientation protection, reteUing our  histories and creating erotic lesbian images.  In one of the workshops, Persimmon  Blackbridge of the Vancouver-based Kiss  and TeU performance art collective wUl continue the debate on feminist lesbian erotic  images and pornography.  kAkAAAAkkAkAkkkkk  ouTmms  tftnl/MLES  In Straight Up, a series of workshops,  forums and smaU group caucuses discuss  various strategies for addressing homophobia and intolerance in unions, the education  system, churches, the workplace, media, the  arts and the judicial system. Among presenters is Anne Molgate, chair of NAC's Lesbian Issues Committee who wiU address "  ... how homophobia operates in the arts,  sports and recreation and community organizations, in images, in pohcies, in invisible  and visible discrimination.  Although the conference has a broad  agenda for lesbian and gay rights, organizers have worked hard to recognize the differing levels of privUege that we Uve with as  white able-bodied, middle class women or  men. It remains to be seen U differences between lesbians and gays as men and women  m?TT??T?wm?  In the same workshop, Vancouver artist  Cynthia Low plans to raise issues concerning erotica created by lesbians of colour.  Says Low: "I'm going to talk about how lesbians of colour have to think about being  respectful of other women of colour and our  own culture in terms of what's being presented and not being appropriated by the  white viewer—not being made exotic and  being trivialized."  Lesbians of colour also have to be careful about being tokenized, says Low. "We're  not speaking for aU lesbians of colour but  speaking for ourselves ... often images get  tokenized. So [I'm talking about] personal  censorship in terms of what comes out and  what we choose to show publicly because of  the pohtical analyses of the community."  WhUe the workshop does not claim to offer solutions to issues, it does provide a forum for exploring them. Kiss and TeU wUl  also perform their lesbian performance art  piece, True Inversions, as part of the conference's cultural activities. In the workshop, "Fighting state censorship of our images, books and magazines," Janine FuUer,  of Little Sisters Book Store in Vancouver,  reports on struggles against state censorship  of lesbian erotica such as Bad Attitude.  ■ In a workshop called "DeaUng with  the Cops," Punam Khosla, a Toronto lesbian and anti-racist activist, Unks struggles against racism with struggles against  homophobia in the context of organizing  against pohce violence towards people of  colour and lesbian/gays. "What we're seeing is not just repression but domestic mU-  itarization," says Khosla  "What we've been seeing in Toronto is  this thing about 'the black threat' and it's  Uke ... there was this thing in Vancouver  recently about 'Asian gangs' in Vancouver.  Are we, as lesbians and gays, going to make  compromises with the pohce? Are we going  to make this a central issue? Or are we going to say that's up to the black community?" she says. And that's only a teaser for  what Khosla plans to talk about.  MobUizing for Change is a stream that  looks deeply within the lesbian community  at organizing principles and the need for  change. It deals specificaUy with the necessity of mobUizing our communities across  gender, race, class and abiUty hnes to forge  an inclusive agenda for change.  Topics include coaUtion buUding, issues  for First Nations lesbians and gays and two-  spirited peoples, internalized homophobia,  and racism in the white gay lesbian community.  Says Khosla, who is also speaking at a  workshop in this stream called "In Living  Colour," "there are a lot of obstacles that  are not openly being discussed. It is very difficult to openly discuss buUding a common  ground, a real pohtic among ourselves ...  for example] there are some fairly serious  differences between men and women [such  as] the fundamental difference that women  are dealing with misogyny and sexism."  Surprisingly, only four workshops are offered in the stream, Working in the Law—  OutRights' initial mandate was to address  legal issues. One of the workshops looks at  workplace issues specific to law as a profession, whUe another deals with homophobia  in the judiciary.  "...lesbians  of colour  have to  think about...  not being  appropriated  by the  |      white viewer,  i   being made exotic  |     and therefore  t       trivialized."  - Cynthia Low,  panelist on  "Hot Images"  wUl be addressed or a meaningful feminist  agenda wiU emerge at the conference leveL  To make the conference as accessible  as possible, the conference offers a shding  scale for registration fees—$25 to $250—  wheelchair accessibihty, sign language interpretation, child care and bUleting. Conference organizers also say they had planned  on making simultaneous French-English  translation avaUable but poor federal funding has forced them to cut back. However,  one entire program stream, CoUections, is  devoted to caucuses and informal discussions where participants can meet, network  and make connections.  Conspicuously absent from the conference's agenda are issues specific to bisexuality. This is surprising given the scope of the  conference overaU. It is, perhaps, one example of exclusion that mars a somewhat inclusive agenda  In aU, .the very scope OutRights/Les  Droits Visibles' agenda is testimony not  only to how far lesbians have come in recent  years, but also how far we have left to go.  From the looks of things, OutRights could  make a valuable contribution to towards addressing racism, classism and heterosexism  within our communities and in society as a  whole.    Lissa J.

KINESIS w  COMMENTARY  ^XX^^^^v^^NXXXX^^  Violence against women:  Raising the issues  by Seema Ahluwalia  In August, a white male academic, 'angered' at his treatment at the hands of his  peers and the administration of Concordia  University in Montreal, murdered three of  his male coUeagues. Over the thunder of the  public outcry that foUowed, I heard a deafening sUence—a curious lack of outrage expressed in the mainstream media over violence against women.  As we grieve for recent victoms of male  violence—Cindy James, Alexandra Pesic,  Susan Moshnger and many others—we are  reminded of the daily violence meted out  against us and of what it means to Uve in  fear for our Uves and the hves of our sisters.  And yet when we raise our concerns in pubUc we wonder, are they faUing on deaf ears?  Two weeks before her death, Burnaby  resident Alexandra Pesic reported to the  pohce that she had been stalked by two  men [see Kinesis Sept/92]. There were witnesses, and she had managed to get a description of the stalkers' car and hcense  plates. We also know that the Burnaby poUce had from 10 to 24 complaints on file relating to Pesic's case, and that a restraining order had been issued against her ex-  husband. The pohce response was that, because no weapon had been found and Pesic  was able to return "safely" home, no further  action by them was necessary.  Women in Ufe-threatening situations  need to know they wiU get a meaningful  response from the pohce. Tragically, there  is much to suggest otherwise. It appears  that records of calls are seldom kept, information is often recorded incorrectly, reports are sometimes not submitted, and violent incidents are often not categorized as  crimes. This leads us to conclude that poUce do not regard violence against women as  'serious' poUce work, despite evidence that  shows a high proportion of domestic homicides involve households known to the pohce for prior violence.  As a result, women, particularly women  of colour, have developed a mistrust of the  poUce for many reasons, including ineffective response, being blamed for provoking  the violence, and having to suffer reprisal  i.ecause of lack of protection.  Pohce practice tends to be guided by a  patriarchal ideology that reinforces a particular image of 'privacy' of the family.  Most violence against women is done by  men known to them, yet society persists in  perpetuating the racist myth of the 'dark  stranger' as woman's nemesis, as it does  the myth of the woman who remains safe  as long as she maintains her position behind her man in his home. Sexist and racist  bias in pohcing, combined with the practice of non-intervention, has kept evidence  of violence against women off police records.  These practices isolate women, and leave  them without protection in violent situations.  In this way, rather than addressing the  problem, a pohcy of mandatory arrest  serves to intensify the isolation a woman of  colour may already experience, as she strug-  ' gles to choose between her own protection  and the protection of her community from  poUce harassment.  I raise this point now because I hear the  voices of some sisters calling for more pohce  resources to fight violence against women.  I worry that pohce can use this agitation  as an excuse to further harass non-white  communities, only this time in the guise of  'feminist initiative.' women must consider  that over-pohcing of racial minority communities already exists and that, by endors-  and racist bias  Sexist  in policing, combined with the practice  of non-intervention, has kept evidence of  violence against women off  police records.  In response to feminist calls for pohce ac-  countabUity, federal and provincial governments have suggested that the right course  of action is to aUow mandatory arrests. This  means that the pohce could press charges,  even when a woman who is the subject of  violence does not want to. It is ironic that  women's lack of power in this society is. being used as an excuse to further empower  the pohce.  In reaUty, women may not want to take  this course of action for many practical reasons. Women of colour, for example, are  used to continual pohce harassment of their  male counterparts. This pohcy of mandatory arrest may create even further reluctance to report violence, as it would mean  drawing more unwanted pohce attention to  our communities.

The focus of our efforts should be to provide women with real options. More pohcing  is not needed, more sensitive pohcing is. A  woman who has suffered violence has a right  to choose her course of action. Attempts  to wrest control away from the woman by  various means, including forcing her to testify in court against her wUl, must be challenged. The issue is meaningful pohce action and pohce accountabUity. Law enforcement agents must foUow up cases and take  appropriate legal action to enforce injunctions and other aspects of the law.  Beyond this, it is clear that the responsibiUty for ending male violence against  women must be taken elsewhere. Lower  Mainland pohce now have ten detectives  working on Alexandra Pesic's case, but it's  a case of too httle, too late. Feminists come  at the problem of violence against women  in a very different way—solving 'mysteries'  is not our concern. We want to stop crimes  against women from happening ... now!  So far, the only crime-prevention strategies that have worked effectively have been  the ones women take themselves. Sadly,  these strategies include hving in a perpetual  state of fear, moving many mUes away from  home, changing your name and cutting off  aU contact with your previous hfe. Women  must sacrifice housing, jobs, friendships and  even their families in order to protect themselves. In the week before her death, Pesic  did not go to work because she was afraid  for her hfe. This is the price we pay to stay  alive.  In the wake of Pesic's murder, an RCMP  officer said the pohce cannot "predict violence." Today, I bring great news to the  pohce, to the Canadian Panel on Violence  Against Women, and to the establishment  that claims they are working to end this  violence: the information is right there. It  amazes me that they are aU so confused and  unsure of what to do and where to get information. If they really want to stop violent crime against women, then they should  talk to women in the community.  The war on women has taken too many  casualties, and the response of the government has been to put up smokescreens, the  response of the pohce has been to ignore  the safety needs of women, and the response  of academics and professionals has been to  try and cash in on tragedy by calling for  more research and money for professional  services.  There are community members who are  working to end the violence against our  mothers and sisters and daughters, who  care about women, who beUeve in them  and want to validate their experiences. And  these people are the frontline workers in  transition houses, women's centres and crisis centers.  Let us continue our war on male violence against women and fight back. We  must continue to demand fuU funding for  transition houses, safe networks, crisis hnes,  women's centers and support networks, organizations working towards making real  options accessible to women and chUdren  dealing with male violence.  These are not mere 'band-aid' solutions, but crime-prevention networks where  women come together to share their rage  and strategize for the next battle. These  centres must be the top priority for funding, even if it means diverting funds from  other areas. We don't need more academic  research, and we don't need more pohce.  Funds must be given to the frontline workers who are taking the lead in combatting  this violence, and the pohce must take guidance from these women.  PoUce, professionals and academics deal  with violence against women as a series of  discrete and separate phenomenon. We demand recognition that patriarchal violence  is more than isolated incidents of beatings  and rape. We struggle with our sisters who  are exploited and poisoned at work, deprived of economic dignity, sexuaUy and  racially abused and harassed in the work  place, dehumanized and abused by psychiatrists, teachers, and rehgious leaders.  We struggle against male violence in order to create an atmosphere where men are  not able to abuse women with impunity  and, more importantly, where women are  able to individually and coUectively fight  back. We know male violence against  women is not the result of the isolated actions of a few sick men, but an integral part  of the oppression of women. Nor is it a crime  of passion, or a crime against the state. It  is a pohtical crime.  In aU, we celebrate the indomitable spirit  of resistance and survival that is evidenced  daily through the struggles of so many  women. Oh, my sisters who rise up from  the beatings to feed your chUdren, who raU  against those who would use their power  to try to nullify your Ufe, who every day  stretch the boundaries of human courage  and tenacity—by praising your names, your  struggles, my heart grows stronger, and my  convictions firmer.

KINESIS   Oct. 92 NAC's  No  A constitutional  question  s"»«>co$:>  Shelagh Day:  Judy Rebick:  by Jackie Brown  by Fatima Jaffer  The National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) is calling for  a No-vote in the October 26 constitutional referendum. In the following interview  with Kinesis, NAC vice-president Shelagh Day outlines her organization's main concerns.  Jackie Brown: NAC's major problems with this deal include the impact on social programs, erosion of equahty rights and non-recognition of Aboriginal women's concerns. Let's  start with the impact on social programs and how it wUl affect women in particular.  Shelagh Day: This goes to the very centre of the deal and how power in this country  is going to be divided. The reason the constitutional talks are happening is because Quebec has been arguing legitimately for some time now that the federal government's influence in Quebec should be weakened so that it can pursue its own interests in protecting  its culture, language and distinctiveness.  In our view, poUticians should have devolved [handed over] certain powers to Quebec  but not to the rest of the provinces. Instead, this deal treats all provinces the same. This  weakens federal government influence overall and increases provincial government power  by, for example, restricting federal spending power in the provinces and devolving powers  in certain key pohcy areas to the provinces.  In NAC's view, this wiU mean a patchwork of social programs and social regulation that  will make it much more difficult for women to get and maintain standards of equahty in areas of social regulation that matter to us. We'U be fighting province by province to maintain or obtain what we need.  Brown: So, a national chUdcare program, for example, which women have been demanding for years, may be out the window for good?  Day: Our assessment is that we wiU never see a national chUdcare program because of  the restrictions to federal spending power.  Brown: And by federal spending power you mean ... ?  Day: The government's abihty to spend tax doUars to create national cost-shared programs, even in areas that are under provincial jurisdiction Uke health, education, and social assistance. Medicare is a national cost-shared program. When women think about a  national chUdcare program, we're thinking of something along the same hnes—a federal  program for aU provinces that would include national standards so that no matter where  you hved, you could depend on certain access and standards of quaUty.  We don't think a federal chUdcare program wiU happen for two reasons: First, just as  the Meech Lake accord did, this deal says provinces can opt out of a national cost-shared  program with compensation if they have another initiative that meets national objectives.  We don't know what "initiative" means because it's not defined. And there is no pubUc  process to define "national objectives." First ministers wiU decide what "national objectives " mean in closed-door meetings.  Brown: So if this deal gets a 'yes' in the referendum and the federal government decides  miraculously to establish a chUdcare program, the BC government could opt out?  Day: And take the money.  Brown:... and use it to estabUsh a provincial program that might not meet v  needs depending on what criteria are involved?  On September U, NAC announced they wUl campaign for a No-vote on the proposed constitutional accord in the October 26 referendum. Describing the accord  as a "bad deal" for women and minority groups, NAC president Judy Rebick explains, "when we discussed holding our noses and voting yes, we choked." Kinesis  spoke with Rebick in Vancouver on September 18.  Fatima Jaffer: In the 1982 constitutional talks, NAC fought for and got some key  changes at the eleventh hour. Why did NAC decide to vote No this time, and not 'we'U  wait and see'? Isn't NAC's decision a httle premature?  Rebick: WeU, we looked at the changes we would want in order to make the deal acceptable to us and then at the changes we could possibly get—given what we know about  the the dynamics among the premiers, what they're wUling or might be willing to go for  and what they are not wUling to go for. In the end, we realized there were no changes that  we could get that would make the deal acceptable.  The issue is this—we beheve the deal's a bad deal. The first question we asked ourselves  is, what's our goal here? Do we want to defeat the deal or do we want to force changes? We  had to answer these questions to decide what our strategy would be. After several hours  of discussion, it became clear that what the executive wanted was to bring down the deal.  And if you want to bring down the deal, then you've got to decide early. We only had six  weeks. If you don't come out untU later in the referendum campaign, you've got no hope  of bringing down the deal.  The other thing about making the decision fast is that, in NAC's constitution, there  is only one body that can make this decision. That's the executive. Since we only have  three executive meetings a year, and it costs us $12,000 to have an executive meeting, we  couldn't afford to have a special one. We had to make the decision at that meeting—there  was no other way to make it because the next meeting's not untU November.  Jaffer: So how many women made the decision? How many women are on NAC's executive?  Rebick: Twenty-three.  Jaffer: And how many are from Quebec?  Rebick: Three. They represent different constituencies in Quebec. We have an immigrant woman, we have a woman who's been involved in the trade union movement, and  someone who comes primarily from the women's movement. The Quebec women's movement is against the deal too.  Jaffer: So what about the 'good' stuff in the deal—what about the distinct society gains  for Quebec and Aboriginal rights and self-government?  Rebick: WeU, we support distinct society but we don't think there's enough in the deal  for Quebec. That's one of the reasons there's so much opposition to it in Quebec. As for  Aboriginal self-government, we support it and that was certainly a big factor. But the deal  doesn't protect the rights of Aboriginal women and the Aboriginal self-government package is tainted for that reason. And Aboriginal women, have come out against the deal.  So even though we support Aboriginal setf-government and think it's the only thing reaUy worth supporting in the agreement, it wasn't enough to override our behef that the  agreement sets back the clock as far as women's rights and social programs go.  See Day page 12  See Rebick page 13  KINESIS Day from page 11  Day: Yes. And there may not be criteria because there's no process for establishing it.  So BC or Alberta could take the money and put it into a kind of chUdcare program that  doesn't reflect what women beUeve ought to happen. Instead of a public program, maybe  it wUl be private babysitting services that wUl be called chUdcare. This could be said to  meet a "national objective" of providing for chUdcare..  Brown: And the second reason?  Day: Because provinces can opt out with compensation, there is a lack of incentive for  the federal government to start a chUdcare or any other national program. It is the richer  provinces that have the doUars to opt out and set up their own programs using the federal money. So this leaves the federal government running national programs in poorer  provinces that haven't got the funds or the infrastructure to support a program of their  own. The federal government wUl get credit from a far smaller segment of the population  so what's the incentive for them.  Brown: You mean, if the big votes from Ontario and Quebec aren't there, then what's  to gain?  Day: Exactly.  Brown: The devolution process gives the provinces new powers in key pohcy areas such  as labour market training—something NAC says wUl have a very serious effect on racial  minorities and people with disabiUties in particular.  Day: Women and disabled people and racial minorities have just gotten a place on Canadian Labour Force Development Board so they have input on how labour market training should address their needs. If this is devolved to the provinces, then aU groups must  try, province by province, to make sure there's some kind of standard for their inclusion so  that their training concerns, including more ESL programs, are addressed.  Brown: NAC also says this deal poses a serious threat to women's equahty rights. How  Day: In the 1982 constitutional talks we got a among others, Charter of Rights and  Freedoms with an open-worded equahty guarantee (Section 15) that covers women, racial  minorities people with disabihties, and, the courts have told us, lesbians and gays, although  they aren't specificaUy named. We also won section 28, which is a clause used by the courts  to interpret all sections of the Charter that say rights and freedoms are guaranteed equaUy  to male and female persons. It's a separate sex equahty guarantee.  Brown: And protecting Section 28 from the 'notwithstanding' override clause was part  of an Uth hour fight in 1982?  Day: Yes. At the end of that constitutional round, pohticians came up with the 'notwithstanding' clause (section 33) that allows governments to override charter rights with legislation that can stand for five years and be renewed if desired. There was a big last-minute  fight to remove the application of Section 33 to 28.  But reaUy, everything we got was a fight. Women had to fight through committee hearings and do a great deal of lobbying to get the wording that went into sections 15 and 28.  Now we're seeing a clawback of those rights.  Brown: So how are equahty rights in sections 15 and 28 threatened?  Day: We have a new section of the Charter caUed the Canada clause [Section 2] which  is a new substantive clause that tells us the fundamental values of the country. It modifies  aU the rights and freedoms in the Charter.  Brown: And these fundamental values include?  Day: That we are a parliamentary democracy, that provinces are equal, that Aboriginal people have their own culture and societies and are a third order of government, that  Quebec is a distinct society in Canada, that we're commited to the vitality and development of official language minorities, and that we beheve in racial and ethnic equahty and  the equahty of female and male persons.  Brown: But the counter-argument goes, U the fundamental characteristics include that  Canadians beheve in racial and ethnic equahty and the equahty of female and male persons, then what's the problem? We're all covered, right?  Day: No. Women with disabihties and lesbians are left out. So are older women and chUdren who are protected in Section 15 by a prohibition against discrimination based on age.  Section two leaves out those covered by the open-ended language in Section 15 and creates  a hierarchy of rights that downgrades the rights of those not named in section two. The  fundamental characteristics of Canada wUl be considered more important by the courts.  Another serious problem is that there are obvious differences in the language of the  Canada Clause in different paragraphs. It says "Canadians and their governments are committed to" official language minorities, but only that "Canadians are committed to" racial  and gender equahty. The word government is left out. Courts wUl read that to mean government has a responsibihty in areas of official language but not in terms of racial and  gender equahty.  Brown: So how does this aU affect a chaUenge to the Charter?  Day; The Charter is structured so that, if we say a law violates women's equahty guarantees under Section 15, the courts look at the section to see if there's a violation. If they  agree, they go to Section 1 of the Charter to see if it is a reasonable limit on a right that's  demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.  Brown: Because in law, some discrimination is justified?  Day: Yes. Now if this deal goes through, the courts must also go to the Canada Clause  to determine if a restriction on rights is justifiable according to the fundamental characteristics of Canada. And those fundamental characteristics do not include equity for some  groups covered by section 15—lesbians and gays, older people and people with disabihties. And the language in the clause doesn't say government has a specific responsibiUty in  these areas. This means that it wUl be easier to justify Unfits in the rights of these groups.  Brown: So women are being told to trust in this deal, and to stop quibbling over a few  words when, in fact, it's the words or rather, the lack of words, that threatens equahty  rights?  Day: Absolutely. We're told everyone has to compromise, there wUl be some things  everyone doesn't hke. I beheve what's happening here is a serious assault on rights that  women and other groups fought so hard to win and maintain. The fact that the charter has  given groups a way to challenge government pohcy and laws has reaUy raised the hackles  of legislators. They don't hke it.  iHD WOMEN AND  rUTION THE CONSTITUTION  " on 7.^n»m punday, September 20, 7:30pm  1 j       iL«F,L»«i  pus(VCC)  Ktway  USSfiast Broadway  WOMEN AND  THE CONSTITUTION  uncfay, Sept* :30pn  WOMEN AND  THE CONSTITUTION  WOMEN AND  THE i IQt*  .Ll;,K,    ■-. .........

Day: I think that's further evidence of the clawback. The program wUl shut its doors on  September 30 and when it does, women and other groups wUl have no access to use of the  rights we won in 1982. We won't have the resources to challenge violations of the Charter.  Brown: NAC is also unhappy with the lack of recognition of concerns presented by Native women's organizations, hke the Native Women's Association of Canada.  Day: For the first time, Aboriginal leaders have been included in the process, but Aboriginal women, such as the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC), have not.  [NWAC] is saying that the constitution must make clear that Aboriginal governments are  bound to equahty guarantees in the Charter for Aboriginal women.  This is important because Aboriginal women are in a legaUy different position than non-  native women. H Aboriginal women's equahty rights in the charter do not apply to Aboriginal governments, then Native women are left without a legal remedy. They cannot launch  an equahty rights challenge via the Canadian Human Rights Act because the Act is specificaUy written to say it does not apply to decisions made by band councils. At the moment, the language in the deal is very tricky. While the Charter is said to apply to Aboriginal governments, a non-derogate clause has been added that in essence aUows complete  circumvention of the Charter.  Brown: Like many organizations, NAC sees this deal as part of a corporate agenda that  has given us gems hke the Canada/US free trade agreement and now the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—both of which also threaten social programs and equality rights.  Day: First, we have a federal government that is not committed to national social programs anyway and has been anxious to get out of them. We've seen this in the cap on the  Canada Assistance Plan, for example. This is a government that has been backing away  from its role in national social programs. But this deal entrenches that perspective. No  matter what federal government comes afterwards, this deal wUl make social programs in  Canada outside of Quebec harder to obtain.  It fits very weU with the conservative economic goal which is to to put more power in the  hands of corporations and more trust in the notion of a free market. We're being locked  into the free market ideology with the free trade deals, and this constitutional piece meshes  with that agenda H there is less coherence in terms of social programs, then provinces,  one by one, are more vulnerable to pressures to cut social regulations to provinces, a more  favorable chmate for business.  Brown: So provinces wUl be pressured into reducing social programs in order to attract  business and industry?  Day: They'U be pressured to deregulate social programs that are costly to corporations.  It's better for business, for example, if they aren't restricted in what they can pay women  by such things as pay-equity programs.  Brown: NAC and other groups really have their work cut out for them, considering  the money the federal government and other organizations who want the Yes vote wUl be  spending.  Day: The referendum process is not a pohtical process I respect. There are no spending  limits, so businesses can pour money in. NAC and other women's organizations who have  important things to say wiU have a hard time keeping their voices from being drowned out.  But we've got to do the best we can to get the information out to women.  Rebick from page 11  Jaffer: What about the right-wing No? Was that a consideration in NAC's executive  decision?  Rebick: Oh sure we thought about the issue of being on the same side as Preston Manning [leader of the Reform party]. But we made it clear right from the outset, and I think  it's coming across clearly in the media, we wUl not work with the Reform party. We wUl not  work with anyone who doesn't support distinct society, Aboriginal self-government and minority Unguistic rights. Our No-campaign is a progressive No-campaign. It is 'yes' to those  things and 'no' to the deal. I don't think anybody's confusing us with Preston Manning.  H anything, by our presence in the campaign, it means that a No-vote can't be interpreted in Quebec as an anti-Quebec vote because our support for Quebec's rights is weU  known in Quebec. Also we have women representing us in Quebec, and because we'U be  working with the Quebec women's movement, not directly, but in communication with  them. Also, by the presence of women on the No side, the presence of the progressives on  the no side, a No-vote won't be interpreted as an anti-Quebec vote in Quebec.  .if we can  Jackie Brown is a r  r contributor to Kinesis.  mount an effective opposition, they'll never be  able to ignore the women's movement again."  -Judy Rebick  Jaffer: What do you think wUl happen if the deal is brought down?  Rebick: First of aU, we think there'll be a federal election because we think the Tories  wUl have to resign if this deal goes down. We beheve that will be a positive thing.  Also, we think the constitutional wranghng isn't going to be over whether the deal is  agreed to or not because the deal itself has over 50 elements that the first ministers are going to continue to negotiate on. Whether or not the deal is agreed, there wUl be continual  constitutional wrangUng.  We would argue that there should be a separate agreement with Aboriginal people for  Aboriginal self-government, because it's not contingent on other parts of the deal. There  is agreement on the substantive [self-government] package and we would hope that Aboriginal women would be included this time and that there would be a separate agreement  signed there.  Then, what we would argue is that the message of the deal be brought down. The message is that this ehtist way of amending the constitution doesn't work. They've tried it  twice now and both times it's faUed.  The issue is how do we get a better deal next time? What we'd hke to see is a constituent  assembly. They wUl have to bring the people into the amending process. And the way to  do that is through a constituent assembly, where people from different parts of the country can listen to each other, and people from the rest of Canada can understand what the  demands of Quebec are, and people in Quebec can understand where western Canada is at.  The process that happened at the constitutional conferences was people coming in with  their regional hats on and leaving understanding what people from other regions, wanted  and therefore being able to come to a consensus. [This] could happen on a grander scale  in a constituent assembly. The only thing that's going to stop the constitutional wranghng  is for people to understand the interests of the other parts of the country. Not to mention  those of women and minorities, and so on.  Jaffer: And what wUl NAC's strategy be if the outcome of the referendum is Yes to the  deal?  Rebick: H it's yes, we'll do two things. We'U accept it—that's the vote. But we'U lobby  to get as many provinces as possible to have a gender-equity and minority-representation  senate. And we'll make chUdcare a central issue in the federal election campaign. H they  debate us, saying that chUdcare's not threatened, then we want to make damn sure we get  commitments on chUdcare.  The other thing is, if we can mount an effective opposition, they'll never be able to ignore the women's movement again. They basicaUy ignored us this time. They pretended  to consult with us. Not only did they not accept what we were saying—for example about  the Canada clause—but from the start of the consultation process to the end, we moved  backwards, not forwards. Rejecting a proportional representation senate is an example of  that. The Canada clause is an example.

OveraU, in the course of the consultation, women  moved backward, not forward. And I think if we now can affect women's opposition to  this, they won't be able to ignore the women's movement again, whatever future process  happens.  Jaffer: What's NAC doing now? How are you campaigning for No?  Rebick: When is Kinesis coming out?  Jaffer: Soon. But apart from media coverage, what's NAC's strategy and what can  women do to get involved?  Rebick: What women can do, first of aU, is work with us. I'm sure there'U be organizing meetings across the country. We're trying to get a core of organizers and a broader  group of volunteers to work with us. We can't do electoral work—we don't have an electoral machine—so we're not going door to door or anything. But we want to make sure  there are women at every pubhc event to raise the issues.  Our focus is raising the issues, making [the Yes-campaigners] answer us on the issues.  It's not so much that we're going to campaign for a No. WeU, we are, but we want to make  sure that these issues are debated. And if in the course of that debate we're convinced  we're wrong, we'U change our position.  NAC can do training of women who want to do this, to have women ask the hard questions, to make sure that NAC or women working with us are on the platform at these  meetings and that we represent the No side.  We're going to have two events right across the country. On September 30, the day the  court chaUenges program is being canceUed, we're going to organize actions to protest the  program being canceUed, focusing on the Canada clause and the threats to the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms in the Canada clause.  And on October 18—Persons Day—there wUl be demonstrations across the country for  'yes to equahty, no to the deal.' We'U mobUize in the streets. There wUl also be a big pubhc meeting in BC, closer to the date of the referendum.

Her family left Korea when she was  seven and she had very few memories of the  short time she hved there. In fact, she had  almost no memory of her Ufe between the  ages of four to seven, although, prior to her  trip to Korea, she had begun to have nightmares about being sexuaUy abused.  The youngest of three sisters, Susan and  one of her older sisters were bulimic in their  teens. When Susan went to Korea, she had  her bulimia under control. She was planning  to stay in Korea for the summer to study  and get reacquainted with her Korean relatives.  Perhaps it was the environment that  brought back the memories—the famiUar  faces of Korean people, the smells, the  sounds. Susan says it was probably being  in the setting in which she spent the first  seven years of her Ufe that brought back the  painful experiences of her chUdhood.  Susan beheves she was sexuaUy abused  by one of her older male cousins and perhaps an uncle. She isn't certain but, when  she met them again, she felt extremely uncomfortable with the way they were affectionate with her, even beginning to tremble when she was with them. Though she  had never before spoken about it to anyone, she was overwhelmed by the intensity  of her emotions and turned for support to a  friend she met at the school where she was  studying Korean. However, she knew when  she left Korea, the healing would have to  continue when she got back home.  Back in North America, her bulimia  returned—she started the endless cycle of  binging and purging again. She often considered suicide. She told very few people  about her pain, partly because she feared  bringing shame to her famUy, and partly because she feared not being beheved.  "The experience of sexual abuse affects  aU areas of a woman's Ufe. It often results in  emotional instabUity, low self-esteem, and a  sense of shame," says Peggy Chan, a famUy therapist at FamUy Services of Greater  Vancouver. She adds that some people in  the Chinese-Canadian community do not  beUeve sexual abuse happens.  "In Chinese culture, more emphasis is  placed on morals and distance between people. Our culture also values the controlling  of one's emotions and sexual desire," says  Chan.  Denial of the existence of chUd sexual  abuse in society can often painfuUy lengthen  the healing process for survivors. As Chan  puts it, "in Chinese-Canadian famiUes, issues of sexual abuse are often kept sUent for  \ *±/      Art Emi  Vancouver's Lesbian  and Gay Bookstore  Open Daily 10am till 11pm  New Fall Arrivals  RR VOL UTION No matter how hard  she tries, heroine  OF Ellen Buins wiU  never be Scarlett  LITTLE GIRLS O'Hara.

The survivors of  sexual abuse keep it inside and many women  feel that it is their fault."  Susan began to attend group therapy for  women, acknowledging that, whUe she was  not yet ready to share her story, she needed  to hear those of other survivors in order to  beheve she was not alone. She began to realize that she wasn't alone with her experience of sexual abuse. She is not the only  woman of colour survivor of sexual abuse,  and sexual abuse is not a North American  phenomenon—Susan is one of many women  of colour beginning to talk about experiences of sexual abuse aU over the world.  But women of colour who face the challenge of surviving chUd sexual abuse must  also confront other barriers. Laura is a  Chinese-Canadian lesbian and a survivor  of sexual abuse. Being a lesbian is not related to Laura's experiences of sexual abuse.  However, being a lesbian woman of colour  is yet another issue she has to deal with.  Laura began seeing a private therapist  and attended two groups for women survivors of sexual abuse. Her experiences in  the groups, Laura says, "were difficult, because I was the only women of colour. I felt  hke I didn't fit in because everyone else was  white."  Laura says her defenses were up a lot in  the groups of white women survivors because of her experiences with racism in society and, less overtly, with group members. She feels she became an easy target for  scapegoating, and racist attitudes she encountered added to the oppression she felt  as a survivor of sexual abuse.  "It affected my seU-esteem ... [so I] feel  I'm never good enough," she says. Laura  says that the sUencing she experienced in  the groups meant that, rather than challenging some of the ways things were done,  she tended to go along with them.  "It's difficult being the only woman of  colour faced with racism in a group of white  women. As weU, the racist attitudes in society towards Chinese women—being submissive and passive— perpetuates the sUencing," she adds.  And when racism is tied in with the  abuse—Laura was sexuaUy abused by someone white—it adds a further dimension of  self- hate and denial of one's culture "because the abuser abused me for being Chinese," says Laura. "There was a lot of trust  and authority in the relationship. It feels  hke a double whammy."  For now, Laura is working on her healing by sharing her experiences with others and learning to allow herself to connect  with others. She says she wants to just be  herself and make her own decisions. She is  also learning to appreciate aspects of Chinese culture she had been taught to hate.  She continues to see a therapist, but she  is also learning to take care of herself by  creating a supportive social network, doing  things she enjoys, and having positive things  in different parts of her hfe.  She and other women of colour with  shared experiences continue to work towards a safe environment to talk about their  own experiences of racism and sexual abuse.  "As women of colour, we don't have any hterature avaUable to meet our needs.  "Our needs are separate from those of  white women," says Laura. "We need to create our own healing."

L4 KINESIS ////////////////////^^^^^  ///////////////////////////^^^^  Arts  Review and interview:  Psst. Did you know...?  by Kathleen Oliver  PINK SMOKE IN THE VATICAN:  The Mystery of Pope Joan  SHOOT THE WOMEN FIRST  Foursight Theatre Company, UK  September 10-20, 1992  England's Foursight Theatre Company  specializes in women's stories, but the  women they choose to portray—a female  chUd abuser, Hitler's lover Eva Braun, female terrorists—are not obvious candidates  for feminist role models.  "We're looking at the whole female psyche," says Foursight's Kate Hale, "and that  includes the darker areas. By exploring  those areas that nobody wants to look at, we  challenge ourselves more and hope to challenge other people."  Among the most challenging, provocative, and weU-acted works at this year's  Fringe Festival are Foursight's stage biographies of the legendary ninth-century Pope  Joan in Pink Smoke in the Vatican and  German Red Army Faction members Ulrike  Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin in Shoot the  Women First.  Pink Smoke and Shoot, both directed  by Hale, fit weU into what has become Four-  sight's mandate—redressing the balance of  history by presenting it through women's  eyes.  Group members Hale, Naomi Cooke, and  JiU Dowse had no intention of setting tip as  a women's theatre company when they met  at Exeter University more than six years  ago. But they found themselves being labeUed that way, and quickly decided to create their own pigeonhole before someone  else made it for them.  Their staunch behef that every issue is  a women's issue has given them a wide  scope for their brand of biographical theatre, which has portrayed women as diverse  as Mae West, Eva Braun, and Helen of Troy.  The members of Foursight admit they  love gossip, so rumours are often the starting points for their plays. In the case of Pink  Smoke, it was a rumour that Pope Joan  herself never knew she was a woman that led  the company to research her Ufe and buUd  the play around it.  The result is a superbly crafted and moving story. We see the young Joanna digging her father's grave'and then putting on  his clothes, as they are aU that he has left  her. "I wanted to climb inside my Dad," she  says. "It made me feel secure. I wanted to  keep him aUve." She picks up the theological career he had abandoned for fanuly Ufe,  and becomes such a talented preacher that,  dressed- as a man, she goes aU the way to  the Vatican.  According to historical legend, Pope  John XIII (Joanna) was stoned to death  when she gave birth whUe in procession. As  Joanna, Naomi Cooke fleshes out the story  with a briUiant and deeply moving characterization of the woman and her faith.  Cooke's remarkably expressive face Ughts  up the stage whether she's eating a cream-  puff or preaching a sermon. Joanna comes  ahve as a character because she exists in  the glory of her contradictions. The tension  between appearance and reaUty in terms of  Joanna's gender is merely the superficial expression of a host of other tensions: between  simple faith and elaborate church ritual, between love and obedience, between God and  the devU.  The coUaboration between Cooke, a devout Christian, and Hale, a self-described  "devout atheist," results in a delightful balance of reverence and absurdist understatement. At one point, Joanna says simply,  "It's funny being a pregnant pope." And  later: "I know the theology is weak, but it  makes me laugh."  Did Pope Joan ever reaUy exist? More  important, says Cooke, is that she should  have. In either case, she comes ahve in this  marveUous production.  WhUe fleshing out the hfe of an elusive medieval legend had its chaUenges,  there were different obstacles to the creation  of Shoot the Women First. Here, there  was no shortage of biographical detaU: the  Baader-Meinhof gang were active in Germany just over twenty years ago. What was  more challenging was to find a way to approach a subject so instantly repulsive to  many people.  Dowse, who plays Gudrun Ensshn, recalls her own initial distaste at the idea of  doing a show about women terrorists. But  when she looked more closely, she was both  amazed and intrigued to find the terrorism  evolving from student activism with a left-  wing, pacifist, Christian perspective. What  she found compelling was the journey from  that perspective to one that would advocate  violence to effect change.  "Terrorists tend to be treated as monsters [in the West], not as real people," says  Cooke, "and most people wiU continue to  think of them as monsters untU they stop  being terrorists. It's important to try to understand them as real people instead of just  dismissing them."  "UsuaUy these people are aware of the  monstrosity of what they're doing," adds  Hale, "but see it as less monstrous than  what they're protesting against." She points  out the bias in the way we describe 'terrorists' as opposed to the euphemisms we come  up with for state-sanctioned wars, such as  'the troubles' in Ireland.  In the case of Gudrun Ensslin and Ulrike  Meinhof, the progression from civU protest  to violence is neither simple nor straightforward. As schoolchUdren, these women were  shown films of the Nazi holocaust, and inherited the guUt of their parents' generation  for having aUowed the genocide to happen.  "It's important to try to understand  [terrorists] as real people instead of just  dismissing them."  -Naomi Cooke  Naomi Cooke and Jill Dowse in  Shoot the Women First  When they saw simUar crimes being perpetrated in Vietnam, they graduaUy moved  from peaceful protest to organized actions  against the state. Although the Baader-  Meinhof group was officiaUy terrorist, many  German citizens supported their actions.  Meinhof's struggle is particularly complex, as Ensslin tries to convince her that  she must abandon her twin daughters in order to dedicate herseU fuUy to the cause.  WhUe Meinhof (played by Cooke) is the  deeper thinker and essentially the architect  of the movement's phUosophy, Ensshn is far  less reluctant to translate the theory into  practice, and her unwavering adherence to  dogma is chUling. Meinhof wrestles with the  gap between theory and practice: "I know  the argument—I wrote it. But I can't bear  to leave my httle Ufe."  Once persuaded to do so, Meinhof is seduced by the celebrity status of her position.  Already 'the darling of the left,' she now  backs' up her words with actions and becomes a cult figure. This 'rock star-terrorist  status' is explored within the play, Underscored by the Pop Art-influenced set and  pointed bits of pantomime done to hit pop  . songs from the era  Shoot the Women First is textuaUy  dense, stylisticaUy complex, and poUticaUy  chaUenging. There are flashes of grim humour, and deeply moving moments in which  we see the women in aU their human contradictions. But the play is predominantly  an inteUectual experience that forces you to  examine your beliefs and convictions.  For Hale, a direct result of working  this show has been that "I can no longer  comfortably caU myself a pacifist. Pacifism  means aUowing other people's violence to  continue." Perhaps the greatest lesson to  be learned from the Baader-Meinhof story,  says Hale, is that those in power should  take peaceful demonstrations incredibly seriously and respond to the demands of civU  protesters. After all, it was frustration with  the lack of response to peaceful efforts at  protest that led the Baader- Meinhof group  to turn to violence.  So what's next for Foursight? Cooke wiU  . be spending the coming year in Canada,  working on a simple, gentle story of love between women, whUe Dowse and Hale are already eagerly researching another rumour—  that Queen Elizabeth I, the 'Virgin Queen,'  secretly had two sons. The play, tentatively titled Bloody Mary and the Virgin Queen, wiU also look at Mary, Queen  of Scots, and should be ready in time for  next year's Fringe.

KINESIS Reviews: three Fringe plays:  Feminist wit and cynicism  by Kathleen Oliver  POCHSY'S LIPS  Written   by   Karen   Hines   and   Sandra  Balcovske  Directed by Sandra Balcovske  Pochsy is in the hospital, but she's making the best of it. She sends herself very  loving get-weU cards. She sings songs, she  dances with her IV unit, she dreams of the  perfect romance—perhaps with Dr. Cah-  gari, who keeps giving her aU these tests,  surely a sign that he's interested in her.  Despite her good cheer, Pochsy (pronounced 'poxy,' as in germ-infested) knows  that "we hve in a scary time." Karen Hines  is briUiant as the terminally cute Pochsy, a  sort of ingenue savant who has the world  aU figured out for everyone from refugees—  "Dream great dreams and let them come  true! Set a goal, make a plan, write it  down!"—to God—"Success is an attitude,  Lord, get yours right"—but can't quite cope  with the fact that she's dying.  Karen Hines as Pochsy  in Pochsy's Lips  Pochsy is both sweet and poisonous, hke  the grapes she sprays before eating them—  "just in case bugs, you know." Hines, who  directs Fringe favourites Mump and Smoot,  spent part of last year studying bouffon,  a form of clowning originating in medieval  France. The early bouffon practitioners  were peasants who were sent to hve in the  swamps and brought to court once a year  Sensible Footwear indeed!  to entertain the ruhng class. The result was  comedy with a very sweet exterior concealing the daggers underneath.  Poschy's daggers are aimed at environmental ruin and faithlessness, the sustainers  of "a species bent on our seU-extinction."  EasUy the standout of this year's Fringe,  Pochsy's Lips is a virtuaUy flawless piece  of theatre that leaves you awed by Hines'  dexterity and chUled by the twee cynicism  and perceptiveness of her message: "Everything's falling apart, but everyone's falling  in love."  THE HOUSE OF AGNES  Written and performed by  Jackie Crossland and Nora RandaU  Collateral Damage: The Tragedy of  Medea, last year's Fringe entry from Random Acts, was an overly ambitious project  that didn't quite achieve what it set out to  do. This year, locals Jackie Crossland and  Nora RandaU have wisely returned to storytelling, and the simple format they employ  is fundamental to their success.  The House- of Agnes tells the stories  of four lesbians, three of them played by  Crossland. Agnes is a sweet but somewhat  nosy dyke who rents out the rest of her  "quiet" house. Mavis, played by RandaU, is  her somewhat curmudgeonly basement tenant. When the upstairs tenant, punk rocker  Mary, leaves, Liza the Lone Lezzie moves in.  Liza is a space cadet (honest) who, despite numerous crushes, has decided she  prefers being single so she'U be ready if the  aliens ever decide to take her back to outer  space. Liza tries to convey some of this to  Mavis, who would rather be left to her gardening and to steadfastly refusing to open  letters from her ex-lover Jude, a recovering  alcoholic.  The women open up to each other as the  stories unfold, and they ultimately come to  a new understanding of their parts in one  another's hves. Sprinkled with lots of warm  jabs at the intricate idiosyncracies of contemporary dyke culture, this is a sweet, unpretentious and affecting work from Vancouver's primo lesbian storyteUers.  SENSIBLE FOOTWEAR MAKE OUT  Written and performed by Alex DaUas,  Alison Field and Wendy Vousden  How can you not love Sensible Footwear?  "H you ever espouse any opinions other  than those of a doormat, you're a feminist. If you don't shave your underarms,  you're practically a member of the Baader-  Meinhof group."  With those words and a proud display  of hairy pits, Alex Dallas, Alison Field  and Wendy Vousden—coUectively known  as Sensible Footwear—kick mto their usual  brand of biting feminist wit.  This time the territory is the homefront,  and the Footwear folks are full of practical  advice on everything from how to entertain  unexpected guests when there's nothing in  the fridge but crusty cheese and diet Coke  (did you know that pantyhose made excellent soup stock?) to calling up the Jehovah's]  Witnesses for help when you've got a spider  in the bathtub.  In between they run through aU the  dUemmas a modern woman might face.  There's coping with being single: "If you're)  looking for a place to hve or a new job, people don't say, 'Stop looking. Something wUl  come along'." Or being pregnant and having friends ask you if it was planned: "No,  I accidentaUy feU on a turkey baster full of |  sperm."  Career planning? "We recommend zoo-  keeping for any lesbians out there looking  for a partner. Don't ask why, just try it."  These women have a quick, hUarious answer for everything, and they're not afraid  to tackle 'unmentionables' hke pap smears,  menstruation, genitaUa, itching, etcetera.  And if hairy armpits make them terrorists,  then you may as weU give in now and die  laughing.

Crossland, a  Vancouver-based performer, playwright and  director, creates theatre that is femimst and  community-based, focusing in particular on  lesbians and working women. She is also  'one half of a feminist theatrical company,  Random Acts.  When I went for my audition, I didn't  know much about Crossland or Random  Acts. I had seen her and partner Nora  RandaU perform their "Coffee Break Characters" at various events around the city.  Their characters, both lesbian and straight,  teU stories about their Uves as working  women. They include a waitress, a fish-  factory worker and a school bus driver.  I found their renditions entertaining and  funny and was expecting the audition to be  nothing short of interesting.  What I found was a unique experience in  acting. The audition was based on improvisation and ensemble work. "Okay, I can handle this," I thought when we were asked to  create a human machine with not-so-human  sounds and movement. Tossing my reservations about flaHness to the wind, I threw  myself into it. It turned out to be an interesting exercise, with people moving toward  integration of movement and sound. It was  also essential for the play because, as an ensemble within it, we created a wonderfuUy  bitchy and sardonic dragon.  The audition also included reading from  the script, but I got the impression Jackie  was mostly interested in how we got along  and how we worked together. A few days  later, she caUed to say she had decided to  involve everyone who had auditioned for the  play. It seems she just couldn't decide—  she said she thought we were aU great and  should aU be included.  At first, I was a Uttle frustrated. I have  become used to the competitiveness of auditions, of scrambling to read better than  anyone else to get the part I want. I wanted  Crossland to teU me I was good and thai  I deserved a decent part. Instead, I found  myself asked to take on the responsibiUty of  deciding what I was comfortable with and  capable of doing. It was a difficult concept  for me to wrap my mind around.  As I became more involved with the production, I became aware of the distinct personal style and phUosophy Crossland incorporates her directing. Most directors tend  to have their own vision in defining characters, interpreting scripts and an actor has  to take on that artistic expression, whether  or not she agrees with it. Jackie was different. She was clearly able to direct without  having to control, to Usten to the actor's  ideas, and change things when someone was  having a problem. She truly beheved in an  actor's ahiUty and intuition. I found this  pretty amazing—this abiUty to let go of control in a manner that aUowed space for disagreement and change, even when it contradicted her vision of the play.  Tasked Crossland why she chose this particular style of directing:  Jackie Crossland: My involvement in  community theatre taught me the difference  between articulating your own individual  artistic vision as a director—which is fine—  and this other wonderful thing you can do-  let something bubble up from a community  and create itself in a way.  Random Acts is a feminist story-teUing  company. Our phUosophy has feminist  roots—what thai means is, we look for ways  of creating theatre that has to do with inclusion and connecting with people. We try to  include everyone who wants to be involved.  Rosanne: When you both write and direct, is it harder to resist the temptation to  be authoritarian?  Jackie: As a writer and a director, I  know that if an actor decides, 'this is death,  this is not going to work' and you go against  that and say 'do it because I say so,' they're  not going to do it the way you want anyway. Maybe you think they're going to, but  they're not. And furthermore, they're going  to hate you for being an asshole.  It's not hard for me to beUeve that people are going to work for the best. They  want a good show—nobody wants to be in a  honker. I'm an actor and I know that torn  experience.  "I've had to bite  my tongue and say  'fine' and then gone  and chewed the paint  off some wall."  - Crossland  Rosanne: What if you seriously disagree? If you beUeve what you've written  is essential to the context of the play and  someone refuses to do it?  Jackie: That's happened. I've had to  bite my tongue and say 'fine' and then gone  and chewed the paint off some wall. You get  pissed off but if you have a good bunch of  people, at some point the reason wUl emerge  why that thing should or shouldn't have  been there. You just can't make people do  what they don't want to do unless you're  prepared to torture and kill them or something.  Rosanne: Have you ever had a show fall  apart because you aUowed an individual to  change a piece against your better judgement?  Jackie: No, but I've often seen things I  wish were different. But I'm a writer and,  if you reaUy Uke something, you can save it  and use it somewhere else. Sooner or later  I'U find some actor who wants to say those  hnes.  Rosanne: TeU me some more about Random Acts. How did it start? What's it hke  working with Nora?  Jackie: Nora and I got together in 1987.  Nora's a short-story writer and she came  to me for some advice on how to improve  her reading skiUs. I went to one of her readings, "Mavis TeUs the Story of Marlene and  the Chicken Yard," and found it a very  funny, insightful piece of material. Before I  met Nora, I had been developing an interest in story telling, wondering how it works  in communities, for people in ways that are  different than theatre. So it was a natural  step to get together with Nora  Crossland in action  Jackie: One of the things I've learned is,  you should never name the weU from which  you drink. I Uke and understand many different kinds of theatre. I've worked in professional theatre for years—I was probably  among the first professional women directors in the country. But I feel very comfortable working, from a community base because I get a chance to work with people  who are generating material out of a concern for the same kind of subject matter or  the same issues. That nurtures me—I feel  reaUy good there.  Rosanne: What directions do you see  yourself going in now? What are you most  interested in doing?  Jackie: What I'm always most interested  in is the current project I'm doing. Some-  c   times that presents problems because of the  ■jj   'profile' thing—I tend to be involved with  J  the project I'm doing and not so much with  2.  how I'm presenting myself to the world,  ■a   And then I get annoyed when it's not to-  jf   taUy appreciated. I know there's an incon-  [a. sistency and conflict there, but as Goethe  said, "Consistency is the hobgoblin of smaU  minds."  It worked weU. We formed Random Acts  shortly afterward and have been working together ever since. We've done some plays,  but primarily we do stories. UntU recently,  we'd write stories as individuals and then  decide who's going to teU them. With The  House of Agnes [this year's Fringe production], we're starting to write together.  Rosanne: What about your own personal artistic style?  Jackie: GeneraUy, Nora and I have experienced that the stuff we do together has  a much greater impact than any of the  stuff we do as individuals. Working together  sparks a thing that's greater than the whole.  We love working together and, even though  there are some problems, the things we do  please us and please our audiences. It's been  a great thing for both of us, this Uttle company. We've thought a great deal about how  to make it work.  Rosanne: Do you have any specific goals  in theatre or Random Acts, or do you see it  as being att open-ended?  . Jackie: It's aU pretty-open ended, but I  have a couple of writing things I want to  do. Nora and I want to start performing together, something we've never reaUy done.  We're trying a bit of that in The House of  Agnes. This might even mean working with  another director at some point.  Rosanne: Are there other directors who  would work Uke you do?  Jackie: Sure there are. Random Acts is  not unique or isolated. This year we went to  the Women in View Festival [in Vancouver]  and there were many wonderful and profound pieces there, many women we would  be thrilled to work with. Shows Uke, Light  on Their Feet, Canadian Tango, Man  on the Moon—Woman on the Pill, and  The Strength of Indian Women. These  are just some examples of works that have a  community base and are a profound expression of their communal identities. It's inspiring for us to see them and it's clear that  there are lots of possibiUties to make contact with other people who are doing similar or complementary work.  Rosanne: Are there things about mainstream theatre that you stUl find useful or  might find useful at some point?  "One of the things  I've learned is, you  should never name  the well from which  you drink."  - Crossland  Where I am is where I want to be; I'm  here by choice. My focus is to do the work  I want to do. I also want to have fun doing it. ActuaUy, it goes back to when I was  seeing a psychiatrist 20 years ago and was  asked if I thought I was good at what I do.  I thought, yes, I am good at what I do. The  important thing for me is that I'm able to  keep working in a way that I find satisfying  and interesting and that I have a good time  doing it. That's what it's aU about for me. I  don't want to have to compete for the privUege of working—I want to do my work. So,  I kind of found, through that question, the  core of what I'm about.  Jackie Crossland has worked in professional theatre, television and film, in  episodes of The Beachcombers and Leo &  Me and the Robert Altmanfilm, McCabe  and Mrs. MiUer. She's held principal roles  in various CBC radio productions and  been involved with many professional  theatre companies in Toronto and Vancouver. She's worked as a script writer  and playwright. Her most recent play,  CoUateral Damage: The Tragedy of Medea,  is being published by Press Gang in the  Fall.    Rosanne Johnson is a student at An-  tioch University (Seattle), completing a  Liberal Arts degree which requires writing about literature and theatre.  KINESIS ;asss$s***s***sss^^  ARTS  Review: Canadian Women Making Music:  A much-needed resource  CANADIAN WOMEN  MAKING MUSIC  By Linda Kivi  Green Dragon Press  by Jennifer Catchpole  Why write a book about Canadian  women's music? Because there isn't one.  The writer, K. Linda Kivi, became interested in the subject after attending the First  Canadian Women's Music and Cultural Festival in 1984. She then went to the library  to dig up some information on Canadian  woman and music and found very httle.  As Kivi writes in the preface to Canadian Women Making Music, "surely  there were women musicians before the  1960s, I thought to myself, ... As far  as Canadian women in music were concerned, past and present seemed to wander  in the same information vacuum ... Did  women not compose, write songs, play instruments, and generaUy participate in the  wider sphere of music?" And so, Kivi set  out to correct this oversight.  The result is Canadian Women Making Music, an oversized softcover book  sprinkled with fascinating black and white  photographs. The book is divided into two  parts. The first deals with a history, from  confederation to the present, of women's involvement in the Canadian music industry,  garnered from whatever resources the author could find.  The information is rooted in a feminist  social analysis of the influences on Canadian  women not to make music at all, or be sandwiched in narrow categories—that is, to be  an opera singer was acceptable, to be a fe-  Portion of a women's sextet  male composer was not. The writing style is  non-academic and easy to read, although in  spots it seemed generalized, no doubt due  the dearth of sources.  The second part of the book, "Voices  Clear and Strong," focuses on the women  themselves, in the form of in-depth interviews with 17 contemporary Canadian  women musicians. It is as culturaUy and  musicaUy diverse a selection as could be  hoped for, including interviews with Salome  Bey, Heather Bishop, Marie-Lynn Hammond, and members of Katari Taiko. The  author gives these women the space to teU  their own stories.  Several recurring themes run through the  interviews. Many of the women talk about  the difficulty of trying to make a Uving as a  woman in a male-dominated industry, and  about the compUcations of trying to raise  chUdren and have a career at the same time.  AU talk about basing their music in pohtical  and spiritual beUefs, about music as a tool  for societal change. What is most remarkable is the amount of inteUigence, work and  courage these musicians have had to invest  in developing their musical careers.  HopefuUy, Kivi's overview is only the beginning. There is a chaUenge inherent to  academics in Canadian Women Making  Music—to take over where the book leaves  off and to fiU in the gaps. The author has  included a complete hst of notes and references that would make a good starting point  for further research.  For now, it's the kind of book many of  us could use a copy of in our personal libraries. In the words of the author: "What  is the importance of rediscovering women's  history? The more I thought about it, the  more I realized how much the past has to  do with the present; to look at one without  the other is to miss half the picture. To hear  about the struggles of our predecessors is to  understand to context of our own struggles.  "To know about these women is empowering; it reaffirms our own potential. To  share in what they created can be a source  of great inspiration. To hear, know and  share is to claim our past and, in the process, to reclaim our place in present day society."  Jennifer Catchpole is an East Vancouver-based writer, whose first published short story recently appeared in  Getting Wet: Tales of Lesbian Seductions  from Women's Press, Toronto.

(WUd East PubUshing, Fredericton 1992)  KINESIS < Arts  ////////////////////////^^^^^  Interview with Sheila Norgate:  Art show rocks boat  BAD GIRLS ROCK THE BOAT  An exhibition by SheUa Norgate  Bridge Street GaUery,  GranvUle Island, Vancouver, BC  October 30—November 8, 1992  by Penny MacPherson  SheUa Norgate has been working as a  professional artist since 1986. Her work has  been included in numerous shows in Victoria and Vancouver and she designed the logo  for the pan-Canadian conference on lesbian  and gay rights, OutRights/Les Droits Visible [see page 9]. A solo show of her work  opens at Vancouver's Bridge Street GaUery  later this month. I spoke with Norgate at  her home in Victoria a couple of months  ago.  Penny MacPherson: Sheila, you have  had an overwhelming response to your art  from many women. You see yourself as a  feminist artist. In your opinion, what characteristics of your work most appeal to  women?  Sheila Norgate: [My work] is very much  women-centred. My focus is my experience  and it's the experience of a woman. My  point of view is female in that sense. I'm  also a lesbian, so my focus is perhaps even  more women-centred. It stands out in a totally male-identified culture.  Penny: Can you teU me a Uttle about  the major themes in your art?  Sheila: My themes are whatever is happening in my hfe and the biggest theme,  I would say the grand theme, that under-  Unes almost everything I do is my struggle  to come to consciousness from a place of repression. It is a visual journal, a visual diary of my evolution towards self-realization.  BAD 61RIS=  MCEGIRIS  The art of Sheila Norgate  Penny: Becoming more autonomous?  Sheila: Yes, very definitely autonomous,  a fuUy formed adult person. Being self-  contained, not in an isolationist, avoidant  way but self-sufficient, supporting myself,  which then frees me to be much more intimate than I could ever have been before.  Penny: Do you think this theme has special significance for women?  Sheila: Yes, because now, more than ever  before, women are trying to come to a place  of autonomy, to reach our fuU size, our fuU  stature, in the culture, in our homes and in  our relationships, in ourselves. That's our  journey to come out and take up aU the  space that we are entitled to.  Penny: Your Nice Girls, Bad Girls series are attracting attention. How did they  develop?  Sheila: The Nice Girls series developed  first, because I was a nice girl long before  I was a girl. The Nice Girls came out in  the fall of 1990.1 was preparing for a show  and the Nice Girls took over so much of the  work that the show itself was titled Nice  Girls Don't Make Waves. But it had been  a very long process. When I look back over  the years, the whole issue of Nice Girls and  Bad Girls, the whole spUt, had come up in  other ways long before I identified the dichotomy of nice and bad girls.  Penny: What does nice girls mean to  you?  Sheila: It means a pathological insistence on setf-effacement and self-subjugation and aUowing someone to take up your  space. It means not speaking your mind, not  saying "no" if your mouth is fuU of it, not  being able to put yourself first in your Ufe,  not having any appetites. A lot of my work  is about appetites, a self-imposed minimal-  "The risk is in  telling it.  The gift is in  having people  receive it."  - Sheila Norgate  Penny: And Bad Girls?  Sheila: It's the flip side of the coin and I  must say I feel much happier exploring what  bad girls do or don't do. Certainly, the focus  now is on what bad girls are, or bad girls in  relation to nice girls. Of course I'm not talking about being bad, I'm talking about being whole. Bad is the judgement that society has about any woman who wants what  she wants when she wants it.  Penny: Dares to want?  Sheila: Yes. A 'good' girl doesn't even  know that she wants. A 'nice girl' doesn't  even know she has an appetite. She eats  Uke a bird, drinks of Ufe with a very duU,  blunted thirst. There's a vulnerabUity in  wanting something, and exposure.  Penny: Could you describe your first  paintings.  Sheila: The first works were true 'nice  girl' paintings. They were very lovely pastoral scenes. At first, I couldn't even rely  on any imagery coming from inside of me. I  had no idea there was anything inside me. A  'nice girl' doesn't even know she's there. So  I used external references aU the time. Photographs. The very first things I did were  taken virtuaUy off photographs. I needed a  road map, the guard rails. I had no idea  what imagery I might produce myself.  So, the first paintings were pale landscapes, very serene, very lovely. They  wouldn't ask much of anybody who was  looking at them ... and they weren't titled. HI put a title on a piece back then, it  was because I felt a particular connection to  what I was creating. One of the most striking things about the change in my work is  how titles are now so essential to me as part  of my expression. Before I had no voice. I  had no words to speak, no vocabulary of  Self.  Print-making is different. It is, by definition, very deliberate. I use an intermediary  medium, a block, which has to be carvec  out. And the words appear directly as part  of the overaU image which means that I have  to conceive of the image and the words before I even begin the process.  Penny: I've been speaking to people who  admire your work and they admire your  courage to express your feehngs publicly  and directly. They see you as risking exposure more than many visual artists. How  Sheila Norgate  Penny: Your titles are profound and certainly an integral part of your pictures. Can  you describe the process of titling?  Sheila: It's usuaUy a process of the title  coming after the visual. My paintings are  nearly always conceived of first, purely vi-  suaUy and it's very unconscious. I always  think of the paintings as the right brain process, very unformed, very intuitive. I'm just  there with a blank piece of paper. I have no  idea what I'm going to do. The title comes  when I have a more conscious relationship  with the piece. Sometimes it comes right  away but, other times, it takes me weeks to  know what it is that I need to say.  does it feel to have these very personal feelings exposed in this way?  Sheila: To put works up on the wal  and invite people to come and see them is  an amazing feehng. It's a risk but it's also  an incredibly empowering feeUng to teU my  story. That's what I'm doing here, telling  my story, and to have an audience to wit  ness the telling of the story is what the gif,  is for me. The risk is in telling it. The gif  is in having people receive it.  Penny: For those of us who see you work J  and some of our issues being acknowledged,  it is a two-way gift. Thank you, Sheila.
