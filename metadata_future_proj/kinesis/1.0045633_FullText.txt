Last month, Black increased his media concentration by buying out six more  BC newspapers for his Southam Chain [see  page 7.]  In response to his rivals, Black has retorted that they should "put up or shut up,"  meaning of course that if they don't like it,  they should join him and buy up a whole  bunch of newspapers themselves.  Meanwhile, Kinesis responded  with...see back cover.  It's really encouraging to witness that  amidst all the backlash against feminism,  women across the country are still continuing do some incredible and creative things  [seepage 8. ]  A wonderful example of solidarity is  how women came together around presenting testimonies to the Special Joint Committee on Custody and Access over the last  couple of months [see stories, this and last  issue.]  The Committee, with key-starring roles  by Liberal Senator Anne Cools—whose demands instigated the enactment of the  Committee—and her partner in mean-spirited crime, co-chair Liberal MP Roger Galloway, seems to have as its mission discrediting and re-victimizing women who speak  out about the realities women and children  face when going through divorce and separation.  Early on, once it became clear how  toxic the atmosphere at the Committee  hearings would be, women in Vancouver  (and indeed across the country) contacted  each other by phone and e-mail to share  stories, information, stats and strategies to  ensure we'd get our points across, with  minimal damage to our work, selves, credibility and integrity.  This show of strength and determination made it at least a bit safer for women  to speak before the Committee, and it is a  triumph we were able to get as many  women to speak, alongside the huge showing of disgruntled fathers and fathers'  rights groups.  Still, the antics of a few Committee  members made this consultations with the  public a less than "public" process. Many  women, particularly those who had experienced violence in their own intimate relationships and then been betrayed by the  justice system, did not testify their personal  stories before the Committee, because of the  hostility they would have faced. However,  women's and children's advocates are still  urging women to submit written stories  and recommendations concerning custody  and access issues to the Committee [see page  10 for submission info.]  As well, women at the receiving end  of disrespectful and inappropriate behaviour by Cools and other Committee members will be writing to various authorities  to ensure action against the offending Committee members, and that the Committee's  final report is read with its flawed process  in mind.

Speaking of politics in action....almost  500 people surrounded a hotel in downtown Montreal to challenge the MAI (the  multilateral agreement on investment).

The OECD or  the Organization of Economic Cooperation  and Development is the body where MAI  negotiations are taking place. Police eventually were called in to haul the protesters  away.  In response to the protest, the secretary-general Donald Johnston vowed that  ratification of the MAI would go ahead.  Johnston, a former Liberal MP, claimed that  those who challenge the MAI are just "misinformed" about the deal.  As feminists, it is imperative that we  continue challenging the larger political  agenda of corporate globalization behind  the MAI and other deals being negotiated,  such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) [see page opposite.]  The FTAA is more than an extension  of NAFTA in the region. Truth is, the FTAA  is not really about "trade;" it's more about  "investment." (Yes, investment, as in the  multilateral agreement on investment.)  For the 34 countries in the region, most  of their trade is directed towards the United  States. And there are relatively few trading  barriers between countries in the region, as  a number of bi- or multi-lateral trade agreements already exist.  So really, the FTAA's goal is about ensuring a smooth ride for multi-national  corporations—mostly from the US~who  want access to the natural resources and  labour pools, particularly in the countries  in the South.  That's all we have room for this month,  as Kinesis goes to press. We hope you enjoy  this edition oiKinesis, "news about women  that Conrad Black doesn't give a (hoot)  about." Have a great June.  This issue Kinesis would like to correct a couple of name-spelling errors in our May  1998 issue. Apologies to Michelle McGeough, who took our cover photo of the Garlic  Girls, and to Sharon Batt, a breast cancer survivor and activist in Montreal who was  listed as a resource in our story on tamoxifen [page 3.]  Summer is here and the sun is hot.  "Look out," the women are all taking off  their... Oops, that's for somewhere else inside this edition of Kinesis [see page 15.]  This month during most of production,  outside Kinesis, the weather was drab,  dreary and drizzly. But inside Kinesis, the  atmosphere was bright, bubbly and  bodacious. Lots of women dropped by  during production, and we all had hilarious times playing around with comic ideas,  especially for the back cover.  Speaking out that back cover... we want  to thank Colleen Sheridan for her "feminist scary tale," and for her life-like drawing of "the Creature." Thanks also to Becky  Bee and The Cob Builders Handbook for letting us use (and modify slighty) the drawing of the women encircling a cob house.  Over the past month, we have received  a lot of support in response to our difficul  financial situation. Certainly, things are  now picking up for Kinesis, and we would  like to thank all the women who got new  subscriptions to Kinesis, renewed their subs,  signed up friends, family, anyone and everyone, and responded to our "If 2,000 feminists donated $20 each..." campaign. Your  support is invaluable to the continued  growth of paper.  Aspecial thanks to the NationalAction  Committee on the Status of Women who  sent out a subscription support letter on  behalf oiKinesis to its membership. And we  thank Lee Lakeman and Penny Kome, who  both called on women via the Internet to  subscribe to Kinesis.  We also appreciate the women who  wrote letters and notes to us this month.  We received some very positive and fun  responses to our "Garlic" piece in last  month's issue.  Next year is Kinesis' 25th anniversary  year, and we want to make it big! We're not  sure what that means, and we're open to  ideas. Our newly struck Marketing Committee met last month to strategize around  all the exciting and practical ways to better  promote Kinesis. We hope to have a plan  worked out in the next few months on how  to build Kinesis' subscription, advertising  and distribution bases. We invite women  interested in joining this committee.  One thing we had hoped to do was  have a visioning meeting for Kinesis—looking at content, design, direction—in June,  but this may not happen because of scheduling difficulties. Still, we are committed  to having a visioning meeting, and invite  women to give us your comments or participate in the process. We'll keep you -  posted.  Kinesis is pleased and happy to welcome another member to the Editorial  Board: Laura Quilici. Laura recently started  getting more and more involved with Kinesis; but, for some time now, she has been  active with a number of feminist organizations about town—as a member of Vancouver Status of Women's Programming Committee and Battered Women's Support Services' Fundraising Committee. Welcome on  board Laura.  This issue we want to acknowledge  women who shared their thoughts, stories  and analysis with Kinesis for the first time.  Thanks to Evelyn Drescher, Louise,  Thauvette, Laura Quilici, Kate Hall, Gina  Gasongi Simon, Nancy Parker, Sheila  James, Melina Young and Melissa  Redmond.  Thanks also to Nicole Deagan for her  courage to tell her own personal story at  the Joint Senate/House Committee hearings on custody and access [see page 10.]  And thank you to all the women who spoke  to Kinesis about the exciting activities at  their women's organization: Debra  Apperly, Yvonne Sinkevich and Leah  White. We look forward to bringing our  reader more updates from women's groups  across the country and around the globe.  We also say 'hello' this issue to new  production volunteers Kathe Lemon,  Melissa Redmond, and Simone Jade.  Thanks all.  If you're interested in volunteering for  Kinesis, check out one of our next Story  Meetings on June 2 and August 4 at 7pm,  or come down during production for our  July/August issue between June 16 and 24.

JUNE 1998 News   Funding for women's organizations in Canada:  SWC refuses to change  by Agnes Huang  Despite widespread objections from  women's groups across the country, Status  of Women Canada (SWC) brought its new  funding guidelines into effect April 1st.  Since they were first announced a year  ago, women's groups have continually expressed their criticisms to Hedy Fry, the  secretary of state for SWC. Women made  clear the new funding arrangements, which  move away from program funding (a form  of "core" funding) towards strictly  "project" funding, will jeopardize the ongoing viability of many women's organization, [see Kinesis May 1997.]  Elaine Condon of the Gander Women's  Centre says that the seven women's centres in Newfoundland lost their program  funding, which was be used for, among  other things, rent, administration, and generally keeping the centre open.  "This year, we got some project funding, but we need the core funding because  that's what gives us the flexibility to work  on all the issues women bring to our doors,  and to spend time helping women sort  through their issues," says Condon.  "When you have to rely on project  funding, then your whole time is taken up  with the project, so you never get to do all  the stuff you're called upon to do by the  people in your community."  The Newfoundland government did  step in with a small grant for each women's centre. However, Condon says that  some groups which had previouly received program funding from SWC, such  as the provincial association against family violence, were not extended a provincial grant.  "It's not okay for SWC to the province  pick up the slack because the federal gov  ernment has the overall responsibility for  status of women in any case," says Condon.  "Responsibility" is the key word  stressed by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC). The  national umbrella group refused to apply  under the new guidelines in protest of  SWC's refusal to listen to women. As a consequence, NAC has been denied federal  funding, and is in danger of shutting down.  While other women's groups did file  their SWC funding applications under the  new criteria, they make it clear that it is not  because they support the changes, but out  of necessity. Most sya they support the action taken by NAC.  NAC's decision is part of a larger campaign to hold the federal government  accountabily to its stated commitment to  equality for women. Certainly, part of that  commitment would be to support the critical work provided by grassroots women's  organizations. However, since 1989, the federal Women's Program budget has been cut  by $5 million, and no new women's organization has received program funding since  1990 because of "budget constraints."  In a strategy to press for increased  funding for women's organizations, the  Women's Fair Share Campaign, a coalition  of national and Quebec women's groups,  launched its "toonie" postcard earlier this  year. "Aren't women worth more than a  cup of coffee?!" is the Campaign's slogan  in calling for an increase in the Women's  Program budget to $2 for each woman and  girl (equivalent to $30 million a year.)  The Campaign also compiled a list of  federal spending priorities, exposing how  much is spent on military in Canada, as  compared to on women [see box.]  In late April, the  members of the Women's Fair Share Campaign met with Hedy  Fry, and called on her  to support the campaign and rescind the  guidelines for funding.  As well, the groups  raised the issue of  funding for NAC, particularly the compromise suggested that  SWC provide NAC  with bridge funding  until an alternative  agreement can be  reached.  Fry refused to accept any of the proposals put forth.  Lise Martin, the  executive director of  the Canadian Research  Institute on the Advancement of Women  (a member group of  the Campaign), says  Fair Share Campaign  will be undertaking a  big push in the Fall,  and are calling on  women's groups  across the country to  lobby their local members of parliament  over the summer months.  Women are encouraged to support NAC  and the Women's Fair Share Campaign in the  fight to secure adequate and much-deserved  funding for women's organizations across  Canada.

The Free Trade Area of the Americas:  Stepping up the challenge  by Agnes Huang  About 2,000 people gathered in Santiago, Chile last April to challenge yet another extension of the global corporate  agenda, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).  The goal of the People's Summit of the  Americas was not to come up with a common statement in opposition to the FTAA.  Rather, says Patty Barrera, the goal was to  bring people together to work towards building a strong hemispheric social alliance to  confront free trade. Barrera is with Common  Frontiers, a multi-sectoral coalition in  Canada of national unions, human rights  organizations, and other NGOs whose focus  is on trade and social and economic integration issues in the Americas.  The FTAA is a trade liberalization  agreement under negotiation among the 34  countries of North, Central and South  America, excluding Cuba. The heads of  state of the FTAA nations first got together  to discuss such an agreement in 1994 in  Miami, Florida.  The driving force behind the Miami  Summit was the US government's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI),  which was part of the American's larger  agenda of global economic restructuring.  The EAI's goals were three-fold: hemispheric-wide free trade, promotion of investment, and the easing of debt burdens.  However, the US made it clear that for  countries to receive any funds for reducing their debt load, they must agree to IMF  [International Monetary Fund] or World  Bank structural adjustment programs.  The Miami Summit resulted in an action plan that set up two processes: the  FTAA, which was to deal strictly with trade  issues, and SIRG (the Summit Implementation Review Group), which was to deal  with everything else—human rights, education, health, environment, indigenous issues, democracy...  The FTAA process is in the hands of  the trade ministers of each member nation,  and the SIRG process is being handled  through the Organization of American  States by political appointees of the member countries.  Patty Barrera says having such a parallel structure is ridiculous and unrealistic  because trade issues cannot be separated  from the broader social and economic issues.  "You can't talk about poverty without  talking about income distribution," says  Barrera. "You can't talk about sustainable  development or education and literacy programs without talking about the reason  these programs don't exist in most Latin  American countries: their IMF debt loads.  Participants at the People's Summit  shared stories about how economic restructuring impacts on their communities,  linked their experiences in challenging the  global corporate agenda, and discussed  proposals for alternatives. A number of is-  see FTAA next page News  National Abortion Federation conference:  A world vision for choice  by Joyce Arthur  The National Abortion Federation  (NAF) held is 22nd annual meeting last  month in Vancouver. NAF is a North  American organization of abortion service  providers that works to keep abortion safe,  legal and accessible. This exciting conference was an opportunity for Vancouver's  abortion services community to network  with colleagues from all over Canada and  the United States.  The theme of the conference was "A World  Vision for Choice." The 700 participants—doctors, nurses, abortion clinic staff, and pro-choice  activists—celebrated the liberalization of abortion laws throughout the world, and especially  the 10-year anniversary of the Morgentaler decision in Canada and the 25th anniversary of  Roe v. Wade in trie US.  About 80 Canadians were able to attend, ensuring a strong Canadian voice at  this normally American-dominated conference. We took pride in talking about our  experiences here that were the envy of our  America friends, including having no anti-  abortion laws, the lack of controversy  around late-term abortions, and the social  stigma of being anti-choice.  The keynote speaker was Judy Rebick,  past president of Canada's National Action  Committee on the Status of Women and  host of the CBC program Face Off. A longtime pro-choice activist, Rebick is a former  spokesperson for the Canadian Abortion  Rights Action League (CARAL). Rebick  stressed the successes of the abortion rights  movement, pointing out, for example, that  no serious Canadian politician, including  Preston Manning, dares take a strong political stance against abortion. She also casually dismissed the paltry number of anti-  choice protestors trudging around outside  the hotel where the conference was being  held. Their advertised "96-hour vigil" was  a dismal failure, attracting only 40 to 50  protestors at peak times.  The conference featured 50 workshops,  sessions, training opportunities, and plenary speakers on an amazing variety of topics—from medical/scientific to legal/political. In addition, there were film screenings, awards, receptions, great food, and  plenty of time for networking.  The Canadian contingent organized  and held our own Canadian providers Day,  FTAA from previous page  sue forums were held covering: women's  issues, human rights, indigenous issues,  social and economic alternatives, environment, agrarian-campesinos, ethics, and  trade unions.  (The People's Summit coincided with  the second Leaders Summit of the FTAA  member nations, also held in Santiago.)  Fay Blaney,  who attended  the People's  Summit on behalf of the National Action  Committee on  the Status of  Women, participated in the  Women's Forum and the In-  digenous Forum. What  amazed her  most, she said,  was the scope  of the continental networking among the  indigenous groups, particularly via the Internet.  She also noted that the indigenous  women made a presentation separate from  the Women's Forum statement because they  wanted a stronger position taken on the issue of land. Blaney said that impetus came  from the indigenous women from Bolivia, a  country where women cannot own property  The land issue is also one that greatly  affects Aboriginal women in Canada,  Blaney added. As an example, she pointed  to the recent court case launched by the BC  Native Women's Society challenging provisions in the Indian Act which deny  women living on reserves access to matrimonial properties upon the breakdown of  their marriages, [see Kinesis April 1997.]  featuring topics like the mainstreaming of  abortion services, controlling media messages about abortion in Canada, and an  update on the task force investigating the  shootings of three Canadian doctors who  provide abortion services. Planned Parenthood and Medical Students for Choice also  held separate meetings on the same day.  Dr. Henry Morgentaler was presented  a special award for his many years of heroic struggle, culminating in the Supreme  Court decision in 1988 which threw out  Canada's abortion law. Several other Canadians were also honoured, including  Morris Manning, Morgentaler's lawyer in  the Supreme Court case; and Carolyn Egan,  a long-time abortion rights activist and a  spokesperson for the Ontario Coalition for  Abortion Clinics. Egan's inspiring and passionate acceptance speech resulted in a  standing ovation.  Joyce Arthur is with the Pro-Choice Action  Network (formerly the BC Coalition for Abortion Clinics.)  "...no serious  Canadian politician,  including  Preston Manning,  dares take a strong  political stance  against abortion."  — Judy Rebick —  It is a particularly important time for  Canadian women's groups to get involved  in mobilizing against the FTAA, as Canada  has taken a lead role in promoting of the  Miami Summit agenda. At the Santiago  Leaders' Summit, Canada agreed to chair  the FTAA for 18 months. And Canada will  be hosting the next meeting of trade minis-  _ ters and of  IN 1 theOASrep-  ViNlTi resentatives,  THERE.   \ as well as the  third Leaders' Summit,  which will  likely happen  four years  from now.  Barrera  mentions the  grassroots  opposition to  the MAI (the  multilateral  agreement on  investments), as inspiration for popularizing the movement against the FTAA. [Ratification of the MAI process was delayed for six  months following widespread protests in many  of countries.]  "The work we do in Canada can't just  be about going from Summit to Summit,"  says Barrera. "It's the work we do in-between that is critical."

For the first time, housework, child  and elder care—work done predominantly  by women—became concrete and visible. No  longer hidden in the household, or in the  micro-data of the general social surveys also  conducted by StatsCan, this achievement has  ensured that unpaid work is now concretely  on the public agenda.  Now, the issue is no longer just the recognition of unpaid work through measurements, it is how the information will be used  for women's equality. There is no guarantee  that unpaid work will figure automatically  into government decision-making. Individual women and women's organizations  need to be involved directly in the analysis,  development, implementation and monitoring of policies which affect the paid and unpaid work women do in our society.  The When Women Count Symposium  held in Ottawa last October was intended  to initiate a wider public discussion about  unpaid work issues among women in  Canada. It was conceived as a forum for  women's organizations to discuss, analyze  and develop strategies concerning unpaid  work and public policy, within a progressive, equality seeking, social and economic  justice framework.  It was also an opportunity to encourage national and grassroots women's  groups to integrate an analysis and understanding of unpaid work as an equality issue into our own advocacy work.  The participants brought with them a  wide range of experiences, ideas and concerns about unpaid work. One of the key  concerns was how the unpaid work of  women in the South drives the economies of  the North, and that most foreign aid packages are given on the basis of paid work.  As women worked together in the table discussions and workshops, they identified common values and priorities, and  formulated plans on how to increase awareness and recognition of unpaid work.

Public education  Symposium participants agreed on the  importance of bringing about an increased  awareness of the issues surrounding unpaid work. A shift in the attitudes of Canadians towards unpaid work is crucial to  ensuring that unpaid work is valued.  As Fely \felasin, representing the National  Action Committee on the Status of Women, said:  "If each of our organizations undertakes, within  this and next year, to educate ourselves on unpaid work and women's work in general, and  on economic literacy, that would be a very im-  portantfirststep."  do it for, under what conditions, how much  of it is paid, how much of it is unpaid, how  much of it is political organizing, how much  of it is caregiving, and so on. We could document this information and use it to support  our recommendations concerning social policies and resources allocation.  Working together  Throughout the symposium, participants expressed the view that the proposed  strategies and actions would be more successful if we work together. A number of  women suggested that the diverse groups  ...when women in Sierra  Leone are compared to  women in Britain  [using the EGEI,]  the former have a better  standard of living.  One strategy suggested for changing the  public's perception of "work" was to use language that speaks to our realities—language  that talks about paid work and unpaid work,  rather than working and non-working.  Participants also recommended more  overt public education at the organizational  (rather than the individual) level, such as  holding workshops; using the tactics of  guerilla theatre; distributing pamphlets and  posters; and engaging the media wherever  possible and encouraging them to use inclusive language. One thing made clear at  the symposium was that it is important to  take public education about unpaid work  into the arena of the paid workforce.  Another, and most likely very effective,  strategy would be for women to organize a  nation-wide strike of unpaid workers. Look  at what the women of Iceland were able to  achieve when they had a general strike. Imagine the disruption we could cause!  The Census  Participants at the symposium applauded the lobbying done around inclusion  of unpaid work into the 1996 Census for  bringing national attention to the issue. However, while some saw the important potential policy applications of the Census data  (and other data that might result from further questions on volunteer work), there were  differing opinions about the value of directing the already scarce resources of grassroots  women's organizations in this direction.  Delegates also identified an inherent  weakness in the Census: it is based on the  GDP [Gross Domestic Product,] which is a  economic system that includes the assumption that unpaid work has no value. Newer  methods of measuring all work, such as the  GPI (the Genuine Progress Indicator) which  does recognize unpaid work, were advocated by all participants.  One strategy discussed concerning the  use of the 1996 Census data was going across  the country talking to other women about  what is all the work we actually do, who we  represented at the symposium could join  in solidarity around the belief that people  should not have to live in poverty.  As long as the majority of women's  work is unpaid, then not only will the majority of single mothers, single elderly  women and increasing numbers of children  live below the poverty line, but also the  general status of all women will continue  to be low. At present, corporate global restructuring is driving more and more  women into unpaid work taking care of  children, elderly and sick people, and into  volunteer work in the community.  The only response is to demand a recognition of unpaid work and an end to the  growth of that kind of work. Women's work  must be valued. From that start-off point,  organizations could pursue their differing,  but complimentary, activities.  The great leap forward  On March 17,1998, the 1996 Census results regarding "Household Activities" were  released. That was followed by another leap  forward by the Canadian government in recognizing unpaid work, with the release by  the Federal-Provincial/Territorial Ministers  Responsible for the Status of Women of the  document Economic Gender Equality Indicators (EGEI). This document moves Canada  to the forefront internationally, in requiring  that all federal departments' policies be put  through a gender lens that includes both paid  and unpaid work.  The EGEI is a measurement system  which can be used to provide a more accurate picture of women's economic status  across Canada. Hopefully, they will be used  by women's groups, unions, educators, and  all levels of government to paint a clearer  picture of what women's lives are really like.  This past March, Statistics Canada, Status of Women Canada and Human Resources Development Canada hosted an international symposium called "Gender  Equality Indicators: Public Concerns and  Public Policies," which brought together spe  cialists from all over the world, various levels of government, academics, researchers,  and NGOs to discuss the connection between  economic gender equality indicators and  gender-based analysis. Mothers Are Women,  a national organization of mothers, was invited to facilitate the participation of 15 individuals and organizations actively involved in the issue of unpaid work.  Discussions at the symposium ranged  from how these indicators must be broadly  applied to all women in Canada wherever  they are, rather than to just a select sample  who are, for example, living in cities, or in  middle-class, heterosexual, white families.  If applied properly, these indicators  could show how not recognizing the unpaid work of Aboriginal women is contributing directly to their poverty and the  apprehension of their children. They could  be used to ensure that older women are  paid a public pension that would raise, not  only their sense of worth, but also their  incomes above the poverty line.  They could be used to challenge the  income tax schedule which falls so heavily on poor, and low and middle income  people. They could completely overthrow  the GDP as a model of economic development.  They could be used by municipal governments to determine the services needed  by women. They could be used by unions to  recognize all women's work, and ensure  childcare is available for meetings and a paid  work schedule that allows for unpaid work.  They could be used to call for a monetary valuing of women's unpaid work;  and they should be applied to all international trade agreements like APEC, MAI,  FTAA to show how they directly increase  the exploitation of women internationally.  A speaker from the United Nations  said at the symposium that using the EGEI  shows that women in China are, in fact,  better off than women in Japan, who have  a higher per capita income. And when  women in Sierra Leone are compared to  women in Britain, the former have a better  standard of living. Why is this? Because,  the EGEI looks at all facets of women's  lives, not just the paid ones.  Women in Canada have led the movement to have unpaid work counted and  recognized. We should be proud.

In her annual report released in April,  the Chief Commissioner of the Canadian  Human Rights Commission, Michelle  Falardeau-Ramsay, chastised the federal  government for failing to live up to its obligation to protect the economic rights of  poor people, and to prohibit discrimination  based on poverty. Falardeau-Ramsay's annual report also recognized the years of  awareness-raising work that anti-poverty  organizations have done.  Falardeau-Ramsay pointed out that, as  a signatory of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Canada  has endorsed the right of individuals to an  adequate standard of living, and is under  obligation to provide adequate "food,  clothing, housing and medical care, and  necessary social services to its citizens." The  chief commissioner added that "It is now  time to recognize poverty as a human rights  issue here at home," and called on the Canadian government to do more to end poverty than just look good at international  conferences.  If Canada is going to walk its talk, anti-  poverty activists say that one of the first  things the federal and provincial governments must do is restore funding to welfare programs, which have been cut over  the last few years.  In British Columbia, anti-poverty activists are pressing the provincial government to support a recommendation by the  BC Human Rights Commission, which  would prohibit discrimination on the basis of "social condition."  Abortion illegal in  Wisconsin  Women in Wisconsin have lost their legal right to access abortion services after a  Court of Appeal refused to grant a temporary injunction on a state law which essentially bans all abortion procedures.  The law was signed by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson on April 29. Promoted as a "partial birth abortion" ban,  which focuses on the late stages of pregnancy, the Wisconsin law is actually  worded so generally that it can be seen to  apply to any and all abortions. The law  bans the "killing of a child," and defines a  child as "a human being from the time of  fertilization."  On May 14, US District Court Judge  John Shabaz refused to impose a temporary  injunction on the state law. His verdict was  upheld by the US Court of Appeal for the  7th Circuit a week later.  As a result of the courts' refusal to  strike down the law, women in Wisconsin  seeking even first trimester abortions are  being turned away. (The legal right to a first  trimester abortion was guaranteed by the  Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade.) With a few  exceptions in places, where local prosecutors have guaranteed they will not prosecute abortion service providers for "early"  abortions, all abortion clinics in Wisconsin  have ceased providing services.  "This is the first time since the Supreme  Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973 that  women have been denied medical care [for  abortions]," says Priscilla Wade, a lawyer  with the Center for Reproductive Law and  Policy. "This should be a wake up call for  the country to realize that these laws are not  limited to Tate term' or any specific abortion  procedure. They are part of a carefully designed strategy to outlaw all abortions."  Although 27 other states have also  passed abortion bans in the past three years,  Wisconsin is the only state in which the courts  have not subsequently limited enforcement  of the ban or blocked it completely.  Conrad Black increases his control  Six more newspapers in Canada have  fallen into the right-wing hands of Conrad  Black Black, whose Hollinger Inc. owns 59 percent of the Southam newspaper chain, announced last month his plans to purchase two  daily newspapers in BC, and several other community newspapers on Vancouver Island.

With the acquisition of the Victoria Times  Colonist and the Nanaimo Daily News,  Southam Inc. will now own 14 of BC's 16  daily newspapers. The recently announced  deal means that the two dailies will shift  from one media mogul to another. The previous owner of the two papers was the  Thomson Corporation, headed by billionaire  Kenneth Thomson, who was once the dominant publisher of small-town Canadian dailies. Now, the only dailies in BC still being  published by Thomson are in Penticton and  Kelowna. (Though Thomson still owns the  Globe and Mail.)  Southam Inc. currently controls 32 daily  newspapers across Canada, including the  Vancouver Sun and The Province. The new additions to Southam's roster mean control over  the circulation of newspapers in Vancouver,  Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria, Nanaimo,  Campbell River, Duncan, Parksville and  Cowichan.  This concentration of newspaper ownership definitely holds potential dangers for  ensuring "balance" in reporting, particularly  given that Southam papers pool their stories  through the Southam News Service. Even  Peter Bailie, the current publisher of the Victoria Times Colonist, says that while he is not  aware of any changes that the paper's new  owners might have in mind, he does expect  that Lower Mainland issues written by Vancouver Sun journalists will see further coverage in Vancouver Island newspapers.

The Indonesian Supreme Court  has ordered PT Eltri Indo Footwear to reinstate the workers and pay their lost wages.  This ruling supports a decision made  by Indonesia's highest labour court five  years ago. While the ruling is a step in the  right direction, many people are skeptical  that it will actually be enforced.  Sukaesih is familiar to many Canadian activists because of her cross-Canada  solidarity tour in 1997, but there are also  many others who continue to struggle for  justice.

This year's institute takes place  in Vancouver from July 26 to 29 at the Britannia  Community Services Centre.  CDI presents workshops and forums  for people from all sectors to come together  to update their knowledge on current community issues, obtain skills for taking action, and to build solidarity within their  communities and beyond.  Workshops this year fall under six  streams: Social Justice; Community Economic Development; Environmental Stewardship; Strengthening Our Voice: Tools for  Practice; Working Together; and Governing  Ourselves.  This year's program will also feature  two forums for participants in the Institute:  "Towards a Just and Sustainable Society:  Reflections on a Decade of Activism" on  Sunday July 26, and "The Death and Life  of Great Vancouver Neighbourhoods: A  Citizen's Forum with June Jacobs."

Billy, who lives in Squamish, British  Columbia, was one of the founders of the  Howe Sound Women's Centre, and between 1989 and 1995, was the editor of  Herspectives Magazine, a feminist quarterly.  Billy is also the author of "Facing the  Horror: The Femicide List," a compilation  of names and short synopses of the incidents of women and girls murdered by men  in Canada since 1990. She begins the list  with the 14 women murdered on Decem  ber 6, 1989 at the Ecole Polytechnique in  Montreal.  She has applied for Ministry of Women's Equality funding to be able to put more  time and effort into researching the list,  which she feels is only half complete.  The Helen Prize is named after anti-nuclear activist Helen Caldicott. The prize was  started this year by Iranian poet short story  writer Dr. Akhtar Naraghi, who now lives  in Montreal. Naraghi says she was inspired  by the story of Dr. Helen Caldicott as portrayed in the film If You Love This Planet.  The prize is awarded to women who  have made significant, and often unrecognized, contributions to the quality of life  around the world. This year, 20 women  were nominated. Their work will be recognized by having their stories published in  the 1998 Helen Prize Book.  A think-tank of our  own  Finally, there's a think-tank on "the  family" that's not right-wing. Responding  to widespread misconceptions and "family values" nonsense, the Council on Contemporary Families—composed of family  researchers, theorists and practitioners—  was formed last Fall. The Council held its  inaugural conference, "Reframing the Politics of Family Values," in Washington D.C  in November.  The impetus for the group came out of  a growing belief among US scholars that  several influential, right-wing family think-  tanks have politicized and oversimplified  the American discussion about families.  The Council wants to look realistically  and accurately at the current state of the  family, and counter the view that a return  to the "traditional" family is the solution  to the social ills in America.

The conference will take place  July 3 to 5 in Los Angeles, California on the  UCLA campus.  Of special interest to APLB feminists  is the all-day "Activist Institute" on Friday,  July 3. As well, workshops will be held on  a variety of topics, including: HIV/AIDS  Awareness and Education, Women's Health  Issues, International Organizing, Domestic  Violence, Alternative Parenting, and APLB  Adoptees.  The conference will also feature a "Cultural Extravaganza" performance night with  Canyon Sam, the Purple Moon Dance  Project, and Denise Uyehara, among others.  The APLBN is a coalition of individuals and groups, mostly based in the US, that  serves as a network to empower and support Asian and Pacific Islander lesbian and  bisexual women. The goals of the coalition  are: to create visibility, build leadership,  develop resources, and strengthen ties  among APLB women; to build alliances  with other organizations; and to reflect the  diversity within the Asian and Pacific Islander communities through outreach and  education.  "[Postering] creates a real litter problem and ifs unsightly."  - Vancouver City Engineer Dave Rudberg -  ...and that's why the City of Vancouver is removing posters from "public"  property—such as telephone poles and light standards—despite a court ruling  that defends postering as a form of free expression. The City's no postering bylaw severely hinders the sharing of information of all the groups and individuals who do not have money for mainstream advertising. And it shuts off information on issues the mainstream media don't want to cover (like forcing welfare recipients to sign consent forms.) The City plans to appeal the court ruling  striking down its by-law on June 18.  For more information about the campaign against the by-law, call 874-0790 or  e-mail alissaw@unixg.ubc.ca.

The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities (IHRAAM),  an affiliate of the UN with consultative status, is conducting the inquiry into allegations of murder and other atrocities at residential schools.  A panel of international human rights  experts will receive testimony and examine evidence. The panel will assess the guilt  or innocence of church, government and  police officials in reported deaths and torture of Aboriginal children at the residential schools. Then, the panel will forward  its findings to the Secretary-General of the  UN, the Human Rights Commission, and  to the international media.  Anyone having personal, family or any  kind of knowledge of the abuse, torture and  murder of First Nations people at residential schools and the intergenerational legacy  of the residential school system, is urged  to attend this tribunal so the full truth about  the schools can be made known and the  healing can begin. Testimonies can be made  either in full confidence at the public tribunal or in private.  The Tribunal will be held at the Maritime Labour Centre, 1880 Triumph St, beginning at 9:00am each day.

Women's Conference Against APEC  Planning is well under way for the 3rd  Women's Conference Against APEC (Asia-  Pacific Economic Cooperation), to be held  November 9-10 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  Planning meetings are being held periodically in different parts of Asia. The next planning meeting will be held in Aranakoman,  Tamilnadu, India on June 3-4,1998.  Organizers have agreed to continue the  position taken at the 2nd Women's Conference in Vancouver last year of rejecting  APEC And once again, women will be  working to ensure a strong position on gender justice and rights will be made a part  of the People's Summit on APEC (November 10-15).  The Women's Conference is urgently  needed to address the increasing impact of  globalization and liberalization on women's lives, including the erosion of existing,  hard fought rights and regulations protecting women.  Some of the topics being suggested for  discussion at the conference include: health  and reproductive rights; labour issues, including retrenchment and migration; food  security and safety; and speaking out  against globalization past and future.  As well, one potential outcome of the  conference may be the production of a  "Feminist Vision of Development and  Trade" document.  In support of the 3rd Women's Conference Against APEC, the Vancouver organizing Committee of the 2nd Women's  Conference contributed $8,000Cdn towards  the organizing efforts.

Let's keep each other posted on  Legal rights for farm  women  by Yvonne Sinkevich, women's  president, National Farmers' Union  One of our current projects involves  working in a coalition on the legal rights of  farm women. The other coalition groups  are the Canadian Farm Women's Network,  the Federated Women's Institute, and two  organizations in Quebec, ACPA (Association de collaboratrices et partenaires en  affaires), an organization of farm women  and business women, and the FAQ  (Federation des agricultrices du Quebec),  the women's arm of UPA, the general farmers' organization in Quebec.  For the first phase, we did a round of  workshops and focused on whether or not  farm women knew what their legal rights  were, and how that impacted their farms,  incomes, estate planning and divorce. I did  a local workshop here regarding succession  planning and separating income after divorce. Farm business is really quite complicated and when there's a split up in the  marriage, it does not necessarily go in favour of women (the ones who've done a  large extent of the work on the farm.)  We discussed that we had to do some  major educational campaigns with banking and other farm related institutions. We  need to increase their understanding that  women are farm operators who need access to cash and crop insurance and things  of that matter. We're starting to work with  NAWL (the National Association of Women  and the Law) on some really upfront ad  campaigns, and we'll meet with lawyers,  accountants, and people with whom farm  women deal on a regular basis, to sensitize  them about women's rights.  Over the years, there have been some  legal precedents that have helped women,  but they're not consistent across the provinces. Not only are the laws different, but  so is knowledge of these laws among farm  women. We want [the project] to be educational for farm women on their rights to  land and cash, and to debt, I suppose  [laughs]—that's part of farming too.  Ownership of farm land is a critical  issue because, at one time, it was mainly  the husbands who held sole ownership  over the farm. Many women did not have  any rights. [When their husbands died  without willing the land to their wives,] it  was a big problem for the women. All of a  bank accounts were frozen. Usually there's  a major debt, and they have absolutely no  rights to cash, and no means to pay the debt.

Also,  many women work for other companies—  as surveyors or geologists—and are subcontracted to the mining camps.  Surveying sexual  harassment  by Leah White, coordinator, Victoria  Faulkner Women's Centre,  Whitehorse,Yukon   Our project of surveying sexual harassment in mining camps started two years ago.  We actually started with the assumption that only a few women worked in mining camps, but that assumption proved to  be wrong. There are more women than in  the past, and probably there'll be more in  the future. It is becoming more of a work  environment that financially entices  women. As a result, the project snowballed.  A lot of women come up here thinking  they want to do something different, and  become cooks in the camps. Other women  are geologists and surveyors, and this is  where they end up getting jobs.  A lot of the mining companies don't  have sexual harassment policies. The unionized mining camps do, but most women  So far, I've interviewed about 12  women, and I have another 10 to interview.  However, what has been happening is that  women being interviewed are saying they  have five friends who want to talk to me,  so there may still be more women interested  in participating in the project.  Part of the interview process involves  providing women with information about  sexual harassment, because we found out  that some women weren't aware of what  behaviour was legally unacceptable. The  big thing for a lot of women is not trusting  how they felt. A lot of the women said they  didn't know if the company they work for  has a sexual harassment policy.  In terms of experiences, women reported from one extreme to the other. Some  women said they've worked in camps for  years, and their experiences have been  amazing. Other women talked about inappropriate comments and touching, and  about pornography in the camps. And others said they've been told they cannot have  any type of relationship in the camp or else  they'll be fired; the men aren't told that.  The one common statement made by  women interviewed is that the harassment  isn't coming from entire camps; it's only a  few individual men. Women said they  didn't want to give the impression that  mining camps are places where sexual harassment and assault happen all the time.  I've contacted a number of mining companies who operate in the Yukon, and have  heard back from five of them. Their response  has been quite positive. The companies say  they're interested in our findings, and want  to know if there are any sexual harassment  policies they could incorporate. I'm in the  process of gathering up sexual harassment  policies that would be appropriate to mining camps.  None of the mining companies I talked  to said women shouldn't be working in the  camps. In fact, a lot of them say the women  who've come through their camps have  been amazing, and that they'd support any  way to ensure they get more women working for them.  We're not trying to say that Mines A, B  and C are the bad ones, and D, E and F are  the good ones. Most women I've talked to  say they don't want us choosing for them  where to work. They just want to know who  has a sexual harassment policy, so they can  make decisions themselves.  The Victoria Faulkner Women's Centre  would appreciate receiving copies of sexual  harassment policies that could be appropriate  to mining camps.

New resource guide  for HIV+ women  by Janet Madsen, communications  coordinator, Positive Women's Net-  work, Vancouver, British Columbia  We made an application to Health  Canada to do a resource guide for women  with basic information about HIV/AIDS.  We wanted to do something really simple,  that didn't require a high level understanding of medical terminology.  What we had heard, time and time  again from women was that some of the  information they get is way too complicated. When women are first diagnosed,  they're not at a place where they have an  understanding of what everything means,  such as CD4 counts and viral loads and the  different treatment options. Feature  ■5 S;  5 £  Health Canada did a literature search  and found there wasn't anything of this  kind in Canada, and said "go for it."  We developed a folder that's small, so  women can carry it with them. We also  wanted it to be something that wasn't identified as "HIV" or "AIDS" on the cover, so  women wouldn't be too intimidated to pick  one up. It's got 14 inserts and each of them  talks about a different aspect of HIV Each  sheet has three to four questions and answers, and then there's a resource sheet at  the back which is regionalized for different  areas in the province, such as Vancouver,  Northern BC, the Caribou, the Okanagan,  et cetera.  We held a focus group with some of the  women from Positive Women's Network,  based on the rough draft. Most women said  they wished this kind of thing had been  around when they were first diagnosed.  They liked that it was straightforward, easy  to understand and non-threatening.  When women are first diagnosed, they  not only have to deal with an overwhelming sense of the change in their lives, they  also have to deal with the pressure of suddenly having to be an expert on living with  HTV, and on HTV itself. And as a woman discloses to family and to friends, people start  asking questions. Women don't always have  those answers, because it's just as new to  them as it is to the people they're telling.  One of the women in the focus group  pointed out that if you're living in a small  community and your doctor is being a jerk,  you don't necessarily have another choice.  Hopefully, this pocket guide can provide  some information to let women know they  have a right to ask questions and that it's  absolutely within their ability to do so. One  of the other things we hope is that the resource sheets will give women a sense that  they are not alone, and that there are ways  of getting through even though they may  be living in an isolated area.  The pocket guide can also be used as  an education tool in a broader way. We see  the pocket guide going to women living  with HTV, their families and care providers, and to people who want general information about women and HIV  Right now, we're distributing them  across the province to service organizations, transition houses, shelters, women's  organizations, and other organizations such  as health units and needle exchanges that  don't necessarily have HTV/AIDS as their  mandate but do see people living with HTV.  We've just been granted funding to do  a national distribution, which will happen  within the next year. We'll be working in  partnership with agencies across the country to regionalize the resource sheets for different areas.  The Positive Women's Network welcomes  requests for copies of their Pocket Guide for  Women Living with HTV/AIDS.

Legal aid a big  problem  by Elaine Condon, coordinator,  GanderWomen's Centre,  Gander, Newfoundland   There's a big problem in this province  concerning women getting access to legal aid  resources. Our system reeks of discrimination because the way the legal aid mandate  is set up results in women receiving only five  percent of the funding from legal aid and  men receiving 95 percent. The emphasis in  the mandate is criminal law, and because  men make up the vast majority of [those  charged under aiminal law,] they get the vast  majority of legal aid resources.  We're trying to get the [provincial] department of justice to change the mandate  so that women have equal access to legal  aid. Right now, we're documenting cases  that were handled poorly because women  couldn't access legal representation.  Legal aid will not represent women for  custody issues, unless the man has first engaged a private lawyer. Then, legal aid will  give the woman a lawyer only because they  want the situation to be equal. If a woman  is the one who wants to initiate a custody  battle, she'll either have to hire a private  lawyer or represent herself, which can  cause all kinds of problems.  The problem with the legal aid system in  Newfoundland has always been present, but  until the transition house was opened up in  Gander five years ago, we didn't have as much  contact with women to know how bad it was.  Now, because we're working closely with all  the women using transition houses in the province, we're finding out that this is a very widespread problem  When women leave abusive situations and  go to a transition house, they need to get cus  tody of their children; otherwise, they can be  ordered to bring the kids back to their husbands.  If they have any property, legal aid will  not even represent them in getting an interim custody order. This leaves women in  a situation where they're afraid the husband will drive by and take the kids.  There's also the problem of not being  able to get legal aid for property settlement  cases. What invariably happens is that a  woman has to hire a private lawyer who  agrees to be paid when the property dispute is settled. In the end, the lawyer winds  up getting her share of the family property.  A criminal is not forced to sell his house to  get representation in court. Legal aid  should represent women in property issues,  so at least when they get out of an abusive  situation, they have some minimal amount  with which to start over.

Gathering of warrior  women  by Debra Apperly, Kamloops Sexual  Assault Counselling Centre,  Kamloops, British Columbia   One of the goals of our agency is to build  a feminist community in Kamloops, so we  started holding regular monthly meetings  called Warrior Women Nights. There's already been a lot of excitement about our  Warrior Women Nights, because one thing  I've found is that there are many younger  women who want to know about feminism.  It speaks to them, but of course in  school, they're not getting the training and  information they actually want. Younger  women are so bombarded by the backlash  that it's often hard for them to sort through  what is true about feminists and what the  media has made us out to be.  We're holding a three day workshop  June 13-15 called "Self in Context: Theory  and Practice with Trauma Survivors." The  workshop will be facilitated by Sandra  Butler, who is the author of two books, Conspiracy of Silence and Cancer in Two Voices,  and is an internationally known feminist  therapist, lecturer and training facilitator.  There's also going to be a public presentation on June 12, called "Feminism: the Politics of Hope."  I was actually the instigator of this workshop, and it came out of having done sexual  assault work for 15 years. One of the things I  noticed missing from doing the work was a  strong social action base, where women truly  understood what feminism means and how  to embed feminist philosophy into their practice and counselling.  What I'm hoping will happen is that  women will take ownership of Warrior  Women Nights, and it'll be like when we  used to do consciousness raising back in  the late 70s and early 80s. We'll begin with  looking at feminist literature, feminist counselling techniques, feminists books, so we  can start a dialogue among ourselves about  what feminism means to us, to our daughters and friends, and to our clients.

"Don't agonize,  organize"  by Ema Oropeza, program coordina-  tor, Vancouver Status of Women  One of our current projects is an eight-  week program for women interested in  feminist popular education, called "Gaining My Voice, Taking Our Strength." This  program is based on using feminist analysis to understand our realities as women.  Although there are topic areas listed  for each of the weekly sessions, nothing is  set in stone. The program is flexible enough  to address the specific concerns of the  women participating in it.  In the first session, we negotiate the  content of the program to see if there's  something women want added. We also  establish some group agreements in order  to be able to work together.  Over the course of the program, we  cover issues related to health; economic globalization and poverty; violence against  women, heterosexism and homophobia;  racism and anti-racism. And then in the final session, we look at the issues the women  have in common, and decide on a collective project. We call this session: "Don't  agonize, organize."  An important part of "Gaining My  Voice" is for women to keep acknowledging and reminding ourselves that the solutions for our lives don't come from so-  called experts. Rather, the solutions are inside each woman who lives the struggle  day-to-day.  One of the goals of the program is to  provide women with a system or methodology for converting that understanding of  their lives into a direction for change. As  well, through "Gaining My Voice," we hope  to bring more women into the women's  movement, and to make the women's  movement more and more grassroots.  There are three stages of the program:  unfolding our experiences; naming those  experiences for what they are and identifying them as part of a common struggle  within a patriarchal and capitalist system;  and planning actions that address our  needs so that we become our own agents  of change.  We started the first "Gaining My Voice"  program in February. We hadn't conceived  of it as a program for Aboriginal women  only, but a group of Aboriginal women,  who already had a connection with VSW,  requested such a program. One thing that  came out of the sessions was that the  women organized a night of films about  Aboriginal women and a panel discussion.  A number of women from the program  said they really connected with the way  popular education looks at problems—that  is, problems are not linear (with a cause and  a consequence), but rather multi-dimensional. And one woman said that when she  thinks about strategizing around an issue,  she looks at the problem and the solutions  from many different angles. Before, she  didn't make all the connections—she would  go from A to B. Now, she says, she looks at  how A relates to B, to C, to D and to E.

Feature  Joint Committee on custody and access issues:  Using children as weapons  by Nicole Deagan   The Special joint Senate/House of Commons Committee on Custody and Access Issues continued its cross-Canada hearings last  month. On May 19, the Committee returned  to Vancouver to complete the second day of the  two-day hearings that had been scheduled. [The  original second day was postponed because  members of parliament on the Committee had  to return to the House of Commons for a vote  on the Hepatitis C issue.]  Nicole Deagan, a child care counsellor  working in Vancouver, was one of the advocates for women and children who addressed  the Committee when it came back to Vancouver. Below, Kinesis presents her submission.  But first, Deagan explains why she spoke about  her own experience at the Committee hearings.  One purpose in presenting this part of  my personal history to the Special Joint  Committee was to show, through the telling of intimate experience, how batterers  use the courts and how this affects children.  There is a possibility that certain committee members will attempt to use it as a  confirmation of "Parental Alienation Syndrome" (PAS), which is touted by Fathers'  Rights groups as one of the ways that  women damage their children. This is very  unfortunate, as my history is one of male  violence against women and children, not  one that validates this fantasy of vindictive  women. Hopefully, my response to the  Committee's questions about PAS at the  hearings let them know that I do not hold  my story as support for this unfounded,  questionable and misused theory.  Without wanting to pass judgement on  what this Committee will conclude before  they have done so, their apparent disbelief  in women's reality was a bit too similar to  my experience with the legal system as a  child, and I fear that the bias of certain  members will taint their recommendations,  as it tainted their hearing process.  Here is what I presented to the  Committee:  I was seven years old, and one day my  father picked me and my brothers up from  school. As we drove away from the town  we lived in, my father told us that we would  never see our mother again. We went to  someone's house where my father called my  mom and told her that if she didn't get out  of the house by the next morning he would  leave the country with us.  I didn't understand what was going  on. My brothers and I were very close to  our mom. She had stayed home and looked  after us. Our father worked as a teacher at  a local high school.  The next day, we went back home and  my father called a lawyer and said that his  wife had left him and us three kids for another man. This is also what he told us. Of  course, at first I knew that it had happened  differently, but through repeated sessions  of telling us stories about our mother, we  all began to believe him.  He used to take me into his bedroom.  There was a big chair at one wall and I  would sit on it while he told me things. He  would tell me that he would kill himself if  I ever left him, that he was so lonely now  that my mother had abandoned him, and  My recommendations to the Committee  I have listened to a number of witnesses during the two days of  hearings in Vancouver and have noticed that the reality of custody  and access disputes for children is well represented in the  presentations by women's groups, transition house workers, and  ChildrenWhoWitness Abuse program counsellors.  I recommend that you have ongoing consultations with the  experts in battering relationships, who have knowledge of how this  battering is continued through the courts. These experts are the  transition house workers who see every day how and where the  system fails to see this abuse.  I recommend that you seriously question the unfounded theories  that maximum contact and joint parenting arrangements are  beneficial to children, as even in cases where there is no abuse, this  can be a way of growing up that is incredibly stressful and unstable  for children. In cases where there is abuse, it is tormenting, dangerous  and even life-threatening.  I recommend that you seriously consider how laws based on the  gender reality of violence do not jeopardize the relationship between  honest, caring fathers and their children. An accurate understanding  of these issues will enable the courts to properly and effectively  protect the safety and well-being of children, and therefore will not  be a threat to fathers who are not, in fact, abusing through the courts.  that he needed us kids. He told me that he  was going to get back at her. I would have  to practise what I would say if anyone  asked me questions about my family.  We went to see a child advocate lawyer  who did an interview with the three of us  kids while my dad waited outside. On our  way to the office, we went over and over  possible questions and answers. We told the  lawyer that we hated our mom and that we  wanted to live with our dad. We told him  that she had left us for another man.  There was another time I remember  being in court, in a room with the judge,  the lawyers and my mom. My dad was  waiting outside. I knew what I had to say. I  stood up and yelled at my mom. I was furious at her because I was so alone. My father used me in my pain, and gave me  words to express his hatred. I said that she  was a bad mother. That she was a "bitch."  That she abandoned us. My father was  awarded interim sole custody.  Once my mother was gone, my dad  turned to me and my brothers for emotional  support and started to completely pull us  into his world. My dad had beat, humiliated, tortured and controlled my mother  during their 13-year marriage.  He had never hit me or my brothers  until he took us away from our mother.  Once she was gone, it was up to us to re  ceive the blows of his fists and his mind  games. He told me that I was his wife now.  He became emotionally and physically incestuous. We used to watch porno movies  in our house. I was less than 10 years old.  He used to plan with us tactics to  frighten or hurt my mother when she  would have visits with us. He said that we  would prove that she was unfit. We would  be rewarded for running away while she  had us or calling her a "bitch" and telling  her to "fuck off." There were times when  he would even buy us things or give us  money if we threw things at her when she  came to the house. I remember seeing the  pain in her eyes when we did this.  It was because my father had the  money to hire very expensive lawyers, and  because he was driven by vengeance, that  he got custody. These people didn't believe  my mother when she said that he abused  her, nor when she told them she was afraid  that he was abusing us too. They didn't  believe her when she said that he was following her and harassing her. But it was  all true. We used to go for outings in the  evenings to find out where she was and  slash her tires, or sugar her gas tank.  These are some of the ways that he created the perception that she was an unfit  mother. She looked like she was paranoid  and trying to accuse him of outrageous  things. But they were all true.  It was all a continuation of the abuse  of her and a way for him to destroy her,  with us children and the court system as  the weapons. My father was awarded permanent sole custody.  My brother certainly didn't benefit from  having this good and loving father. In his teen  years, he began to hit his girlfriends, abuse  alcohol and drugs, perform criminal acts,  and finally he put a gun in his mouth and  killed himself at the age of twenty-four.  There were times when I envied him,  in his ability to completely escape. I ran  away at 13, and moved far away from  where I grew up. I had to change my name  and hide, like a battered wife.  I cannot imagine a worse result of my  parents' court case than the one that happened. I would have preferred to have  never seen my father for the rest of my life.  I would have preferred to never watch him  beat and humiliate my brother to death. I  absolutely needed my mother.  For years, I thought and hoped that this  was an isolated incident, that my family had  slipped through the cracks. Since I began  working in this field, I have been profoundly  disappointed to see that this is not true.  Written briefs by individuals or groups  can be submitted to the Committee up until  June 30.

Feature  Women and natural building:  Healthy, happy cob homes  by Kelly Haydon   Spring and Elisa Shine and their three-  and-a-half year old daughter Dawn Skye  have been building their own cob home in  Argenta (north of Nelson), British Columbia. Two-and-a-half years ago, they became  part of a land share group. Then several  weeks later, they saw an ad for a cob workshop. They started to build as soon as they  got back from the workshop. As Shine says,  "for women cob is wonderful; it is so empowering."  Cob is similar to adobe in that it uses  the same materials: sand, clay, straw and  water. But with adobe, bricks are made and  sun dried, then built into walls with a "coblike" mortar. Cob, on the other hand, is a  wet mixture put on by hand or "massaged"  onto a foundation, creating thick load-bearing walls. The walls are built round, making the walls much stronger. "It's like hand-  sculpting a big pot to live in." (from The  Cob Builders Handbook).  Earthen homes are common in Asia,  India, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and  South and Central America. In fact, at least  one-third of the world's population live in  homes of unbaked earth. For thousands of  years prior to the entrenchment of patriarchy, women made their own homes. Today,  this is still the case in many communities  around the world.  Building with cob is not new either. In  Europe, it has been around for 800 years.  Many cob structures built in the 16th and  17th centuries are still standing today. In  England, there are approximately 50,000  cob buildings still in use today. With the  advent of brick construction, the skill of cob  building almost died out. However, since  the early 1980s, there has been a revival of  cob building especially among women.  The materials you use for cob, except  for straw, are usually culled from the land  you are going to build on. Some land may  not have much clay, so you may have to  have it trucked in.  When most people imagine a cob  home, they think "mud," but the truth is  it's far more beautiful. Furniture, such as a  couch or seat, can easily be moulded into  the wall as you build. Fireplaces and ovens are cobbed in as well. If you want a  bookshelf, you only have to sculpt it into  the wall and it is lovely to put little nooks  around the room to place candles in.  And with cob, it is wonderfully easy  to change your mind. One woman built a  window sill on the inside but a month later  decided she didn't like it and moved it to  the outside. After a while, she decided she  really didn't like that either, so she lopped  it off and re-cobbed one on the inside.  In addition to furniture, you can sculpt  in relief images. A feline lover moulded a  huge cat languorously hanging above her  archway with its tail hanging down the  side. In another home, giant women were  sculpted around the room in a circle with  their arms raised to the sky as if they were  holding up the ceiling. Essentially, you can  sculpt anything your heart desires and your  creativity imagines.  Interestingly shaped windows are really easy to do too. You can literally take a  jagged piece of broken glass, tape the edges  so you don't cut yourself, and cob it into  place. Glass bottles can be buried in the wall  to let in a variety of coloured light.  Embedding loved objects also adds a  beauty to your home. For example, tiles can  be sunk into a cob window sill or a mosaic  can be made from broken tiles. Bits of coloured glass, shells, beads and rocks can be  Another good reason for cob is that "it  doesn't require a lot of skill," says Bee. "It  requires common sense, attention and  working with nature, which women are inherently brilliant at. Learning to build with  cob is as much a matter of relaxing, as it is  of withdrawing from all the stuff you have  learned about how hard it is to build and  Billie Miracle's studio in Oregon: from the outside and the inside  lodged into the surface of walls, ceilings  and furniture. Really, you can embed anything you want—even kitchen utensils.  Reasons to cob  There are many great reasons to build your  home with cob and the foremost, particularly  for women, is that it is cheap. Billie Miracle's  300-square foot studio in Oregon cost just over  $3,000 Cdn to build. Cob is also healthy to live  in and if s great for the planet. Using cob reduces the use of wood, steel and toxic building  supplies.  Further, "making homes with natural  materials gathered gently from the earth  improves the likelihood of survival itself,"  says Becky Bee, who runs workshops on  cobbing for women and is the author of The  Cob Builders Handbook. Using recycled materials also brings down the cost of building. Windows can be scavenged and you  can even bury a car door in a cob wall, leaving the window and nob exposed so you  can roll it down for a breath of fresh air.  Tires can be used as roofing tiles or filled  with earth for a foundation, and oil drums  can be made into stoves.  how technical it is and just letting yourself  do it."  Elisa Shine stresses that anyone can do  it. She says they have had two and three-  year olds helping out on their home as well  as 80-year old women.  Cob homes are safe from hazards such  as fire—mud doesn't burn. A round structure is also safer from earthquakes than  "progressive/civilized" buildings because  the whole structure tends to move in unison. In New Zealand, an 80-year old cob  home sits on a fault line and there are no  cracks. Building a cob home is also safe  because no machinery is involved.  The physical act of cobbing is great for  the body too. The constant, slow, rhythmic  movements build up your body. Shine says  she finds it very healing to work with clay  and mud. It is "a direct way of touching  the earth." One women who had been dealing with anorexia found she had gained  30 pounds after several months of cobbing,  and some participants say their arthritis  was alleviated.  Probably the most compelling reason  to take up cobbing is that it is fun to create  your own home. Shine thinks cob is great  because it brings out the creative side. You  get to uncover aspects of yourself, such as  inventor, artist, inspired creator, designer,  organizer, homemaker. Cobbing can help  you develop confidence in the many facets  of your being—facets that our society leaves  little room to explore.  You can also build smaller structures  with cob as an introduction or if you don't  have the space to build something larger.  Cob outdoor ovens are popular and can  take on a variety of faces. Other cobbing  projects include pavilions, garden benches,  outdoor baths, saunas, life-size garden  sculptures, and just about anything you  might dream up.  Women and cob  "Cob is a very feminine form of building," says Shine. "There are no right angles;  ifs completely round." She finds cobbing  easy for women because "it's very flowing;  it's an art form," and muses (but doesn't  want to generalize) that it may be in our nature to be rounded.  Becky Bee concurs. Whenever she has  a workshop, the vast majority of people  who come are women. "It calls to women."  Her goal is to turn as many women onto  cob as possible. She is the founder of  Groundworks, which builds, teaches workshops and hosts natural building symposiums in the US, Australia and New Zealand.  This June Bee will host the Third Women's  Natural Symposium in Washington State,  a few hours north of Seattle. She will also  be at the Michigan Women's Festival this  August to share/demonstrate/choreograph a cob bench sculpture.  Bee teaches women to build cob because she feels that if women have their  own homes they are less likely to sell their  souls to patriarchy. "Too many women are  dependent on men for their shelter—either  to build it or pay for it—and they are also  dependent on the whole patriarchal structure for housing," says Bee. "Cob is a way  to make women having a home easier and  you end up with something that isn't just a  box full of toxins and destructive energy."  In addition to seeing cob as a means to  independent living, she feels that cob building, when done collectively by groups of  women, is a vehicle for social change. "It  forges a link between women as they are  pulling mother earth out of the ground into  the walls of home,"says Bee.  Women building together is a way to  reweave lost connections between women,  in a society that is constructed to keep us  separated. It also reminds women of what  it feels like to be part of a team action creating life-promoting shelter.  Bee teaches in a non-patriarchal manner. There is no expert, and co-creation is  the rule (or lack thereof). Louise Thauvette,  who attended Bee's last symposium in Oregon, explains: "Becky's whole teaching  style was one of the most pleasant learning  see COB next page COB from previous page  experiences I have ever had in my entire  life. Although she has a vast array of knowledge, skill and experience, she doesn't portray herself as the expert—she is not 'the  teacher' and we 'the student.' She has a lot  of respect and value for everybody's  knowledge and experience, and encourages everybody to trust their own ability  and skill and to believe in themselves."  Another aspect of Bee's teaching is that  she encourages women to work with nature and imitate nature in design. She  points out that nature rarely uses a straight  line and rounded walls are much stronger.  She mentions the brilliant design of the  honeycomb of wasps' nests as an example  of how to maximize space and minimize  indoor walls.  To learn how to cob, women can take  workshops, but as they cost money they  are not accessible to everyone. Bee says she  wrote her book The Cob Builders Handbook:  You Can Sculpt Your Own Home to make cob  building more accessible to women. The  book is generously sprinkled with beautiful and instructive illustrations, and the  language is not only straight-forward and  void of jargon, but is also imbued with enthusiasm. The reader constantly has the  thought: "I can do this."  About the book, environmental writer  Beth Bosk comments: "I'm not used to ex-  She adds that a woman with a physical disability could not build her own  home alone, but there is no reason she can't  with friends and to build communally in  "the spirit of cob."

"There is nothing historically more  traditional nor environmentally benign as  cob or earthen homes." She adds, "if you  are building your own home, you are going to build it to last."

Cob housing can be a beautiful way for women to gain  independence while living within the simplicity Mother Nature requires of us.

Instructions  and line drawings are so easily absorbed,  that I can pass them on to someone else,  Bee says that cob is really easy, and she  wants to share that with people. "So many  books you read about the techniques of  building make it sound so hard and impossible and frustrating. And also, they leave  out pieces of information, almost like it is a  plot. So I wrote a book that is fun, simple  and explains every little bit."  Another way to learn that doesn't cost  money is to volunteer to help someone  build their home.  Accessibility still an issue  Although building with cob itself is  more cost accessible than other forms of  construction, barriers do still exist. Few  women can afford land to build on. One  option is to build on community land or  become part of a land share group. Even  so, not all women, even communally, have  access to land.  Louise Thauvette says of her stay on  women's land in Oregon "the initial thing  that really struck me was the vast majority  of white women and the lack of women of  colour at the symposium." Although building with cob is a solution to part of the problem, there is the wider issue of money and  land. It is usually white-middle-class people who can afford land to build on. (Bee  herself does not have land to build on.)  Cobbing may also not be an option for  some women who are physically disabled.  In terms of accessibility to her workshops,  Bee says: "Who can participate depends on  the building site. If the structure is to be built  upon an incline, then it may be impossible  to rest a wheelchair there. However, at times,  it is possible to dig out a flat area beside the  cob wall so a woman can work on it. As the  wall gets higher, temporary ramps can be  built of straw bales."  Rural women have more access to this  form of affordable housing, as building a  cob home in the city now is not very feasible. Building with cob is hindered by the  male-dominated construction industry and  its building codes. It is difficult to get a permit to build a cob house.  It is ironic that cob homes, which easily stand for a lifetime and are healthy to  live in, are not acceptable, whereas condos  jammed to the rafters with highly toxic and  flammable materials and which rot within  a year are.  So far, the cob homes Bee has been involved with have not come under condemnation from building inspectors. One in  New Zealand was condemned for not  building to code, but was later pardoned.  Bee believes in magic, and mentions a cob  home that was built within a housing subdivision of a US city. To date, there has been  no concern from building officials.  Elisa Shine says they recently had a  visit from a building inspector. She says  they were given two options: to have their  home structurally engineered and receive  a permit, or do nothing and have it written  on the deed that their home does not comply with code (This means, they can't resell, or get insurance or bank financing).  Having a cob home engineered strikes  Bee as needlessly expensive and socially  flawed. The issue of codes "takes power  away from women by involving inspectors  and engineers." She likes the idea of people building their own homes without over-  Almost ready for the roof  Cobbing "Down Under" (Australia)  is like wa  Fitting windows into the cob walls  Becky Bee  Commonly asked questions about cob  Medusa and her outdoor cob oven and matching bench  Cob home building can be a very radical movement, but like all ideas it can be  co-opted. There are cob "experts" who  teach in ways that result in "students" who  feel they are not expert enough to talk about  cob, let alone build it. There are also those  who advocate the building of large 3,000-  Kelly Haydon's head feels full of cob: 57 percent sand, 43 percent clay, a cup of straw, and  a splash of water.  How long does it last?  Cob homes will last at least as long as you  do. Many last hundreds of years.  Won't it melt in the rain?  Many cob homes that have lasted lifetimes  are built in some of the wettest climates  such as Wales and England. The only time  cob houses are negatively affected by rain  is if the foundation has been not been properly done and water pools. A good roof is  also important. But these two points are  true for any type of housing.  Can I put electricity and plumbing  in and can I have a flush toilet?  If you want electricity or plumbing you must  lay in some pipes through the width of the  wall or foundation at the beginning of the  building process. Putting in plumbing is just  like for any other house, only easier.  Can I build in the colder snowier  regions of Canada?  As the climate gets colder and colder, cob  gets less and less efficient and thus harder  and harder to heat. It would be similar to  living in a stone house. You need insulation. One solution proposed by cobber  Mitch Spiralstone of Regina is to put in extra long eaves and in the winter surround  the house with straw bales. When the temperature rises in the Spring you can simply unbale yourself.  Can I have a second story?  Of course. There are many two-story cob  houses existing today. One popular design is a  clerestory, which is a home with a sleeping loft  Can I build in the city?  There is no reason you can't build in the  city. However, the small size of land you  are apt to have may make it necessary to  truck in your supply of earth and clay.  Whether the city building inspector will let  you live in it is another matter.  Will my feet get dirty on the mud  floor?  No. You seal the floor with linseed oil or  you can put in tiles, flat stones, et cetera. Feature  Louise Thauvette:  Doing the cob dance  Louise Thauvette attended the Second Women's Natural Building Symposium in southern  Oregon last summer. She had never heard of cobbing  until she saw the event advertised.  What was your experience of being at the symposium?  One of the first things we did was to  plan the week's agenda: what the women  present wanted to learn, what they wanted  to teach, facilitate and spend their days  working on. On the second day, we started  playing in mud and that was certainly a  highlight. That is the heart of it for me: to  rip your boots and socks off and roll up  your pants and stomp in the mud and mix  it all together. You do this with other  women and it's called the cob dance. I love  doing the cob dance.  What was it like building/working with women?  I've always imagined that any kind of  building was way out of my scope of possibility. I've never built anything before,  other than with fabric or food, so I was quite  intimidated by the whole idea of building  because it's "boy's work." It is indescribable what it's like to be with a group of  women building because it's a group of  women doing what is very taboo: independently building their own homes in a  non-traditional and a very womanly way.  During the symposium, I always felt  comfortable, I never felt stupid, I never felt  like I didn't know enough to participate,  and I always felt it was okay to ask questions. Part of the teaching method was that  women teach women teach women. For example, I may have just learned something  from a woman and then I pass that information and knowledge to you and then you  pass it on to the next woman who comes  along. We all become teachers and facilitators  and learners at the same time. It's shared;  it's communal and it's lovely! There also  wasn't a set plan about what the building  would look like in the end, so this gave room  for women to experiment, create and develop  as we went along. It changes and it moves.  It's organic and it's creation.  Men don't work that way and have no  knowledge of working that way.

Recently, I attended a cob information  event in Vancouver and was struck by the  difference. There were no women in positions of leadership, and that evening  there were presenters, a slide show and  an audience. There was a very clear delineation of where the expertise lay and  where the lack of expertise lay.  It was so contrary to my experience  at Groundworks last summer, where we  worked cooperatively and collectively together. I spent the whole night shaking my  head wondering, "what are they doing?  This isn't the way it is supposed to be."  Any other experiences you would  like to share?  What did happen for me throughout  the week was I laughed more than I have  laughed my entire life. I liked myself better that week than I have in many, many  years, and I felt more connected to myself  and the women around me. I had more joy  and was more open than I thought possible. When I came back my partner wanted  me to take her back where I had just been,  because she couldn't believe the transformation I had gone through. I tend to be a  little uptight; I lost that when I was there. I  became really relaxed and very content.  What it did for me, Louise, how it made  me feel, and the confidence and joy it gave  me became more important than the dream  of building my house.  And the food was incredible. Sushi, Pad  Thai all cooked in a makeshift outdoor kitchen!  Where are you now in terms of  your dream since the symposium?  The dream for me was about rhubarb  and a place where I could plant it in the  ground and see it the next year. I want a  place where I can do that. When you rent,  you don't know whether you will still be  there the next year. But how to afford land  with a house? Forget it! I thought that the  only thing I could maybe afford someday  was a condo; a crappy little condo somewhere. Now, you couldn't put me in a  condo for the world. There is no way.  Louise Thauvette and her one-cookie oven  Line drawings on pages 12-14 courtesy c/The Cob Builders Handbook Feature  Women and our breasts:  The dangers of 34DD  by Nancy Parker  Summer is here and the sun is hot and,  "look out," the women are all flinging off  their....  "Women Baring Aggressive Breasts  Beware," was the front page headline in the  Victoria News, July 9 [1997] edition. It certainly caught my eye and caused me to  think about the implications and how they  could affect my summer fun out riding and  at the many rodeo events.  It seems that if a topless woman is in a  public place, it's likely that she could be  arrested, and then Crown Counsel will decide whether or not to pursue the charges.  The Crown Counsel Policy Manual recommends leniency, unless the woman "demonstrates an aggressive approach to nude  exhibitionism."  I find it ridiculous that the Attorney  General's Office would spend tax dollars  debating what makes breasts illegal. As I  look down at my own bosom, they seemed  pretty peaceable, even somewhat ho-hum.  So I thought that maybe I needed a better  understanding of the word "aggressive"  and looked it up in my dictionary.  Webster's describes aggressive as: assertive,  hostile, pushy, energetic, determined, en  terprising, warlike, contentious, forward,  militant, macho, domineering, powerful  and dynamic.  Armed with this new knowledge, I  spent the day doing some deep thinking  and even soul searching about the "sort"  of breasts I've been sporting all these years.  Are they aggressive?  Once, on a cold day, my left nipple did  force itself through the lace of my bra. Was  this a sign that my nipples have been quietly awaiting a chance for a break to freedom? Are they assertive, hostile and pushy?  Have they been meeting secretly to plan  their escape?  I personally think that for a mound of  flesh without any visible means of mobilization, my breasts are pretty energetic and  determined. I often find them bursting over  the top of my bra or sneaking out between  the buttons of my shirt. They seem to have  no trouble being able to free themselves from  the confines of a brassier, while most men  with ten fingers can't get the damn thing off!  They're pretty enterprising too! Without the least bit of help from the rest of my  person, they have been able to attract many  unsolicited mugs of beer.

VOP 1K0 • CANADA  Is it the fact that I wear a 34DD cup  bra, and could probably do some damage  to a person or property if I was flung breast  first from a speeding motorcycle, just cause  to name my breasts warlike or contentious?  (Should they wear helmets?) Wouldn't that  be excusable since it was Mother Nature  that provided the "weapons"? I think it is  part of our human rights as Canadians to  have whatever size breasts we can afford  without Crown Counsel labelling them  "wilfully non-compliant with the law."  And to top it off, I don't think that  small breasts could ever be considered "forward" or "militant." A pair of teeny titties  have a hard enough time getting attention,  let alone causing trouble. I've seen plenty  of them in the riding community and  they've never scared me.  A pair of breasts that did scare me were  on a woman at the Pig n' Fin (an annual  motorcycle rodeo event held in Coombs,  BC) that had a frosting of dark curly hair  in her cleavage. Now, that's aggressive,  macho and domineering!  Everyone who knows me is aware  that, on occasion, I leave my bra at home  or sometimes even tied to someone's handlebars. Is this aiding and abetting a pair  of criminals? It makes sense to me—the  force of gravity that pulls those heavy babies closer to my navel each year can also  be used to pull all the wrinkles out of my  face. I think it proves they're very powerful and dynamic!  So why all this new concern about tits?  I've had mine for 40 years without much  trouble. I think the law should let those that  own them be responsible. Most people with  "trouble-makers" could easily find help  keeping them at home under house arrest.  Is the public really all that concerned  that women might decide to go topless all  the time? I don't think so. I just got people  used to the idea that when I've got my butt  out mooning a passerby, that, just like Mel  Gibson in Braveheart, I'm showing off my  Scottish side.

They could be heard resonating from  deep below the hollow cement corridors of  Robson Square Media Centre, where a full  house was gathered for the premiere of  Annie Frazier Henry's new film, Singing  Our Stories.  The diverse audience which came  looking for truth was treated to an exhilarating visual and musical odyssey through  the eyes and mouths of Native North  American women.  Singing Our Stories is a ground breaking one-hour documentary, that takes viewers on a visionary journey through the landscape of North American Native song and  into the personal lives of the "First Ladies"  of indigenous music.  The premiere exemplified the collective teaching of true power. All women—  the grandmothers, mothers, daughters,  aunties, nieces and sisters—shared the gift  of storytelling and teaching through song.  The film features live performances and interviews with women singers, songwriters  and performers, all sharing their message  through the universal voice.  As rock icon and two time Grammy  Award winner Rita Coolidge stated: "We are  only three  women, and  we are doing  the best we can  to make a difference. I believe and  know that Native people are  still very much  ignored—  probably more  than any other  group in North  America—for  our contributions."  "We" refers to Walela,  the vocal group  comprised of  Rita Coolidge,  her sister  Priscilla  Coolidge, and  her niece Laura  Satterfield.  Those who attended the premiere were treated  to an incredible performance by these three  women  Together, the trio eloquently brings to  life the spirit of their Cherokee heritage.  Their remarkable musical delivery combines a blend of pop, gospel and Native  American influences.  Singing Our Stories opens with the  sound of the oldest recorded Indian song:  a healing song by a Sioux medicine man  by the name of Brave Buffalo. The old wax  cylinders and a dramatic re-enactment of  archival photos prove that Native people  have not lost these traditions.  As ethnomusicologist Judith Gray of  the American Centre of the Library of Con-  Breana Yamutewa of the Zuni Old  Maidens  gress is quoted in the film, says: "Tradition  lives precisely because it can adapt."  Through their language, heritage and  homelands, the stories and songs of the  Gina Gasongi Simon [second from left] felt great honour meeting Rita Coolidge [left],  and Laura Satterfield and Priscilla Coolidge  women in Singing Our Stories link the past  to the present as they trace the voices of  their ancestors. At each stop on the journey, we meet and pay tribute to the women  who preserve and carry the precious musical archive of their peoples.  The experience allows the viewer a  glimpse from a bird's eye view of the Monk-  Sanders Family Singers from the Tuscarora  Nation celebrating on the front porch of  their grandmother's house. This singing  group emulates the passing of music from  one generation to the next as the seven  members represent four generations of  singing daughters.  The a cappella  trio Ulali joins this musical bluesy, rhythmic  and joyful celebration.  Rattles, rather than  drums, are used as accompaniment.  "There is nothing  more beautiful to me  than being able to sing  c with my family," says  § Pura Fe. "That is really  -§ the strongest connection  £ for me and where my songs come from"  .2        In a teepee on sacred Sundance territory  gj of the Blood Nation, we experience the pow-  fc: erful Headdress songs of the Buffalo Wom-  ^ en's Society and the  ^ haunting harmony of  j2 the Women Singers of  g Drummers   of  Old  | Agency.  J Bringing this mu-  ^sical odyssey a little  closer to home, we  travel by water to the  magnificient Northwest Coastal village of  Alert Bay (British Columbia), home of the  eternal strength of the  'Namgis Singers'. During the 'Namgis Singers' live performance at the premiere, the  audience  witnessed  the passing of  song, as  one little  boy  strained  his neck  to get  closer to  the micro-  phone,  and his  mother  obliged  him by readjusting  its height.  It was a  real treat  to hear  this little  boy harmonize  on cue  with his  mother  "We are only three  women, and we are  doing the best we  can to make a  difference"  — Rita Coolidge —  "There is nothing  more beautiful to  me than being  able to sing with  my family"  — Pura Fe —  and aunties.  Back to the film...arriving by air, our  journey takes us to spectacular spiritual landmark where the Zuni people have celebrated  for thousands of years—the magnificent  mesa Dowa Yallane. The Zuni Olla Maidens  perform in an open space, using an indigenous instrument known as the frog box.  Their colours and poise are something  to be seen, as they reverently walk down the  mountainside with clay pottery balanced on  their heads. The entire scene is of wonder  and grace, as they never miss a beat.  Cornelia Bowannie, a traditional singer  and celebrated jeweller, provides the vocal and rhythm on  drum. Her daughter's quote epitomizes how sacred the  teachings and passing of songs is to  North American Native women. "I will  always be grateful to  my mother because  she's the one who  taught us our songs  and taught us our dances. And through her,  I think I've made a commitment to this  community, because I will live and die  here."  After seeing the  women of Walela sitting around the  kitchen table singing  the songs of their  Cherokee grandmother, the moment  of truth came when,  after the film screening, the audience had  the privilege of mee  ing Rita Coolidge i  person.  She is a humbl  woman, as anyone who had the opporti  nity to meet and talk with her can attes  The line-up in front of her was long, bi  Rita Coolidge remained until every albun  every autograph was signed, and ever  photo was taken.  During an earlier interview we ha  scheduled, Rita shared her innermost fee  ings about ground breakers and shaker  "As the world changes, not much has r<  ally changed in terms of people and the  treatment of others.

I, and a lot of other people, would lov  to see our contributions acknowledged ;  the American Music Awards or the Can;  dian Music Awards.

Her sister Priscilla was quick to adc  "The history books don't tell the truth, an  until enough people come to terms with th  healing and admittance of what has gori  on, it will remain an unspoken truth."  Annie Frazier Henry has this to ad  about her sixth film: "The idea of havin  or finding your song has been part of N<  five spirituality for thousands of years. M  goal was to invite the viewer on a visior  ary journey through the first teacher (  song—the landscape, with all its divers  and magnificent elements."

This year's  festival, held between April 23 and May 2,  screened 112 works from 26 countries, many  of which were premiers. The titles presented in  the 17 new screen program reflected some challenging, provocative and cutting edge work.  Images was founded in  1988 to provide an exhibition  forum for "marginalized"  works—films and videos by  women, people of colour, gays  and lesbians.  Below, Sheila James and  Melina Young chat about a  few of the films and videos  made by women and screened  in this year's festival as part  of the "360 Degrees Women"  program. James is a writer  and theatre worker presently  living in Vancouver. Young is  an independent video artist  living in Toronto.  TOP OF THE WORLD  Marjorie Kaye, USA  This 17-minute short  tells the story of Shannon, the  new girl in town, who fixates  on winning the heart of bad  girl Rannd. The film depicts  the seduction of Rannd and  portrays butch/femme roles  with a humorous twist.  Young: It was cute and  fun. It's nice to see something that was so plainly by dykes, for  dykes in a dyke culture, though it was a  dyke culture that was almost dated. For instance, there was a slightly grungy lesbian  cafe, bookstore, bar, coffee shop...  James: Yeah...with a collective feel. I  Liked how conscious the film was of its own  corniness. For example, the hero Shannon,  shows up when Rannd is having a fight  with her girlfriend. She just happens to be  in the right place at the right time. Its so  obviously contrived.  Young: Yeah, if it came out a decade  ago, it would have fit right in with my experience, my own sense of lesbianism and  the lesbian world. Now, I see it differently—  the scenes like where the new woman  (Shannon) volunteers to help clean up and  then Rannd, who is supposed to clean up,  just sits there and watches her for an hour I  see it now as problematic. There are control issues to consider.  James: But they're conscious of that;  that's the whole S&M parallel, right? That's  the humour. When Rannd points out a stain  that Shannon missed, the power relationship is being satirized.  SHOOT ME ANGEL  Amal Bedjaoui, France  This nine-minute short is called "an erotic  urban allegory," where a white police woman  pursues a Black woman down a city street, and  the interaction between them moves from violence to desire.  James: This is a disturbing film. The  opening images of this Black person fleeing  a white person with a gun sets up the racist  power dynamic that goes through the whole  film. For me, it didn't work because while  it's supposed to be this erotic urban allegory,  there's nothing erotic about racism.  Young: The gun was always a member.  You might say a participant.  James: We see this dynamic too much in  real life to make me want to watch it on film.  MY CUNT  Deb Strutt and Liz Baulch, Australia  from My Feminism  It was hard to watch. The threat of racism and violence is in your face. The white  woman shoots the Black woman in the leg.  Then, it moves to inside an apartment, and  the game of desire and control starts.  Young: I didn't get that they were lovers. In fact,  I thought  they were  going to  kill each  other. It's  interesting  that it's a  French  production. I hate  to generalize, but the  way  French  filmmakers express  racism is it-  self often  "Like rice,  my son  has become a staple.  Sometimes he is the only  one that touches me  all day."  from Veena Cabreros-Sud's  video Stretchmark  through exoticism. I think this was an example of that. It is an opportunity for excitement, erotic tension—all very  objectifying.  James: Yes, the Black woman was stark  naked in the film, and this was coupled  with the violence...  Maude Davey performs a humorous/satirical monologue originally written for stage about  living with a cunt. She questions the ideal of female perfection, deconstructs the beauty myth,  and gives us glimpses into her grandmother's  act of defiance by sewing up her cunt. Winner of  the Audience  Choice Award  at the 1997  Melbourne  Queer Film and  Video Festival.  James: I  loved this one I  must say. They  callita "subversive black comedy," but what-  ever you want  to call it, if s really well performed. The  writing is very  good, and the  filmmaking  and direction is engaging. If s a provocative and  evocative comedy  Young: Australian independent work  often has a quirky sense of humour about  it. At the same time, it's very subtle. It is  possible to express subtle and complex positions without being heavy or taking yourself too seriously. It was light in its form.  James: In its delivery, too.  Young: But also able to discuss important,  complex issues around sexuality and identity.  James: Such as female perfection, body  type. Yeah, it's light, but the levels are deep.  Young: It's 90s in the sense that it is performative. It's feminist and queer at the  same time, which don't always go hand-  in-hand. It's  deconstructivist, and yet it  retains a feminist critique.  It doesn't dissociate itself  from political positioning.  James: It's very clearly  a feminist piece, and I just  love the moral of the story  [laughs.J We're all expecting something really huge  to come out of this and she  says, "Don't shut up your  cunt."  Young: The most basic  feminist message.  STABAT MATER  Olga Samolevskaya,  Ukraine  An experimental film  depicting images of maternal  women and war, evoking  themes of spirituality, creation, maternal love and reincarnations of the soul. Winner of the Best Experimental  Video at Film Video 1997 in  Montekatini, Italy.  James: This film was  one of my favourite pieces. I love the religious images and the maternal images of  pregnant women and girls. Samolevskaya  creates an abstract collage work. It's almost  like a water colour.  Young: The singing was also powerful.  James: Yes, the sound track was good.  It was an experimental work that definitely  grabbed the audience into its theme of  women, motherhood, war and conflict. It  made me think about the whole creation of  life, juxtaposed with the destruction of life.  Young: I liked it, but I also wondered  how much of the context we missed. What  difference would it have made if we knew  the experiences she drew from? There are  historical changes in the Ukraine that she's  actually commenting on. Maybe Canadian  audiences, not having those experiences,  can't appreciate the challenges of placing  women in war, women in huge social upheavals. I felt myself missing something.  Other than that, I found the pace slow, but  I did like the images.  James: I thought there was a lot of resonance not only with what has happened to  the Ukrainian people, but also in parts of  Eastern Europe over the last ten years. For  me, it seems like there is a direct connection that's universal—whether it's civil war  or civil strife in Sri Lanka or in Yugoslavia.  Young: But that's also why I had some  questions.  James:   You   would   have   liked  specificity?  Young: I feel it was a little too simplifying. Arts  A raw and intimate look at the life of a  single mother, exposing taboos of single parenthood, isolation, boredom and anger.  James: This film was first screened at  Desh Pradesh [an annual festival in Toronto  of South Asian politics, culture and art] in  1996. Cabreros-Sud is a Filipino-Indian  writer, film maker and mother from New  York. Her film made me very sad, but I also  found it very honest and courageous—a  single woman struggles with raising her  son.  get it out there," but I was disappointed with  the film. Although all the women interviewed did good work in their lives...  Young: ...and are still doing it now.  James: Yes, I feel we can access their  books, articles, et cetera. This film is obviously for a middle-class and academic audience, and that's its pitfall. The filmmakers missed a whole range of grassroots activists, women from the South, indigenous  women, young women. These women  aren't    fa-  have made it in the mainstream. There were  great things to hear, such as Urvashi Vaid  asserting that the third wave of feminism  must be international...  Young: I don't think it even refreshed  us. Maybe it was a matter of the questions  asked. But I'm not sure why they had Judy  Rebick talking about her experience teach  ing a course in Saskatchewan because she  has done a lot of stuff more interesting. The  material in the film was safe.  James: I agree, but I do have to say, in  these so-called "post feminist" times, creating a film that owns and affirms feminism  has to be commended.  "My grandmother  has an implied cunt."  from Deb Strutt/Liz Baulch's film My Cunt  I  thought the  silence in  the film—  there's very  little noise,  except real  raw urban  noise—illustrated her isolation and boredom. The  fact that her son was often the only person  she communicated with all day was sad. I  thought she communicated her experience  very effectively, telling her stories throughout, especially the one about standing with  her child on the subway train and no one  offering her a seat.  Young: It's emotionally quite heavy.  Maybe it's a story that doesn't get told because women in that position are isolated  and don't have the access or time to do such  a piece.  James: What I liked about it too was that  we rarely see Asian women talking about  being single mothers. I'm sure a lot of people can identify with it. The images were  beautiful.  Young: There were strong, bare images,  urban decay. And there weren't people in  her images.  James: ...just her child, which I suppose  was an accurate portrayal of her life.  Young: I felt like saying, "Get the hell  out of New York."  MY FEMINISM  Laurie Colbert and Dominique Cardona,  Canada  A documentary with clips of women working, marching and living. The film is based on  interviews with leading feminists from Canada,  the US, Ireland and India—Mary Becker,  Urvashi Butalia, bell hooks, Judy Rebick, Ailbhe  Smyth, Gloria Steinem and Urvashi Vaid—  speaking on different issues including health care,  pornography and reproductive   rights.  James: The blurb in  the program states  that we're living  in   a   "post-  feminist"  world, so  the beginning of the  film      is  about being in this  supposedly  post-feminist  stage and asking  young women how  they identify as feminists, if they do. It  made me really  hopeful. I was  thinking,  "yeah, re-  claim  feminism,  mous, but  could have  offered a  wide range  of thoughts  on what it is  to be feminist.  Young: I  could see a conscious attempt to address  the problem of representation, but I don't  think it really worked.  James: I also thought some of the issues  discussed were important, but limited. For  instance, they spoke about reproductive  rights, particularly abortion. Well, abortion  isn't the issue for a lot of women in the  world; basic health care and control over  our bodies is. To me, this has to do with the  filmmakers' editorial decisions. When  Urvashi Butalia, an activist from India, was  speaking about how women in the South  don't want to identify with white feminists,  the filmmakers cut to a picture of a radical  activist, probably the image of a dyke.  Young: ...a leather dyke with short hair...  James: ...yeah, which then suggests that  women in the South aren't lesbians or are  prejudiced against white lesbians...The  filmmakers made a choice there, but I think  it's problematic. Why not cut to a middle  class white feminist in a power suit?  Young: The women interviewed have  done amazing things, but when Gloria  Steinem said she was conscious of feeling  liberated from a deeply held fear of physical violence while on a visit to Tokyo because she was taller than the men, well...I'm  sorry, but most of us don't get a chance to  stroll through Tokyo.  James: One of the things Steinem also  said was that feminism is about revolution  not public relations, but I felt this film  was about public relations. It  was an introduction to  strong women who  A conversation with Images  Executive Director Deirdre Logue  Deirdre Logue: This year, over half  the works in the festival are by women.  Every once in a while, it's really important to remind audiences that there is  still a lot to talk about in terms of gender politics. There's a lot of work being  produced by women and women of  colour that's not hitting the screen  whether it be in broadcast or exhibition  festivals, et cetera.  Melina Young: Is it a way of taking  into account the audiences in Toronto?  Logue:...we don't program themati-  cally to meet needs per se, but we try to  determine what the needs of a very  broad community are. When we make  a decision to program "360 Degrees  Women," it is on the strength of the  works that come in from the call for  submissions. It's up to us to create the  right frame for this work. It's up to us  to make a big fuckin' deal out of it,  right?  The six works in "360 Degree  Women" were chosen from more than  700 submissions. They're pretty close to  the top twenty works. To seize that  moment is our responsibility. To sit  down and see twelve works from all  over the world by women gives a really interesting sense of whafs happening overall [in the world of independent film and video.]  Young: Do you think there are more  women...  Logue: ...than men  making film and v  video?  Young: Perhaps, or at least, that  there's been some kind of change?  Logue: I think film and video practice is becoming more and more accessible every day, but as it becomes more  accessible and as people use the mediums more, we also encounter new  problems. It's sort of six of one and half  a dozen of the other.  Take someone like Lynne Chan,  whose piece, Untitled (My Mama), was  screened in the closing night program.  It's a very raw work, right? She ran  around with a Hi-8 camera. It's a mess  technically, but the concepts that drive  the work are really profound. So you  get a range now in terms of practice,  from total technical breakdown, really  raw work, low gauge sensibilities to really high production 35 mm.  Young: Would you like to say  something about the way the women's  programming was put together?  Logue: The [women's program] curators, Michelle Mohabeer, Kika  Thorne and Kathleen Smith, put together some really strong program^  with "360 Degrees Women" and the  women's animation program. Having  women in curatorial positions is very  important.  We took six tapes from the festival  and screened them at the Women's Art  Resource Centre for the duration of the  festival. The women's work in this festival was most successful in that way. It  was really strong  work and a lot of  people got to see  it. Other women  get inspired by a  piece in the festi-  I     val, then they  f     borrow their best  I     friend's Super 8  camera, and then  it's in next year's  festival — you  know, there's a  continuum there,  and that's one of its  real pluses, for sure.

Love,  Kinesis  TG discussion needs  compassion  Dear Kinesis,  [re: "The struggle for women-only  space" in the March 1998 issue.]  I'm glad this issue is being raised  and I'm quite disturbed by some of the  comments. I have a number of points  to make, although they are far from all  that needs to be said.  I am concerned about how this issue  is being discussed. If we do not do this  well and with compassion, we will  have yet another energy draining fight  that will leave women with less to give  and drive women away from doing  political work at all.  It is dismissive to speak of a decision to  take hormones as "popping hormones"—  as if it were a decision people take lightly  Although I agree there need to be a lot  more conversations, it is important to me  that people's decisions are not analysed  away as some kind of false consciousness.  As for women using legal suits to  gain access to women's groups: I'm  having difficulty with a whole group  of people being condemned for the  actions of some of its members. I  believe the criticism ought to be  levelled at the strategy, and not be used  as a way to slam transgendered  women in general. I'm critical of  transgendered women suing women's  groups, just as I'm critical of any other  women using the legal system against  each other in this kind of way.  Although I understand that in this  climate of legal suits that it is difficult  for organizations to make a public  stand, I am disturbed at the  implications that transgendered  women have been resorting to violence  against individuals who disagree with  them. If that is true then those  individuals ought to be exposed. If it is  not, then we need to be very careful  not to escalate hostility.  I do think we should welcome  transgendered women and deal with the  behaviour just as we deal with  obnoxious behaviour from any other  woman who has some relative degree of  privilege. I don't believe it is the same  thing as welcoming men into women's  organizations...very few transgendered  women have grown up fully enjoying  the fruits of being male (although some  have). Most have grown up targeted for  being different, for not being a real male.  I'd rather see us spending our  energy telling someone who is  basically an ally that something is not  OK, thus ending up with one more  woman doing the work that needs to  be done, than spending our energy  fighting with each other about whether  someone is a real woman and whether  we're willing to deal with her, or not.  I do agree that growing up female and  growing up transgendered is a different  experience and some  transgendered women do  not acknowledge this, and  that's not OK However,  some do and some do not Just  as lots of white women, middle  class women, heterosexual women,  able bodies women don't  acknowledge their privilege.  This whole issue illustrates some of  the inherent difficulties in identity  politics and binary thinking about  gender. Some things just don't fit. And  when something doesn't fit, I think we  need to stretch our analysis and if we  can't get our head around it all, then  we need to make decisions from a  place of compassion—even if we can't  make our analysis line up.  If gender were constructed solely  from socialization, then my very 50s  gender socialization would have  resulted in a very conventional female  gender identity. That's not who I am.  It seems utterly illogical to say that  transgendered women wanting to be in  women's groups is about their male  socialization. All other marginalized  groups of women have pushed to have  voice and visibility in women's groups  and have usually only gone away to  make our own groups out of despair.  I agree the issue is complex. I agree it  doesn't come clearly through the lens of  gender analysis. I agree there will need to  be some accommodations made and that  we must push for help to do that...and  surely there is a better response than "go  away—you don't fit." Surely feminism is a  big enough house to add another room  and to find a way to go forward with  creativity and compassion.  The bottom line reality is that there  is a group of people who are not male,  not living as men, who are living as  women, who identify as women, who  may have varying degrees of male  socialization (although quite frankly, I  don't see a lot of difference between  the arrogance and sense of entitlement  based on race or class, and that based  on gender), and who get targeted  because they are not men.  I don't have to believe that her  experience is the same as mine to work  with her—as long as what we are  agreed on our focus. I think we'd have  more to gain from talking about our  similarities and differences than in  arguing over who is or isn't real. We  both are targeted and we both have an  investment in changing things.  Bet Cecill  Vancouver, BC  No help resolving  dilemma  Dear Kinesis,  As an editor myself, I hesitate to  criticize another editorial decisions, but  I can't get the article "The struggle for  women-only space" off my mind, so I  am putting my thoughts to paper.  First, the issue of transgendered  lesbians: Either we include them in the  definition "women," or we don't. Since  we can't include them in the category  of "men," then either they are women  or something else all together.  I found this article to be a classic  example of the sort of yellow journalism  that I expect from BC Report, not Kinesis.  It uses fear-mongering, demonizing the  "enemy," obfuscation, and many  unsupported statements attributed to  the "other side."  Fear-mongering: Spreading rumours  of threats of violence...has there been  violence or threats of violence against  women or women's groups from the  transgendered community? If so, they  should be exposed and the  perpetrators dealt with. These are  serious accusations, and we deserve to  hear the particulars.  The point the article seemed to be a  fear of losing money—of spreading our  minimal funding too thinly. If these  women are our sisters, how can we  deny them a share of the money?  Demonizing: Placing the  transgendered community on a list that  includes father's rights groups and  false-memory syndrome supporters:  are there any ideological or  organizational links between the TG  community and the far right? I find  this hard to believe, but if so, I'd like to  hear about them.  Obfuscation: the argument was  made that we cannot be "oppressors"  because we are ourselves oppressed.  There are dozens of examples that  make this argument silly. Anticipating  the opposition to one's argument and  discounting it in such a way is a  common technique of the Right (we'll  be called "racist" if we oppose land  claims), but it is not a technique that  feminists should indulge in.  Unsupported Attributions:  Throughout the article, claims were  made about the statements and ideas  of queer politics and the transgendered  community, but not one of them was  attributed to any person or publication.  I question the wisdom of using this  format [of a discussion] to introduce  such an emotionally-charge issue.  Discussions work best for things like  interviews of individual women, or for  groups of women discussing their  personal experiences. It is not a format  that works well for political debate.  Especially, if all the people in the group  are saying the same thing. A discussion  that included the point of view of TG  women would have been more  appropriate, I believe.  I am unsure, myself, about how we  should align ourselves with TG  women. But this article did nothing to  help me resolve the dilemma. Mostly  what it did was make me question my  alignment with the feminist  community. We are being asked to  expand our definitions of ourselves to  include a group of people who may  well be our sisters, who have a  different experience of being female  than we do. Have we become so rigid  that we believe we have already  understood everything there is to  know about the oppression of women?  I applaud Kinesis for at least opening  the debate on this important topic. But  I worry that the tone of this article will  serve to close the debate before it really  begins. If I was a TG woman, I'd  hesitate to speak up after reading that  article. It leaves no opening for  anything except a defensive stance.  The Open Door [of which Quinlan is  editor] is a newsletter for rural  feminists and lesbians. It has no  funding, and so we have no fear of  spreading the money too thinly! If  there are any TG women, particularly  lesbians, out there who are interested  in telling their stories, I'd be happy to  print them.
