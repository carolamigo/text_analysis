The BC New Democrat MP  knew, going into the Senate chambers, that the bill had a good  chance of squeaking through and  worried that the amendment's defeat did not bode well for the pro-  choice side.  When the 43-43 tie was announced (a first for the Senate)  Black thought it was all over; that  the deputy speaker would vote to  break the deadlock and the bill  would pass. When he instead announced that, under Senate rules,  a tie meant defeat, it took a moment to sink in that C-43 was actually dead.  For Black and pro-choice advocates across the country, the high  drama in the Senate was entirely  too close for comfort. In the end,  the fate of Canadian women rested  with a group of mostly men who  very nearly recriminalized abortion. This despite polls that consistently showed the vast majority  of Canadians beheve abortion is  a private matter, and that apparently every presentation (including anti-choice submissions) to the  Senate's legal and constitutional  committees opposed C-43 in one  form or another.  But, like many others, Black  is most frustrated with Justice  Minister Kim Campbell, who she  says reneged on her pro-choice  stance in order to deliver legislation that would make her "one  of the boys." According to Black,  Campbell phoned senators and  even made arrangements to get  into a Conservative senate caucus  meeting to lobby for the bill—a  move Black calls unprecedented.  "So let's be clear," says Black.  "This is something Kim Campbell  was going to deliver to show she  could be trusted."  "...access to abortion  has not improved  one iota since  January 1988 and  may be worse  in some cases..."  Even though C-43 owes its defeat at least in part to anti-choice  Liberals and Conservatives who  wanted even more repressive legislation, a strong pro-choice sentiment, fueled by reports that 50  percent of doctors would stop doing abortions if the bill was passed,  won the day.  That, say feminists, is a testament to years of public education and lobbying around abortion rights and a concerted, national effort to defeat the bill. But,  they add, while C-43's defeat is  a victory for the women's move  ment, access remains a problem  and there is a need to intensify efforts to secure more doctors willing to perform abortions, establish  more free-standing chnics, tackle  anti-choice hospital boards and go  after provincial governments that  attempt to throw up legal and  other barriers.  "It is important for people to  be aware that access to abortion  has not improved one iota since  January 1988 [when the Supreme  Court of Canada struck down the  old abortion law] and may be  worse in some cases due to the  threat of recriminalization," says  Joy Thompson, spokesperson for  the BC Coalition of Abortion Chnics.  With C-43 out of the way,  Thompson says, the coalition can  now get on with the "real issues" including promoting clinics as a better alternative to  hospital-based abortions. She also  wants the movement to keep pressuring Kim Campbell to enforce  the Canada Health Act so that  provinces that refuse to fund abortion services will be penalized in  terms of health transfer payments.  Jane Holmes, executive director  of the Canadian Abortion Rights  Action League (CARAL), agrees  there is much to be done and  warns that women should not  count on C-43's defeat to improve  access at the provincial level.  "Those [provinces] that want  to make it difficult for women  will continue to do so in the  same ways that they have," says  Holmes. "Those that are ready  to open their doors a Uttle more  to allow women to exercise their  rights will do that. But we'll  have to fight harder than ever in  places hke Prince Edward Island,  where no abortions are performed,  Saskatchewan and Alberta."  CARAL's provincial action strategy includes dealing with a rise in  so-called "pregnancy counselhng"  centres that are actually run by  anti- abortionists. A key aim, says  Holmes, is to persuade Yellow  Pages officials to hst abortion services under "abortion" instead of  birth control so that women do not  call the wrong organization.  In BC, activists will make abortion rights a prime issue in the upcoming provincial election.  "We've got to see to it that  people are elected to the legislature who not only profess to be  pro-choice but who have a record  on this issue and who will make  a commitment to our long term  goal of reproductive health chnics  around the province," says Hilda  Thomas, president of the Everywoman's Health Centre Society,  the province's first free standing  abortion clinic.  Adds Thompson: "We'll be ensuring that whoever runs addresses women's reproductive health  needs and that our demands are  made known: full funding for clinics, dealing in a timely manner  See ABORTION page 4  Face it, Kim, you got pied  We got the  Blue budget blues...  by Nancy Pollak  As Kinesis goes to press,  women's groups are bracing themselves for the federal budget in the  full knowledge that governments  which give a httle with one hand  often take a gieat deal with the  other.  In January and February, the  Conservatives certainly gave a httle.  At the end of January, the federal Secretary of State Women's  Program quietly restored $1.2 million for ongoing core funding to  women's centres. When the funding was cut last year, feminists  raised a major cross-country stink  which eventually resulted in the  promise of a year's funding, ending this March.  News of the funding restoration travelled so slowly it didn't  hit the mainstream media for well  over a week. (Kinesis spoke with  a Secretary of State spokesperson  who expressed ignorance about  the funding situation, two days before funding was restored.)  "We suspect the Tories wanted  to discretely buy themselves some  peace and quiet by avoiding another outcry from feminists, especially in the hght of their expenditures in the Gulf war," said Jennifer Johnstone of the Vancouver  Status of Women. "It doesn't look  good to be funding a war and not  funding women's centres."  NDP MP Dawn Black, who criticized the cut to women's centres in Parliament, offered another  angle on the Tories' low-key approach.  "This is only the second time  the Tories have backed down on  a funding cut," said Black, referring to the successful fight-back by  pensioners. "The very clear message is they don't want people to  get the idea that protests—public  protests—work."  Last year's protests worked—to  a point. The Women's Program  also inflicted major cuts to feminist research and advocacy groups  (in both 1989 and 1990), as well as  100 percent cuts to three feminist  magazines and a sports advocacy  organization (in 1990). These cuts  have not been restored.  Research and advocacy groups  once again find themselves wondering whether their remaining  funding will survive the February  26th budget.  These groups include the National Action Committee on the  Status of Women (NAC), the Vancouver Status of Women (Kinesis' publisher), the Women's  Research Centre, the Canadian  Congress of Learning Opportunities for Women, the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, Nouveau Depart  and others.  By contrast, the Tories were  loud and clear about their February announcement of $136 million  over four years for "family" violence programs (many feminists  prefer the term "male").  Health Minister Perrin Beatty  outlined a range of uses for the  money, including training programs for judges and RCMP recruits, new shelters for battered  women and their children, treatment programs for men who batter, and improved public education. The government will also  look into improving legislation so  that the pohce can more readily  remove offenders from the home.  Critics were quick to point out  that, even with this money, the Tories' cuts to social, health and welfare programs were undoing the  abihty of community agencies and  women's groups to deal with violence against women, children and  the elderly.  The Liberal's women's critic,  MP Mary Clancy, called the $136  million program a "drop in the  bucket" compared to the billions of dollars Ottawa has cut  from provincial transfer payments,  which directly affect health and  welfare programs.  Jan Barnsley of the Women's  Research Centre noted that without strong funding for women's  groups, the anti-violence money  may go where women will be  less than well-served. "It's important that the infrastructure of  the women's movement be supported if that money is to be  used wisely, " said Barnsley. "The  money should go to the community level, not to academic researchers or clinical treatment."  Funding for women's groups is  only a small part of the dangers facing women in the budget. Finance Minister Michael Wilson is unlikely to swerve from  his established anti-deficit hne of  thinking, which translates into  spending cuts to social programs  and government services. Don  Blenkarn, Tory chair of the House  of Commons finance committee,  also favours cuts and Ontario's  Tory MPs have called on Ottawa  to discontinue all funding to Native, women's and other advocacy  groups.  KINESIS  March 91 NEWS  Vancouver:  Anti-war activism abounds  by Joni Miller  In BC, peace activists are involved in a flurry of activity. Reaction to the Gulf war has spawned  new groups and boosted participation in established ones.  "There are considerably more  people letting us know they are  coming for the first time," says  Seanna Queressette of End the  Arms Race. Queressette was hired  for a newly created staff position  the day war began in the Gulf.  "We've had people call up and  say 'I've voted Conservative all my  Ufe—but I just can't beheye this is  happening.'  "On the other hand, some people feel this war is somehow just,"  she says. PubUc opinion shifts  with events. The bombing in mid-  February of an air raid shelter  in Baghdad that left hundreds of  civilians dead prompted calls to  EAR. So did the gigantic oil spiU  in the Gulf.  The Gulf war has stirred activism among hundreds of BC high  school and college students. "We  never thought in this day and age  we would have such a war," says  Mikela Smith, one of the organizers behind a massive January  walkout by high school students.  Smith says some students fear this  is the beginning of the end of the  world. A newly formed BC Students Against the Gulf War seeks  to channel some of this fear into  activism.  A major new anti-war group,  the Middle East Peace Action  Coalition, hopes to be an alternative to established peace networks. MEPAC's first public meeting was so weU attended that not  everyone could fit into the rented  Organizers emphasize  gender parity  at public events  and want to ensure  that Arab-Canadian  voices are heard.  hall. They see their role as tackling the underlying causes of this  war through education and actions  aimed at unraveUing racism.  "We're concerned about how  httle information is getting out,"  says Roxanne Cave, OXFAM's  representative to MEPAC. "It's all  censorship and propaganda."  The coaUtion has organized a  series of educational evenings to  provide background on the Gulf  war. Organizers emphasize gender  parity at public events, and want  to ensure that Arab-Canadian  voices are heard. One of their major aims is to see an international  peace conference on the Middle  East.  Women are also coming together in a Women's Peace Circle, a group that is part support,  part action. "We're very new, but  determined," says Sue Cameron, a  member of the circle.  Carolyn Chne of the Women's  International League for Peace  and Freedom (WILF) reports that  membership is up. "Eight years  ago we were down to five or six  members," she says, "but we're  growing again." WILF began in  1915 during World War I, when  women from all over gathered in  the Hague—many over the opposition of their men, who were  busy fighting each other. There are  branches around the world, including in Israel and Palestine.  Chne beUeves women have a  special role to play in stabiUz-  ing the world situation. She describes WILF as action oriented.  Members stage a sUent vigU every Wednesday at noon at Robson Square to protest the Gulf war.  They plan to continue for the duration of the war.  Students, mainly teenagers, are  maintaining a peace camp on the  lawn of City HaU in Vancouver.  They too are prepared to protest  for the war's duration. The camp,  which was forced off city property  at the Art GaUery by an injunction, is an incongruous sight beside  the stern architecture of City HaU  and the ceaseless traffic of Cambie Street. A sign out front reads  "honk if you support peace." The  campers get honks, but they also  get verbal abuse—taunts thrown  out the windows of passing cars.  The most common insults are 'go  home' or 'get a job.' The irony is  that almost everyone at the camp  is working or going to school during the day.  Organization is loose and participants meet in the evening to  discuss the issues of the day.  There is httle rhetoric here, and  no compUcated explanations. The  campers simply beUeve their pres-  - ence can make a difference. "I'm  here because I beUeve in it," says  Mary Yates of Victoria.  The group hopes to force city  councU to take a stand on Canadian withdrawal from the Gulf,  and they note the hypocrisy of  Mayor Gordon CampbeU who attends the peace walk every year,  but won't protest an actual war.  Muriel Sibley of Victoria beUeves strongly in the value of  symboUc action. Sibley, a Quaker  whose participation in an international anti-war peace camp  on the Iraqi/Saudi border gained  widespread media attention, returned to Canada in February.  Seventy-three people from fifteen  countries gathered in the camp  to serve as a counterpoint to  the armies facing each other.  When the American attack began,  bomber planes flew right over the  camp. "The noise was so enormous," Sibley says, "it was a waU  of sound—I was shaking aU over."  The camp was eventuaUy evacuated by the Iraqis and participants  were bussed to Baghdad.  Sibley says Baghdad is a locked  and shuttered city. Anyone who  could, got out—but the streets are  stiU full of poor people.  "They thanked us for coming.  They say the people don't want  war, only governments want war.  But stiU, they are proud of Saddam Hussein for standing up to the  West."  Sibley beheves it is not too late  to get Canada out of the war. She  says every citizen has a respon-  sibility to do what they can for  world peace: "Sometimes you have  to take risks for peace."

If the NDP wins, the access  issue should be resolved, says  Thomas, noting that federal NDP  pohcy states that abortion is a private matter between a woman and  her doctor and that there should  be no law on abortion. While there  have been discrepancies at the  provincial level (the former NDP  government in Manitoba, for example, was criticized for its inaction around the laying of charges  against the Morgentaler chnic in  Winnipeg, and the Saskatchewan  NDP recently came out against  free-standing chnics) Thomas says  the party in BC is committed to  full funding for cUnics.  "They could not renege on  that," Thomas says. "The women's  committee of the NDP simply  would not stand for it."  NDP MLA Darlene Marzari is  a strong advocate for provinciaUy-  supported community health chnics and has slammed the Social  Credit government for its refusal  to fund the Everywoman's Health  Centre. "Instead of forcing women  to use American abortion cUnics,"  says Marzari, "the Socreds have  an obligation to expand access to  health services."  How the Socreds wUl react to  C-43's defeat is not yet known.  In an interview with Kinesis,  Carol Gran, minister responsible  for women's programs, says she  is waiting for recommendations  from the BC Royal Commission  on Health Care, which she says  wUl deal with a variety of access  issues, including the question of  free-standing cUnics.  WhUe Gran says she agrees  that abortion rights are critical  to women's equaUty, she also says  that she has avoided the issue.  "The issue of abortion is one  that I have tried to avoid because it's so controversial and I  have wanted so much to deal  with other issues." For Gran, more  pressing are chUd care, violence  against women, job opportunities  for women and women's poverty.  "Those are the issues that I've chosen to do something about," says  Gran. "I've said I don't want to  mire myself down in an issue I  can't do much about anyway and  abortion happens to be one of  those issues."  Anti-choicers say they wUl also  make abortion an election issue,  with strategies that include trying  to oust pro-choice poUticians Uke  Marzari and Black.  Both Thomas and Thompson  say they don't have a hope, noting that BC and indeed, Canada  as a whole, is strongly pro-choice.  "They tried it with Svend Robinson and Margaret MitcheU and aU  they did was increase their majorities," says Thomas.  Any increase in harassment of  women or doctors wUl also be  frowned upon by the public and  the courts, they say. Says Thompson: "They wiU attempt to re-  mobiUze around threats to sue  doctors for malpractice and a few  more court skirmishes on injunctions. But they wUl be minor and  very expediently dealt with by the  courts."  Adds Black: "We're winning the  fight for public opinion....Women  have proved, even though they  didn't need to, to anyone who had  a doubt, that they are people of integrity who can be trusted to make  their own decisions about their  own fertiUty and rights around reproductive issues."  KINESIS News  //////yy///yyy/y///yy/yyy/yy/yyyyy^  Welfare rights:  Challenging one of  BC's dubious distinctions  by Jean Swanson  "Women on welfare pirated the airwaves," said End Legislated Poverty organizer Pam Fleming after reflecting on the  "FuU Hearts and Empty Stomachs" Sanctuary held by ELP in mid- February. Fleming was happy because for once women on  welfare got some air time and ink as fighters, rather than as victims.  The women and ELP are fighting to get  the BC government to change a welfare regulation that requires single parents to seek  work or training when their youngest chUd  reaches six months. BC has the dubious  distinction of being the worst province in  the country when it comes to forcing single parents on welfare into the low wage job  market. Last December Alberta changed its  "four months old" regulation to give the babies two years at home with their mothers.  During the Sanctuary, 12 single moms  on welfare and their chUdren crowded into  the Four Sisters Co-op Daycare room for a  news conference, after spending the previous evening eating together and discussing  how to deal with the media and poUticians.  Debbie EUison, a mother with four chUdren, described how she had been on welfare  for six years and was now employed, but stiU  below the poverty Une. ElUson said the ministry's forced employment regulation does  not make single parents less dependent on  the system, because top-ups from welfare  are usuaUy needed to bolster low wages.  Maureen Ahearn, mother of three, noted  that kids usually get sick for several days a  month and mothers have to stay home with  CRTC  Stay tuned: more sexism to come  by Gertrude Anderson  In Canada, between 1984 and 1988, the  number of women characters in both French  and Enghsh adult TV drama programs decreased by two percent. On EngUsh radio  news programming, women were actually  mentioned three percent less in 1988 than  they were in 1984. In radio ads, the number  of women characters dropped 14 percent in  this four year period.  These statistics are from a study released  in December 1990 by the Canadian Radio-  Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the regulatory body responsible for licensing Canadian broadcasters. "The Portrayal of Gender in Canadian  Broadcasting" (the Erin study) compares  data from a 1984 study on aU aspects of radio and television broadcasting, with data  collected during the fall of 1988.  The 1990 summary of this research notes  that: "In virtuaUy every area of programming and advertising, more men- than  women appear on air. Almost without exception, the difference in the numbers of  women and men is attributable to people of middle age, between the ages of  36 and 65 (emphasis in original)." Once  women in broadcasting reach "middle age"  they become outnumbered by men by about  five to one. And in TV dramas, when women  were portrayed, they continued to be relegated to "traditionally female roles such as  home and family activities."  In 1982, a CRTC task force on sex-role  stereotyping concluded that the portrayal  of women in the broadcasting media was  in need of substantial improvements. As a  result, the industry engaged in a two year  period of self-regulation—it was left up to  broadcasters to monitor themselves and undertake their own initiatives to improve the  situation. By 1986, the CRTC concluded  that inadequate changes were made during this period, and therefore implemented  a condition of Ucense requiring broadcasters to adhere to sex-role stereotyping guide-  Unes.  The Erin study on gender portrayal includes the two years of self-regulation and  two of regulation by the CRTC.  Currently, the CRTC primarily rehes on  complaints from the public to inform it of  offensive broadcasting. While pubUc complaints effectively highlight instances of sexist broadcasting, they do not, according  to the CRTC's Sjef Frenken, provide the  overaU analysis which would be needed in  order to consider revoking a Ucense. Although Frenken admits that monitoring by  the CRTC would provide the kind of evidence needed for such an analysis, he points  out that funding cutbacks to the CRTC  mean that "we can not have monitors to  cover 750 broadcasting outlets...so we rely  on the public to a great extent." He added,  "I am a Uttle bit amazed at how Uttle agitation there is at the moment."  been lobbying hard for a return to self-  regulation, and the CRTC has made certain  aUowances to that effect, so we really encourage women to write now and teU the  CRTC it has to get more involved, not  Less involvement appears to be in the  works. In September 1988, the CRTC approved the establishment of the Canadian  Broadcast Standards CouncU. Once this  CouncU meets a few conditions outUned by  the CRTC—which wUl Ukely occur in a  year's time—member broadcasters may apply to the CRTC to have the sex-role stereotyping condition of Ucense removed in exchange for undertaking to regulate themselves. Before doing so, the CRTC wUl also  consider the past record of the broadcaster,  established in part by the number and na-  "...few of us  have time to  write every time we  see something sexist.'  With the release of the Erin study, the  CRTC has called for public comments by  March 15th "as part of its review of current  practices and pohcies on sex-role stereotyping." MediaWatch, an organization which  lobbies the CRTC to improve the image  of women in broadcasting, is preparing a  response. "We disagree with the onus the  CRTC places on the public complaint as  few of us have the time to write every  time we see something sexist," said Medi-  aWatch's Communications Officer, Jennifer  Elhs. "However, the broadcast industry has  ture of public complaints on file against the  station.  The Broadcast Standards CouncU, fashioned on a Press CouncU model, relies on  a multi-tiered pubUc complaint process to  keep its members accountable. "With the  CouncU, the emphasis is again placed on the  public to keep broadcasters in hne, and their  complaint-handUng mechanism would Ukely  discourage even the most perseverant complainant," said ElUs.

Monica Rosenberg  pointed out that even marriages where people have every expectation of success often  faU, and chUdren and families are left dependent on welfare.  Theresa Tresidder, mother of three and  a plaintiff in a court case chaUenging the  ministry to end the regulation forcing employment, said simply, "I already work full-  time raising three children. The government  shouldn't force me to have two fuU -time  jobs."  For ELP, the Sanctuary was one step in  getting more low income women involved in  fighting for their rights. At present, a single  mother with two chUdren and no chUdcare  costs would have to make $12.44 an hour just  to reach the poverty Une.  With a dismal chUdcare, job and wage situation in the province, the Social Credit's  desire to get single parents into the workforce cannot be seen as helping them escape  poverty. "They only exchange poverty on  welfare for poverty working, and kids are deprived of the time a mother can spend with  them," said Fleming. "H a parent chooses  to take a job, that is fine. We think that  should be the parent's choice."  The Sanctuary was only one part of  ELP's campaign to give women on welfare  choice regarding employment outside the  home. The campaign began when ELP set  up an action group of affected women at  the Unitarian Church last year. The Action  Group brought their issue to the media and  asked for a meeting with Norm Jacobsen,  the Minister of Social Services and Housing.  They also gained support from Vancouver  City CouncU after telling their stories last  October at a CouncU meeting.  Tresidder's court case won't be heard  untU March of 1992. MeanwhUe, ELP has  asked aU the cities and towns in BC to pass  resolutions in support of ending forced employment. Fourteen have.  At the Sanctuary, Joan SmaUwood, NDP  critic for MSSH, promised that the NDP  would end the forced employment regulation if elected. Although invited, Socred and  civic Non Partisan Association poUticians  did not show up. Said SmaUwood, "This  government only values famiUes if they are  upper or middle income."  To help ELP end forced employment for  single parents on welfare:  • Send a donation to help cover expenses  of ELP's next forced employment event;  • Write to Premier Vander Zalm and  NDP leader Michael Harcourt (send copies  to ELP) urging them to support an end to  forced employment;  • Send letters of support (care of ELP)  to the women fighting this. When they "go  public" they often have to endure disgusting phone calls and letters;  • Get groups that you belong to pass resolutions calling for an end to forced employment and pass them on to Vander Zalm,  Harcourt and ELP.

Too long has  this been going on.  by Agnes Huang  In March 1986, then Justice Minister  John Crosbie promised that the government  would "take whatever measures necessary  to prohibit discrimination based on sexual  orientation in aU areas of federal jurisdiction."  Five years later, lesbians, gay men and bisexuals stiU have no legal recourse against  discrimination under the federal Canadian  Human Rights Act (CHRA).  Recently, lesbian and gay rights activists,  with support from NDP Justice critic MP  Svend Robinson, launched a campaign to  force the government to make good on its  promises to amend the act to include sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds of  discrimination.  Activists charge that the Tories are dragging their feet about improving human  rights legislation in general in order to  avoid the contentious issue of sexual orientation rights in particular. For example,  the government has been urged to amend  the CHRA in order to better protect people  with disabihties from discrimination. Justice Minister Kim CampbeU was expected  to introduce amendments to the act last  fall and again this spring, yet ministry  spokesperson Richard Clair was unable to  say when the amendments are due.  Owen Lippert, CampbeU's press assistant, acknowledged that amendments were  not in the near future, but that "there is a  great deal of interest in the issue [sexual orientation] in the ministry right now, " said  Lippert, "and the minister is looking into it  herself."  WhUe the federal government has stated  that the equahty section (S.15) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should be interpreted as including sexual orientation, even  though it is not expUcitly stated, critics are  quick to point out that Charter protection  isn't sufficient to protect people from the  actions of homophobic employers, for example.  The CHRA, on the other hand, does provide human rights protection to employees,  but only those working in sectors under federal jurisdiction such as banking, communication and transportation. (To fuUy protect lesbians and gay men, provincial human rights acts would also need amending;  to date, only Quebec, the Yukon and Ontario cover sexual orientation.)  Robin ElUot, a constitutional law professor at UBC, further notes that there have  not been enough test cases to show that the  Charter would, in fact, protect lesbians and  gays.  Groups such as REAL Women are  strongly opposed to human rights protection for lesbians and gay men and have  made their position weU known to the Conservatives.  Uprising and  arrests at P4W  by Lizard Jones  Twenty-one women have been charged  in connection with riots at the Prison for  Women (P4W) in early February.  The women rioted in response to a suicide at the prison. Lorna Jones was found  hanging in her cell on February 4. She was a  twenty-three year old woman from Dawson  Creek, BC serving a two year sentence. She  was the fourth Native women to kUl herself  at P4W in the past 18 months.

The prisoners refused to return to their cells  after the incident, and instead armed themselves with pieces of wood and shower curtain rods. They put up barricades of beds  and furniture and threw pails of water at  the guards.  In response, the guards sprayed tear gas  at them to end the uprising. Eleven women  were immediately put in solitary confinement.  The recent riots come after a year of increasing tensions at the prison. Rioting occurred around January 1990, and again last  faU. These events once again raise questions  of conditions for women prisoners.  P4W, in Kingston, Ontario, is the only  federal prison for women in Canada. Physical conditions in the over 100 year-old buUding are widely recognized as terrible. Because it is the only penitentiary for women,  prisoners doing federal time are forced to  serve their sentences far away from their  personal support systems. They often wUl  have no visitors and are cut off from the  community, family and friends who are expected to help them when they get out.  Prison rights activists report that Native  women at P4W have been turning to local  Native communities for spiritual and cultural support, although this is not always  encouraged by the prison.  Numerous reports from grass roots and  government groups have finally led to a de  cision to close the prison and replace it with  regional jaUs. P4W's actual closing date is  stiU unknown, and there are reports tha;  the prison's administration is refusing to ad  dress current problems, citing plans for new  institutions as their excuse for inaction.

We, too, have  a golf course and airport built over  our sacred ancestral gravesites. Logging companies, operating under illegal  licenses issued by the provincial government that has no jurisdiction over  our land, have blown up our sacred  gravesites by building roads to steal our  valuable timber resource."  These words, contained in a Lil'wat Nation press statement from last year, attest  to the longstanding grievances of the Mt.  Currie band near Pemberton, BC. On July  12, 1990, the day after the first gunfire  against the Mohawk blockade at Kanesatake (Oka), the Lil'wat closed the road be  tween Pemberton and LiUooett. The road  passed through Lil'wat territories, and the  Lil'wat Peoples' Movement reiterated that  they had never signed a treaty with Canada  and had never ceded their land to the  province. The roadblock was maintained for  four months untU the province petitioned  the court for an injunction and enforcement  order to remove the blockaders.  On Nov. 6, 1990, the RCMP invaded  and dragged away 63 First Nations people,  charging them with criminal contempt for  ignoring the Supreme Court order. Because  no treaty has been signed, the Lil'wat are  considered internationally protected persons under international law. Based on their  interpretation of the 1763 Royal Proclamation, the Lil'wat Nation is a sovereign nation  and therefore the courts and poUce have no  jurisdiction over them. Refusing to surren  der to a foreign nation's authority, 49 Native  people declared themselves prisoners-of-war  and spent almost a month behind bars without bail for refusal to give their colonized  names or sign a pledge to not reopen the  blockade.  "We are teaching our own people the  truth about the system," explains Terri  John, spokeswoman for the Lil'wat Peoples'  Movement. "That it is Ulegal, it is foreign,  and it isn't our system. We can't raise our  chUdren in a system that is not ours."  In the forum of the courtroom, they won  another battle—the right to proceed with  a defense case based on the sovereign nation argument. As Kinesis goes to press,  the case is stiU being heard and the LU'wat  people's expectations of the results remain  realistic. John says, "We are dealing with  frustrated people that have been Uving in  Mary Ann Dan (pictured left,)  is shown at a support  rally for the Lil'wat  Peoples' Movement  held February in  Vancouver.

Retirement ruling:  Narrowing the Charter's scope?  by Birgit Schinke  The Supreme Court of Canada's recent  ruUng that the practice of mandatory retirement is constitutional under the Charter of  Rights and Freedoms may have profound—  and negative —impUcations for disadvantaged people in Canada.  The December ruhng concerned three  separate cases involving college instructors  and doctors who objected to their employers' pohcies of mandatory retirment at  age sixty-five. The Supreme Court determined that, whUe mandatory retirement  was indeed discrimination on the basis of  age, the discrimination was justifiable under the Charter's "free and democratic society" clause.  The Court's reasoning was both long  and complicated, involving the competing  needs of various sectors of society (employers and employees, for example). While  many observers were disappointed in the  ageist stance of the Court, others were even  more alarmed at what the ruhng could signify about the Court's approach to discrimination within the private sector.  Human rights advocates see the danger  as foUows:  The equahty provisions of the Charter,  which explicitly prohibit discrimination on  the basis of sex, race, colour, ethnic origin,  age, rehgion and disabihty, were intended to  protect social groups that governments were  often reluctant to help. Any group that felt  discriminated against should be able to use  the Charter to redress abuses.  With the mandatory retirement decision,  the court appears to have ruled that they  wUl defer to the government, that they wUl  not necessarUy require the government to  step in and put an end to discriminatory  practices between groups in society which  have competing interests.  Deferring to government essentiaUy  means non-intervention, because historically the government's role (except in criminal  matters) has been to stay out of the affairs  of private groups of people. In the case of  mandatory retirement, older workers cannot now assume that governments wiU protect them from employers' age discrimination.  If this logic can be appUed to "age" in  the Charter's equahty section, it can also be  appUed to the other grounds, such as sex.  Shelagh Day, a feminist and human rights  activist, says that the ruhng has "narrowed  the appUcation of the Charter and could be  very detrimental to women."  Day points out that when a social group  is disadvantaged (women, for example),  government intervention is vital in maintaining the balance of power which is constantly threatened by the sexism of our social structures. That is why women lobbied  for equahty rights in the first place. Day  adds that if this Supreme Court decision  "can be contained to the mandatory retirement issue, then it won't be generaUy damaging."  An upcoming Charter chaUenge involving Audrey Cope wUl provide a further clue  to what the Court's intentions are regarding  discrimination in the private sphere. Cope  is claiming that her rights under the Charter were contravened because she was denied housing on the basis of the age of her  chUdren.  The notion that the Charter has no impact in the private sphere can also effect disadvantaged social groups who are serviced  by private companies, a growing concern in  this era of increased privatization of government services. If a disadvantaged group has  no recourse under the Charter, where wiU  they find social justice?  a colonized system too long and the colonized system has been making them confused. We are trying to start a decolonization process."  With the matter before the courts, International Forest Products and their subcontractor Howe Sound Timber have moved  quickly in case the court grants the LU'wat  Nation jurisdiction of their lands. Road  buUding continued after New Year along the  south-west side of LiUooett Lake, at A7xa7  (pronounced A 'huh 'ah), the place where  the LU'wat beUeve their ancestors welcome  new souls into the realm of the spirit world.  Three ldlometers of a thirteen ldlometre  road have been completed and an ancient  pictograph site has been unearthed, already  damaged by equipment. Seven burial sites  are located along the hillside and culturaUy  modified trees have been identified, giving  proof to the ancestral use of that area. Although archaeologists and anthropologists  have been caUed in, the industrial desecration was not halted untU the LU'wat Peoples' Movement mounted another blockade,  in January 1991, of the road construction  along the Ure Creek drainage basin.  Interfor was granted a court injunction  against this blockade in early February. The  foUowing week saw numerous incursions by  the pohce, who were held off for a whUe  by LU'wat people defending their land with  rocks and raised voices. On February 9,  the RCMP staged a pre-dawn raid on the  makeshift camp and arrested nine men and  two women. Those arrested allege poUce  brutality left them with ripped clothes and  injuries from beatings. Eleven First Nations  people were held in custody without bail on  charges of obstruction and contempt.  Out of the centre of the cyclone  emerged a women's gathering of the LU'wat  Nation. Elaine James, one of the coordinators for the women at Mt. Currie explains: "The women's circle started meeting  whUe the first blockade was stiU on, in the  summer. If the women have things bothering them, we talk around the fire. We keep  each others' spirits up. H someone is trying  to quit drinking and they say they need support because they feel weak, then we meet.  We burn tobacco on our sacred fire and  offer prayers. Especially when we sing the  women's warrior song, it seems to make the  women really strong. It comes out so loud  and clear."  Outlining some of the practical plans for  the upcoming months, James said: "We  want to be self-sufficient. In the spring,  some of us are going to have a garden. We  want to farm so that if anything happens,  we would have our gardens and our meat.  We want to get the kitchen going so we can  have a bakery. H someone needs bread, they  can trade for something else. It would be  hke a co-operative.  "They say there are no gravesites over  there. What they are saying is just Uke slapping our elders in the face. My grandfather,  Charlie Mack, just died last year. He was 89  years old and used to talk about the smaU-  pox and the people that were buried over  there by the lake. His grandmother told him  aU those stories."

KINESIS International  Mexican women:  Paying the "Free" Trade price  by Deborah Bourque  Now that the Canadian government has  been given a "place at the table" in  the US-Mexico tree trade talks, Canadians wiU be hearing more and more about  the "maquiladoras." MaquUadora is an old  Spanish term used to describe the share of  grain a miUer would keep as a fee for grinding a farmer's wheat or corn.  Today, the term means different things to  different people. To American corporations,  the term refers to "free trade zones" along  the Mexican-USA border where these corporations can set up factories to assemble  goods for North American markets with low  labour costs and minimal export duties.  Canadian and other foreign multinationals find other attractions as weU, including the opportunity to circumvent US trade  sanctions, access to the US market, minimal  regulations with respect to labour codes,  employment standards," occupational health  and safety and poUution standards and controls.  To Mexican workers, rriaquUadoras mean  average wages of $3 per day in unsafe,  intolerable working conditions. For Canadian workers, the maquiladoras are places  where Canadian companies are threatening to move their factories or have already  moved their factories to avoid paying decent  unionized wages.  Today, there are over 1,800 factories   along   the   Mexican   border  in   the  maquiladora zones. Over half a miUion Mexican workers, primarily young, unmarried  women, Uve and work in the maquiladoras.  Life is harsh for maquila workers. Wages  are appaUingly low, hours are long, working  conditions are deplorable and communities  lack decent housing, sewage systems, water  and roads.  Entire families, including chUdren, must  work to simply survive because salaries have  plummeted drastically in the last decade  and weekly earnings meet only one-third of  a worker's basic needs. But women workers  face even harsher reaUties than their male  co-workers.  Women comprise 68 percent of the entire  maquiladora workforce. Except in heavier  industry, employers prefer to hire women,  the younger the better. Employers claim  that this is so because "women work with  more dexterity, adapt easier to repetitive  work and are more punctual."  However, the reaUty is that employers  know that women are very often reluctant  to do anything, such as union organizing, to  risk losing their jobs when they have chUdren to support. In Mexico there is no unemployment insurance, so if you are laid off,  you UteraUy lose the right to hve.  The burnout rate in the maquiladoras is  such that workers often last only 5 to 10  years, only to be replaced by younger workers. The legal working age is 16 but employers and unions routinely turn a bhnkered  Women's Day  greetings from  B.C.'s largest union  for working women.  Fighting for  pay equity.  THE HOSPITAL  EMPLOYEES' UHION  eye to this legal requirement. In fact, about  10 percent of the workforce is under age.  Women in the maquUa plants face serious  sexual harassment on the job and are subject to discipline and discharge for resisting managers' sexual advances. MaquUa employers have been known to host what are  referred to as "Friday night rape parties" for  supervisors involving female workers. Rapes  are also frequently reported when women  must travel late at night from their jobs.  Women routinely face dismissal on becoming pregnant. In some factories women  are required to show proof to staff doctors that they are menstruating. And despite legislation which provides that a pregnant woman wUl be moved to other work  if her health or the health of the fetus  is endangered, pregnant women continue  to work, unprotected from toxic chemicals. This chemical exposure often results in  birth defects.  Women in the public sector in the  maquUadora zones do not fare much better than their sisters who work in the factories. Since the growth of the maquUa industry the pubUc sector wages have plummeted because of the erosion of the tax base.  Teachers, for example, now earn about one  third of what they earned 10 years ago and  must combine other work with their teaching to earn enough money to Uve. It is not  unusual for schools to be transformed into  informal pubUc markets on the weekends  where teachers wiU seU produce, cosmetics  and crafts to the parents of their students.  These are only some examples of the type  of day-to-day hardships faced by Mexican  workers, in particular, women workers. Yet  this is the standard of Uving being imposed  on these workers by the American and Mexican governments in the interest of profits  for large US corporations. This is also the  way of Ufe that the Canadian government is  supporting by insisting on being involved in  the Mexico-US negotiations.  For Canadian and Mexican workers alike,  a continental free trade agreement wUl undermine the basic social and economic needs  of workers.

NURSES' UNION  wish all women a happy  International Women's Day  1991  KINESIS INTERNATIONAL  The former East Germany:  One Wall down,  many walls to go  by Heidi Walsh  There was gender equahty and 92 percent of women were integrated in the workforce. Violence against women didn't exist  and women were so content, there was no  need for a feminist movement.  Listen to the benefits for women:  A one-year paid pregnancy leave and the  right to go back to your old job. One day  off a month to tend to your household, and  the right to leave work early to pick up  your chUdren from the state-funded daycares. And up to 6 weeks leave annually to  stay at home with sick chUdren.  Nirvana?  No, this was East Germany under socialism, according to the government rhetoric.  But don't be completely fooled by the official picture.  Gender equahty was something of a riddle in East Germany. Women had it, but  then again they didn't. As part of a marx-  ist program to emancipate women, equahty  was written into the constitution when the  nation was formed. By the early 1970's, the  state announced that gender discrimination  had been ehminated. Women had equal access to aU education and training programs,  and thanks to the extra benefits granted by  the state, almost aU of them worked outside  of the home.  There is no doubt that East German  women generally enjoyed a high level of confidence because of their constitutional right  to work and their resulting financial independence. Discrimination in the workplace,  however, was pervasive.  Beate Locher, a former journalist Uving  in Leipzig, says that most women were ghettoized in the service and social sectors. Although women had the same educational  opportunities as men, they weren't landing  the same high-paying jobs, earning only 66-  75 percent of a man's salary. Women were  noticeably absent at the highest levels of  poUtics, economics and science.  Women who felt something was askew  were unclear of the causes, says Locher.  "The message from the government was:  'You are better off than women in other  countries. The state has given you so much,  you should be grateful.' Many women internalized this message and felt guUty if they  criticized the government."  The employment benefits, whUe designed  to help women combine motherhood and a  career, often worked against them. Employers were reluctant to hire women for responsible positions, afraid that women with famUy commitments would be "less reUable"  than male workers.  The benefits served a threefold purpose: they promoted chUdbirth, encouraged  women to join a labour-intensive workforce,  and thereby also gave women financial independence. But the benefits were avaUable  only to women and that was their greatest weakness. Feminists referred to them  as part of the government's "Mummy Pohtics."  The state had a very limited understanding of women's hberation, says Christine  Schenk, a speaker for the Unabhangiger  Frauenverband (Independent Women's Association) in East Beriin. "The state  thought if women were integrated into  the workforce, they'd automatically achieve  equality." Financial independence is a prerequisite to emancipation, but it does not  de facto give women equahty if other patriarchal structures remain in place. "The  benefits themselves were a good idea," says  Schenk, "but they didn't go far enough.  They should have been available to men,  too."  Two Jobs, Instead of One  East German socialism sought to cushion  women's double burden rather than eUm-  inate it by encouraging men to share domestic work. Women's hberation, the joke  went, meant having two jobs instead of one.  In addition to working 40 hours a week,  women performed two-thirds of the housework, took care of the chUdren and were responsible for the exhaustive task of shopping. It is Uttle wonder that women were  often too busy or too tired to attend after-  hours business and poUtical meetings—the  kind that lead to job promotions.  Because the state had officially solved  gender inequaUty, the topic became a taboo  subject, leaving women Uttle opportunity  to discuss the problem. The women's movement had been usurped in the early 1950s  by a sociahst mass organization and, as in  most sociahst countries, its role was to bring  the government's message to the women and  not vice versa.  Many women beheved they had achieved  equahty, others blamed themselves if they  had difficulties combining their roles as  mothers and employees. Some women, however, formed smaU underground feminist  groups to discuss the issues faced by women:  not oidy job discrimination, but also wife  battery, chUd abuse and rape.  Heidi Malz, hired in 1990 by the city of  Weimar to report on the status of women's  equahty, joined one of these groups in the  mid-1980s. The 12 women operated under  the protection of the church, fearing they  would be accused of subversive activity if  they held meetings in their own homes.  The group focused on researching the  taboo subject of women and violence. "We  could find no government statistics on the  subject, and the press made no mention of  it," said Malz. Even after secret documents  were made public in 1990, it was found that  such statistics simply hadn't been gathered.  In 1986, the group conducted a survey  among female relatives, acquaintances and  friends. Any broad type of survey would  have been Ulegal without government consent. Over half of the 134 respondents attested to being victims of rape or attempted  rape. Seventeen percent had been victims of  chUd abuse. Says. Malz, "I feel the survey is  accurate in showing that one in two East  German women are confronted with male  violence."  Help for victims of violence was sparse.  Since violence against women did not officially exist, there were no women's shelters.  Battered wives were often forced to continue hving with their husbands because of  a chronic housing shortage.  The government severely restricted the  autonomous women's groups from sharing  East German women protesting in summer of 1990, "Women, don't let yourselves  be marginalized."  information with one another and with the  public. Notices for events could only be  advertised in church buUdings and church  newspapers. The groups informed each  other of their projects during occasional visits, but their contact was sporadic.  When the Berlin WaU came tumbUng  down in November 1989, East German feminists were able for the first time to openly  speak of the problems facing women. But  was anybody hstening? Within weeks it became clear that women's efforts to overthrow the Stalinist regime of Erich Honecker were not translating into fair representation in the new poUtical parties. The  general opinion was that everyone, not just  women, had suffered under socialism, and  now was the time for solidarity, not nitpicking.  Refusing to become mere reUcs of the revolution, as women so often become when  the men sit down to restructure a nation, 1,000 feminists joined to form the Unabhangiger Frauenverband (UVF) in December 1989. Membership soon sweUed to  over eight thousand.  OriginaUy established as an umbreUa  organization for individual feminists and  women's groups, the UFV also ran in the  national East German election in March  1990. With phenomenal energy, the UFV  campaigned for reproductive choice, equal  representation in economic and pohtical  spheres, the preservation of state-funded  daycare and a myriad of other issues. But  the majority of East Germans were intoxicated by the thought of achieving the West  German standard of Uving, and voted into  power a conservative party that promised  them just that. The UFV didn't win a single seat.  Despite the efforts of the new women's  movement, and echoes from West German  feminists urging East German women to  fight to retain their benefits and economic  independence, their message generaUy went  unheeded. There had been no tradition of  feminism in East Germany, no struggle to  win equal rights. The rights women enjoyed  had been handed to them by the state, and  they assumed the state, even a capitalist  one, would continue the practice.  The initial euphoria that fired the new  women's movement was soon doused by  grim reaUties. Both women and men were  suddenly confronted with unemployment,  but the consequences were more acute for  women. Those who lost their jobs also lost  access to the company-run daycares and  had to stay at home to look after their fam-  Uies. Many feminists found themselves having to devote aU their energy to just keeping their families afloat.  The past year has been a rude awakening for East German women. Although a  widespread feminist consciousness does not  yet exist, women are losing their complacency. Pornography, previously banned, has  hit East Germany with a vengeance. (In the  city of Erfurt, 30 video stores carrying hardcore videos opened in a six-week period.)  Violence against women has increased  unemployed men take out their frustrations  on their spouses. And although women's  shelters have since been established, many  women no longer have the financial independence to give them the confidence to leave  abusive relationships.  The East German women's movement,  stiU under the umbreUa of the UFV, has  not regained its initial dynamism, but it remains distinct from the West German movement even after reunification. Its current focus is to lobby for continued subsidized daycares beyond June 1991, after which time  the now unified German government is no  longer contractually bound to fund them.  Also high on the priority hst is the protection of women's access to abortion. The  women know they are in for a long struggle.

KINESIS -     S8§S88§§\  International  South Africa:  Laws may change  but apartheid remains  by Lizanne Foster  Apartheid is not dead.  The South African government's announcement in February that it intends to  scrap three of the notorious "cornerstones  of apartheid" is unUkely to significantly alter the overaU structure of the country's inhumane socio-political system.  The three acts which de Klerk's regime  has promised to rescind—the Group Areas  Act, the Land Acts and the Population Registration Act—provided the South African  state with the means to create a system of  social and economic divisions along the hnes  of skin colour and racial background.  Even if the acts are abolished, the structures of systemic racism wiU remain intact.  How Will This End Segregation?  The Group Areas Act of 1966: simply put,  if you were a South African Black woman,  you were restricted in your movements with  regard to where you could work and Uve.  You could not own an apartment in any  city or town—you could only "own" land  in your "homeland." If you were lucky to  obtain a permit to work in the cities, your  bigger problem was finding a place to hve.  The fact that this was an impossible task for  miUions of people explains the mushrooming of squatter settlements on the outskirts  of major cities. These settlements, the most  weU-known being Crossroads in the Cape  province, have no running water and no sanitation.  The abohshment of the Group Areas Act  wUl not change these facts. Opening up residential areas so that anyone can hve anywhere they choose wUl not solve the problem of homelessness created by apartheid.  People forced to Uve in these settlements  wUl be unable to afford the rent in a city  apartment because they stiU work for meager wages. Black people—Black women in.  particular—are stUl the lowest paid workers in the country. This economic aspect  of apartheid has not changed at all and  wUl continue to create poverty among Black  people.  The Group Areas Act, having forced people to Uve apart, also bears responsibU-  ity for inter-group conflicts and misunderstandings. The law was nothing more than  a means to "divide and rule," and the pain  and suffering that these divisions have engendered wUl not end with the scrapping of  the act.  No Mention of Land Re-Distribution  The Land Acts of 1913 and 1936 were  responsible for forcing 87 percent of the  population  (Black people)  onto  13  per-  Maureen McEvoy ba ma (Cand.)

Out of that 13 percent,  the apartheid regime created the so-called  homelands which the South African government now regards as separate countries.  Do you remember Sun City and the ban  on entertainers performing there? Sun City  is in the "independent homeland of Bo-  phutatswana."  The homelands idea was actuaUy mod-  eUed after the Canadian government's Indian reserve system. Black people were allocated to a homeland and were forced to  show a 'pass' when they entered the rest of  South Africa. The requirement for this pass  was abolished in 1989.  Because the "homelands" were created  on the most unsuitable farming land in the  country, they have become the scene of  genocide as thousands of people virtuaUy  starve to death because they cannot produce any crops torn the barren land. The  kinds of images that the world associates  with the famine in Ethiopia and the Sudan  could have come from any of the homelands  in South Africa, The famine wUl not end  when a piece of paper becomes part of history.  It is stiU unclear whether the scrapping  of the Land Acts wUl also lead to the scrapping of the "homelands." If it does not, then  aU we have is another cosmetic change. In  order for the enormous tragedy perpetuated  by the "homelands" pohcy to end, aU the  SOUTH AFRICAN WOMftfl  1      ..' :%llflMllllnf*V.l\  C   Er   ^.iXlltfllfr  These bodies have no real power.

The classification into the different categories determined the kind of Ufe a chUd  would lead since different groups were aUocated different resources and money by the  government. For example, the government  does not have an overaU education budget, but a different budget for each of its  10 educational departments (aU determined  racially).  In 1976 when the Soweto rebeUion occurred, the government had aUocated 41  rands for each Black chUd and 621 rands  for each White chUd. This meant that the  White schools could have tennis courts,  swimming pools, free textbooks and a  teacher-pupil ratio of 1:20 whUe the Black  schools were lucky if they had electricity in  •**l*VWNft»WMl*Wftri«PWNI  Economic apartheid continues to create  rich whites and poorer Blacks  I**********  m  land wUl have to be redistributed among aU  the people so that we do not have the situation where a single white farmer owns thousands of acres which he does not even cultivate, whUe Black farmers try to eke out a  hving on tiny patches of barren land.  And No Mention of Democracy  The Population Registration Act ensured  that people were placed in certain racial categories based on the actual colour of their  skin at birth. The categories were White,  Asian, Coloured and Black. The "coloured"  chUd was one that had "mixed" parents,  i.e., from two different racial groups. The  act made possible the formation of the tri-  cameral parUament which gave the Asian  and Coloured groups a vote for their parliament: the House of Delegates (Asian) and  the House of Representatives (Coloured).

The teacher-pupil ratio was, and stiU is, 1:54  in most Black schools but a ratio of 1:100 is  also common in some areas.  Although the government has increased  the money it spends on Black education, it  has not made much difference as it was far  too Uttle and far too late. In South Africa,  there are miUions of chUdren who have not  had a continuous school year for the past 14  years. If you consider that over 50 percent  of the Black population is under 20 years of  age, you wUl have some sense of the proportions of this tragedy.  Change in the education system is something that is imperative for any hope of real  economic changes in the country.

Universal suffrage was not mentioned at the announcement and that ultimately is what the  struggle is aU about—the right to vote and  to determine how one wiU be governed.  Over the past two years the South  African government has succeeded in creating an Ulusion of change in the country. The  scrapping of the Pass Laws and the Separate Amenities Act, the release of some pohtical prisoners and the hfting of the State  of Emergency may aU look Uke huge steps  towards the end of apartheid—but the journey has not even begun. The system has  invaded every aspect of hfe in the country  and has roots embedded deep in its economic foundations. Nothing has changed in  the day-to-day realities of people Uving under apartheid. None of the recent changes  have addressed the gross inequaUties in the  economy of the country.  The gap between the affluent (usually  white) and the poor (usually Black) is one of  the greatest in the world. Jobs continue to  be reserved for whites who earn up to three  times what a Black person would with the  same qualifications. The shortage of skiUed  labour is a direct result of an education policy that was designed to ensure that Blacks  would never be more than workers under  a white manager. This has not changed.  Economic apartheid continues to create rich  whites and poorer Blacks.  The South African government wUl have  to do much more than scrap social apartheid  laws. It wiU have to create new legislation  so that aU people in the country can share  in its wealth. The pohtical and economic aspects of apartheid must be dealt with in a  surgical manner so that we can be rid once  and for aU of this malevolent system.

For  Arabs, the news of the beginning of a deadly war in the Middle East was overwhelmingly  tragic. Perhaps my reaction as an Arab was shared by many. I cried—for our people, for  the innocent, for our Arab lands and civilization. The one thought that came to mind  was: "How can such a few, a mere minority, determine the hves of the majority and exterminate Uves of innocent humans in a great ugly game of poUtics?"  One cannot help but feel helpless and trapped in a world where choices do not truly  exist. As an Arab I feel helpless, for it seems Arabs have no choice in the matter of their  nations' destruction. Like any other Third World country which decides to rise as an independent power, Iraq is getting crushed by the superpowers. That is not to say that  Arabs do not reject and resent Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, which is recognized  as an aggressive crime. However, Arabs do resent the fact that the solution to such an offence does not he in their hands but, at the moment, in the hands of the Western aUies.  As a result, innocent Arab blood is being shed in great quantities aU over Iraq. The  Gulf war is often labeUed a righteous war, a war seeking justice. If justice were truly  a concern in this affair, negotiations would have been a possibihty. But talks, along  with other alternatives—such as proposals for an Arab solution—have been completely  blocked. The blocks started August 3rd when King Hussein of Jordan suggested an Arab  peace settlement (with Saddam Hussein's wUUngness to withdraw from Kuwait at the  time) and have continued up untU mid-February when the Iraqi proposal to withdraw  from Kuwait met with rejection by the Americans. It seems that aU Arab efforts for  peace are immediately crushed.  I also feel helpless, along with the many people aU around the world who protest  against the war in large demonstrations. However, no matter how strongly people voice  their rejection of the war, they are stiU pushed into it. Thousands have marched in the  streets of many cities and have said: "No!" Yet, with no public consent, the orders of  supposedly elected representatives prevaU. Private interests and thirst for control seem  to talk much louder than real human voices and cries.  The Gulf war is  often labelled  a righteous  war...If justice  were truly  a concern...  negotiations would  have been a  possibility.  It is important to note and remember the words of the US ambassador to Iraq on July  25th. As a response to Hussein's complaints about Kuwait's pohcy of economically undermining Iraq by overproducing oU, ambassador AprU Glaspie, echoing Washington's official poUcy, said that the US has "no opinion on Arab-Arab affairs." Why is it that US  reaction to the invasion of Kuwait grew to such large proportions that the "affair" finally  escalated to the deadly solution of war? The US excuse is that of protecting sovereignty  (by restoring the Kuwaiti royal family) and protecting international law.  However, the real causes of this war pohcy are more distant than these noble causes.  They are purely reasons of a larger pohtical game or gain. The presence of immense oU  suppUes in Kuwait and throughout the region is one reason for US concern. The second  important cause is that of regional control. The US seeks to remain in control of the region economically and poUticaUy, with Israel as a "policeman" in the Middle East. (This  explains the Americans' permanent support of Israel, and also explains Washington's  need to remove aU rising—and challenging—states that can disturb this "imbalance" of  power).  Finally, one should not ignore the continuing rise of two top economic powers, Japan  and the European Economic Community. As the world's greatest military power, the US  can control the threat of these two rising superpowers by reasserting American authority  over the Middle East's oU. The whole world is being forced to deal with a war that saves  US interests.  Arabs are dying for American interests—a fact that is completely overshadowed by the  media's presentation of the Gulf war. As an Arab-Canadian, I am absolutely enraged by  the North American "version" of this conflict. The media is behaving hke a propaganda  machine working for pohtical interests rather than the truth. This kind of coverage shields  the public from reality and enhances the allied governments' efforts to achieve their poUtical goals with needed domestic support. The media has once again succeeded in justifying and glamorizing the war: "The cause is great...the evil Saddam Hussein victimizing  the Princes of Kuwait."  Arab nations will  continue to be  puppets played  according to  the West's  economic and  political interests.  There have been repeated images of Hussein's use of chemical gas in the past, but no  mention of the Americans' use of deadly gas in Vietnam on the civiUan population. We  are faced with a media coverage full of hypocrisy, where the enemy has been successfuUy  satanized, and the AlUes "Saintized".  The media also smooths over the tragedies of war by not showing any aUied troops in  agony or pain, therefore projecting an image of an easy victory. Simplified images and vocabulary are constantly used to hide the complexities of this conflict: "game" terminology  where people are going to "kick ass." But this is not a game; the stakes are human Uves  and the sacrifices are beyond imagination. Thousands and thousands of Iraqi civUians have  died, with rare mention of the immense numbers of casualties. The latest coverage of such  atrocities was shown on February 13th when a shelter was bombed and hundreds of people  burned to death (another version of holocaust).  Immediately, the bombing was justified as part of Hussein's plans: guilt was shifted onto  the enemy. The media also keeps mentioning the poor treatment of aUied prisoners of war  by Iraq. On January 25th, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, Joe Clark, stated that  Iraq's treatment of POW's as human shields violates the Geneva conventions and was "uncivilized". What hypocrisy! How shameful! Is war at aU civUized? Do these international  laws justify the cause of war and the use of civUians as victims? How ironic—rules for protecting POWs who were sent with the risk of death in mind, whUe innocent people die  with no say in the matter. It seems the media gives more value to Western miUtary losses.  Is Arab blood not worth much?  One cannot help but see a very sombre picture of the future for the entire Arab region.  The US wUl remain in the region even after the end of the war, whenever that may be. The  Gulf wUl be annexed (unofficiaUy) by the US and its aUies. The war wUl result in destruction of cities and Uves. A new poUtical order (or chaos) wUl form in the region, with the  Arabs drawn back a hundred years in time, under colonial authority again. Arab nations  wUl continue to be puppets played according to the West's economic and pohtical interests. If one puppet happens to escape the show and become sovereign, a tremendous force  of 500,000 troops wUl once again be sent to re-attach the strings. So long to the so-called  democracy of the West, to humanity, to civilization, to Arab existence and pride. Welcome  to mass destruction, to humUiation, to unjust deaths, to imperialism at its best.

RAN:  REASONS  FOR  LEAVING  by Ladan, IMasrin and Manijeh  Both during and after the Iran-Iraq  war (1980-1988), many Iranians left  their country as refugees, fearing religious or political persecution—and fearing future wars.  Kim Irving interviewed three Iranian  women now living in Vancouver who,  for reasons of personal safety, choose  not to use their real names. The women  expressed great sympathy for the people of Iraq: "They haven't chosen war—  the governments have. The suffering,  the bombings, the relatives and children  dying—we know this and we feel sorry  for them."  "It was very painful to ask my daughter  to tell a lie, in order to save ourselves."  Ladan: I was having pohtical problems  in Iran. It came to a point where the government was looking for me—I didn't want  to leave but it was impossible to stay. I  left three years ago and spent a year and  a half in Turkey. The United Nations chose  Canada for me and my family. I would  have hked to have gone to a European  country—I think it's more pohticaUy active there. In Canada, there are more problems with language, the economy and immigration. And the immigration [process]  discriminates against Arab people—we're  Black.  Nasrin: My story is a bit different. I  wasn't pohticaUy active but I was against  the government. My husband was more pohtical. However, I was asked to spy for the  government at my job—I didn't want to,  so I quit. When my husband was in trouble we decided to leave. We chose to come  to Canada and arrived three years ago: my  husband, my daughter and myself.  I thought that women would have more  rights here than in Iran. However, under the  surface there's really not much difference. I  didn't realize there would also be a lot of  pressure on women here.  Manijeh: Four years ago we left Iran:  my husband, three chUdren and myself. We  hved in Pakistan for three years and came  to Canada 11 months ago. In Iran I had no  security—for work, for education, for pohtical thinking. I taught chUdren's school. I  was also very active in the university. Six  years ago the government fired me because  my ideas differed from theirs. No woman has  freedom of choice in Iran—neither religious,  economic nor poUtical freedom.  Nasrin: Last year I went back to Iran.  I hadn't been there for two years, since the  [Iran-Iraq] war. I noticed how sad everyone  looked, how depressed. I never saw a smU-  ing face on the street. Even kids, small chUdren were depressed. Young people seemed  so much older. They had white hair and  were depressed. It's the war. The economy  is destroyed. Everyone is having a terrible  time.  Ladan: Before the [1978] revolution in  Iran, the monarchy was in power for 32  years. During those 32 years, the Shah  did nothing for the people—there was only  poverty and injustice. Many people thought  that, after the revolution, there would be  many changes, but the rehgion took over.  The situation became worse. As my friends  said, women have no rights. Thousands of  people are in jaU for poUtical reasons.  Nasrin: It's hard to explain the oppression. Even if you don't do anything or talk—  it's just if you think in a way that the  government doesn't Uke ... When I start  thinking differently than the government, I  start to act differently—that may be enough  for my neighbour, or a guard to turn me  in. At schools the teachers ask the chUdren:  "Do your parents pray at home? ... What  do your parents do? ... What do your parents say about the leadership?" The chUdren don't understand, and the next day the  guards come and arrest the parents.  When my daughter went to school, I  asked her: "When the teacher asks if your  parents pray at home, what are you going  to say?" She said: "WeU, I'U say no, because  you don't." I said: "But some things are secrets. This is our secret." It was very painful  to ask my daughter to teU a Ue, in order to  save ourselves.  Manijeh: Many times soldiers came to  my home. My son, the youngest, would get  very angry and cry. One time they came to  take me to jaU. My mother was crying, my  father was crying, aU my famUy—my son  held me and cried. The first time I was arrested I was pregnant. They come to your  house only with papers from the Ministry  of Justice. They say they have questions for  you. They put a piece of cloth over my eyes  and they put me in the car and pushed my  head down to my knees ...  Some women take their chUdren to jaU.  They Uve in small rooms. You can never  see the day Ught. Everyday the women cry.  When you are in jaU, you always can hear  women being tortured.  Ladan: Women go to prison for many  reasons— for example, if they are caught  showing any paxt of their body or hair below their veU. Another area is drugs—there  are many women in prison for heroin addiction.  Nasrin: Prostitution—it's Ulegal. Homosexuality—no one talks about lesbianism  or homosexuahty in Iran. It's a forbidden  issue. Punishment is written in law so if a  woman has an affair with another man, she  must be stoned to death. If hair shows below her veU, she must be beaten. The degree of punishment depends on the reUgious  person who's ruhng.  When I recently visited Iran, many of  the left organizations that once existed were  no longer active. Even then, most left organizations were against feminism. They  thought feminism would make their movement weaker. Right now, the only organization for women is a religious one and the  last thing they'll talk about is feminism!  Ladan: When I was a Uttle girl, I often  wondered why my father was always ordering around my mother—why is he the boss?  I talked to my mother and she said it was no  problem, that "he's my husband." I went to  a co-ed elementary school and noticed the  teacher gave more attention to boys. When  my ideas started changing there were some  problems, but I talked to my mother and  she was supportive.  Manijeh: When I was three or four, I  knew that girls weren't hked—only boys.  When I saw husbands hitting wives and  they could never hit back—that was hard  for me. A friend's husband started hitting  her and I asked her, "Why don't you hit  him back?" But she was afraid her marriage  would break up and she would loose her chUdren. Every woman that I knew—in my own  family too—was never happy with their situation. They're not famihar with feminism.  Nasrin: I was the youngest chUd—the  oldest is my sister with two brothers in  between. My parents didn't beheve girls  needed to go to school. After my sister finished grade school, she was sent to cooking  school and then put in an arranged marriage  at eighteen. My two brothers were very free  but never did very weU in school. Since I was  such a good student, my father was more  supportive. I always knew that I didn't want  the same Ufe as my sister. I choose my husband; our marriage was at a notary public.  Many thousands of women lost their husbands, sons and fathers during the Iran-Iraq  war. Perhaps it was worse for the younger  women, losing their husbands and having no  income to survive. The government opened  marriage establishments for these women  to find husbands. And there were men returning from war—bhnd, hurt, disabled-  needing someone to take care of them. The  government matched them with widows.  Many men took advantage of this.  Ladan: The government also started—-  there's no Enghsh word for it—it's a religious term for a marriage for a Umited time.  Nasrin: Yes, a man can go up to a  woman and say this word and they are married, for one hour, one day, whatever. It's  legalized prostitution. The government said  it was a way to get rid of sexual pressure.  Ladan: During the war, because Iraq  invaded Iran, many Iraqi soldiers raped  women and sold women to other men. With  the Kurds [in northern Iraq] the Iranians  did the same thing— Iranian soldiers raped  the Kurds.  Manijeh: Our chUdren have known and  experienced bombs and the fears of war.  My chUdren hated war and they don't want  more. They are very sympathetic towards  the situation in Iraq.  Nasrin: Our daughter is 10 and she  hasn't forgotten her fears. One of our first  days in Canada was Canada Day. There  were fireworks—everybody around us was  enjoying them. But for us, we couldn't forget aU those frightening memories. Now,  watching the news of the coaUtion attacking  Iraq and talking about aU the fireworks—  this is the brainwashing. People are dying  over there and aU they talk about is the  beauty of their fireworks in the sky.  Ladan: My daughter is only three and a  half but she understands what's going on.  She sees Bush and Saddam on TV and says:  "Oh Mommy, bad George, bad Saddam."  She knows.  KINESIS Iraq:  Wars take their toll  by Janeen Aljadir  Janeen Aljadir is an Iraqi woman presently living and studying in Vancouver.  She and her immediate family left Iraq seven years ago when Janeen was sixteen.  She spoke with Kinesis' Nancy Pollak about Iraq: the position of women in that  country, and her perspective on the war.  Janeen began by talking about her concerns for her family in Iraq.  I haven't had any contact with my family since the war started— it's not possible. It's  almost better not to hear anything. At least now I can imagine that everything's okay  with them.  I have two aunts who I am very, very close to—in a sense they raised me. My parents  were out at work so they dropped me off every day at my grandmother's house. I was  the first chUd in the family and I was just spoUed to death by these two aunts who were  not married. We used to eat off the same plate, sleep in the same bed.  That's what hurts me the most. I've been so far away from them for so long and  there's nothing I can do to help them right now. They Uve in Mosul, north of Baghdad.  Mosul has been attacked—I saw some pictures awhUe ago on TV. One of the schools was  attacked, and also a Christian church. It was just a flash that I saw on TV.  On the status of women in Iraq:  Islam has a very strong influence on [the status of] women. The ideas of Islam are  what dictate what women should and shouldn't be. I would make Islam the reason behind women's backwardness, their position of being shoved back in the home. Not because Islam originaUy said women should be this or that, but because, over time, ideas  were mixed around.  When the Ottoman Empire took over [what is now Iraq, in the 15th century] women  were set back. When Mohammed originaUy preached Islam, women were side by side  with men [in the teachings]. They were equal—maybe not completely equal, but almost.  The Ottoman Empire introduced the abaya—the long black robe covering women—  which is stiU worn today. That's why women can't go out in short skirts, or wearing  sleeveless dresses, or wearing make-up—unless it's for their husbands. This is very strict  Islam: women have to cover their hair if there's a man other than their husband in the  house. It's very, very oppressive.  I wasn't very aware of feminism and such things when I was sixteen—it wasn't an issue for me. But I know there were feminist women in Iraq. A friend of my family was a  big feminist. She went to England to get her education and then returned to do her PhD  on women in Iraq. There were a lot of women hke that, although there was not a clear  movement.  There are aU sorts of restrictions on what women can do in public hfe, as far as appearance, social activities, everything. Before the Iran-Iraq war started [in 1980], Iraq  had been opening up a lot to the West. The government had [encouraged] the changes:  there was a lot of money in the country and Iraq was starting to use the money for its  own development instead of having it aU sucked out, going to the West. Women were  starting to leave the house more, going to social events—even though it was with the  family, as a family—but nevertheless having a public Ufe.  There were new ideas coming in and modernization in every aspect of Ufe. You could  see this in the people on the street—people started to dress differently, the way they  Uked, as opposed to the old fashioned way with the abaya.  The Iran-Iraq war put a big stop to that. The country went on hold, with everyone  wondering what would happen. Everyone thought that war would be over in three weeks  and we would come out victorious and everything would be fine. Iran and Iraq have had  problems throughout history—they've always been fighting. This war was just a continuation. Again, it's just about power, about two crazy men hungry for power. I reaUy  doubt that the waterway [in dispute] made that much of a difference to either country,  even though that's what they claimed.  The war lasted eight years and took it's toU on the country— financiaUy, emotionaUy.  No one was interested in anything else, and I would say it froze the country.  Birth control was avaUable before the war—you could walk in and get pills or whatever easily. But after the war started, I think birth control was taken off the market completely because they needed to increase the population because of aU the deaths.  I think about that a lot. I can imagine the streets of Iraq now being almost empty of  young men. I was talking to my father about this and he said, yes, there are no men on  the streets now any more.  There are a lot of very, very young widows. I remember women in my famUy being  married and widowed in the same month—twenty, twenty-one year old women, pregnant already. Some would be married off again quickly to their husband's older brother,  just to keep the kids in the famUy or as a charity act, not out of love or anything Uke  that. Men are aUowed more than one wife, so it's not a problem if the older brother is  already married. That's not so common anymore but it used to be: my grandfather had  two wives, my grandmother and my stepgrandmother.  Widows who are lucky and have a job already could support themselves. But if she  was very young when she married and without an education, I imagine she'd get some  kind of compensation from the government, but not really enough to raise a chUd. She'd  probably have to move back home with her parents and hve off them. This is very sad, .  very degrading. She just becomes a reject: "This is our widowed daughter and her kid,  and she's a burden on us."  Nobody actually says it, but that's society's attitude: "this is your burden daughter."  There's always hope of a man coming along wanting to marry her, but with the shortage  of men, she's lucky if anyone comes along. If someone three times her age asks to marry  her, the family wUl probably marry her off just for the financial security because her parents won't be there forever.  "There are a lot of  very, very young  widows."  On the war in the Gulf:  So many things go on in my head about the invasion of Kuwait. It's not Iraq as a  country's decision to walk into another country and take over. But on the other hand,  from what I hear in the media here, the army that actually invaded Kuwait was—weU,  there are the horror stories of the army raping people, slaughtering people. It makes me  think, what's my country really about? Maybe everything they say is true. I have very  mixed feehngs. One day I'm very proud to be Iraqi and to belong to that country, and  the next day I'm not.  There's a definite separation between the miUtary leadership of Iraq and the Iraqi people. But, at the same time, Saddam Hussein has so much support and I wonder why they  support him. Now, during the Iran-Iraq war, I could see why he was loved by the people. He gave gifts and presents and money to the people, and everybody feU in love with  him. But I don't think there is a family in Iraq that doesn't have a dead person from the  eight year war.  Part of the support for him is out of fear—because no one can speak their mind and  say, 'No, I'm not going out in the streets to show my support, to yeU and shout for the  president.'  The consequences of saying no would be very bad. My father says there are executions  going on daily in Iraq. Anyone who stands in the way is just wiped out, Uke that. When  I Uved in Iraq, there were times when you were afraid to state your opinion to an acquaintance because there were so many people who belonged to the Baath party [the ruling party] who weren't public about their membership. Some people were very proud to  be part of the Baath party and that was fine because then you knew where they stood.  But a lot weren't open, it was sort of a secret thing. And if you said the wrong thing to  the wrong person you were in big trouble. Pohtical opposition is non-existent—if it exists, it's very underground, very secret.  I think the Iraqi people have been led to beheve that, in general, the West is bad: they  want to come in, use the oU, use the country for their own good—and there's truth in  that ... That's why we have the war—because Iraq was becoming so powerful in many  senses. So it had to be stopped—there had to be a war.  There are a lot of unfair things being said in the media. I haven't encountered anything personaUy—people don't know I'm Iraqi—but generaUy there are a lot of misconceptions about Iraqis and Iraq. People shouldn't see what the Iraqi government is doing as a representation of the whole population. People are people, the same everywhere.  Iraqis are just trying to Uve in peace hke everyone else.  KINESIS British Columbia Teachers' Federation  2235 Burrard Street, Vancouver, RC V6J 3H9  731-8121 or toll free 1-800-663-9163.

Theytus Books will publish the second issue this fall. See Bulletin Board—Submissions.  For the past five hundred or so years,  the voices of Native women have been silenced by the onslaught of European immigration to Turtle Island. The immigrants  brought new governing structures and belief systems which they imposed on the land  and the nations of people living here, who  already had governing structures and belief systems honed over thousands of years.  The First Nations were matriarchal and cooperative while these new people were patriarchal and individualistic. These differences  continue to have an impact on all peoples  and nations living on this land today.  In order for the Europeans to obtain control over the First Nations peoples and their  land and her resources, they silenced what  was central to the perpetuation of the matriarchal and co-operative spirit and values  of First Nations: the voices of First Nations  women.  The catalysts that helped break the  silence for Native women were the far-  reaching and liberating forces of the women's movement and the influences of  Marx's analysis of class oppression. Other  catalysts that helped pave the way for Native women breaking silence were the American Indian Movement, the growth of Native  political and cultural organizations and the  environmental movement...  In the 1970s, Maria Campbell's autobiography Halfbreed, was published. This  marked the beginning of a movement.  Lee Maracle published her autobiography,  Bobbi Lee: Indian Rebel, at about the  same time but due to politics and market trends, her book did not reach the  wide audiences—Halfbreed did. (Bobbi  Lee has been recently re-issued and is available in major bookstores.) In 1983 Native  women writers got public attention at the  Women and Words conference in Vancouver. This conference marked a path towards  the history-making workshops and readings  hosted by Native women writers at the 1988  Third International Feminist Book Fair in  Montreal. Lee Maracle, Jeannette Armstrong, Paula Gunn Allen, Janet Campbell-  Hale, Chrystos, Joy Harjo, Lenore Keeshig-  Tobias, Midnight Sun, Beth Brant, Barbara Smith, Gloria Anzaldua and Marilou  Awaikta have all published within the past  three years.  Why Are You Being So Silent?  In silence there is no movement, no change:  good odds for victimization, powerlessness.  In breaking silence, there is movement,  change, transformation: creation and birth.  Breaking the silence for Native women is a  major step towards stopping the forces that  have been silencing us. However it must be  done on our own terms or the voice will not  be our own and will not truly empower us.  A white woman at the Telling It women  writers' conference (1988) asked: "Why are  some women silent?" The only women who  did not speak were the women of colour.  This woman said it was probably due to  the fact that these women were not used to  speaking. This is typical of what a woman  of colour puts up with, over and over again.  White people speak and make assumptions  about us right in front of our very faces and  ears as if we don't even exist or have a voice,  all the while taking up the space we could  be using for our voices.  Chrystos' poem "Maybe We Shouldn't  Meet If There Are No Third World Women  Here" (from Not Vanishing) expresses a  rhetorical question in response to this kind  of familiar experience: "How can we come  to your meetings if we are invisible." The  workshop's topic, "Living the great novel  versus writing one," did not seek the perspective of women of colour who know most  the meaning of living the great novel. It  is our silence that is addressed more often  than our voices. There is many a message  to be found in silence if one chooses to hear  them. Finally, at the end of the workshop,  out of the body of a brown woman a voice  rose. It was a voice of frustration, anger,  pain, sadness and it was our voice. Too often  the only voice white women actually hear  is the hurting or angry voice of women of  colour. It is sad this woman was forced into  her unvaliant and lonely position without a  functional structure of coloured support. Instead she fled from the room, and the topic  of the one-sided discussion continued as it  had before, in our silence.  This is the kind of thing that impacts  on every single woman of colour who is  conscious of the colour-white dynamic; this  is the kind of thing that makes us angry.  In Chrystos' same poem, she reflects on  this situation and the anger that she consequently feels: My mouth cracks in familiar shock my eyes flee to the other faces  where my rage desperation fear pain ricochet a thin red scream How can you  miss our brown and golden in this sea  of pink...Bitter boiling I can't see you.  Someone at this same workshop said that  anger is something women writers should  address because of its paralyzing effect on  one's abiHty to write. She also said that  anger stems from fear. It is true that anger  is something Native women writers should  address because it is a very significant  theme and force in our writing. However,  the concept of fear as a root of anger is not  true for women of colour. The anger is a direct result of feehng, and in fact, being powerless and unheard in terms of the dominant  European.  The theme of much of our writing is  anger at those conditions and forces that  have sought to render Native people powerless and voiceless: residential schools, the  Church and its missionaries; white tyrannical teachers trying to make Indian students beheve their ways, beliefs, language,  rehgion, and physical being are of no value;  child abduction, rape, murder, sterilization,  germ warfare in the form of diseased blankets, and even up until just thirty short  years ago the denial of legal and pohtical  representation.  In terms of this struggle, Paula Gunn  Allen says, in The Sacred Hoop: "For  women this means fighting...sometimes violent and always virulent racist attitudes  and behaviours directed against us by an  entertainment and educational system that  wants only one thing from Indians: our silence, our invisibility, our collective death."  She goes on to cite an example of what  kinds of things are being done to us collectively: "It is beheved that at least 80 percent of the Native women seen at the regional psychiatric service centrc.have experienced some sort of sexual assault." Not  only do Native women have to deal with  the hardships the average white person has  but our load is magnified by the poverty,  racist sexism, without the benefit of coping mechanisms, because our family structures were decimated. If there is fear beneath our anger it is the fear that our multi-  generational anger might be unjustly and  accidently hurled on to one of our own or  on the innocent or on one of the truth seekers in our hves.  In / Am Woman, Lee Maracle articulates the condition of this anger: "I am torn  apart and terrorized, not by you, my love,  but by the war waging inside mc.Now you  will be watchful, wary, waiting for my hysteria. Just as I am on guard against your  anger." The victim of our large and looming  anger is our very selves. We are powerless  to act out anger any other way. The suicide  rate of young Native people is now eerily  famous and is mourned in Slash, I Am  Woman, and The Sacred Hoop. We turn  anger inward because it is hard to make out  who the real enemy is—a belief system. This  dilemma is found in Lee Maracle's poem  "Hate": Blinded by niceties and polite  liberality, we can't see our enemy, so,  we 11 just have to kill each other.  By illuminating the real enemies, real  sources, from which our self-inflicted pains/  violence stem, Maracle clarifies for Native  people what is clearly going on and what the  dynamics and forces are which have shaped  our history and which are shaping our lives  today. We have a place to start to change  those conditions in our Hves which oppress  us, a place and knowledge with which to empower ourselves.  Perhaps the fear the woman at the workshop spoke of was the fear of where the  power of one's anger will be directed. Let it  be clarified that the real root to all of this  silence, anger, fear is the very real racism  Native women are trying to survive. Racism  and sexism implicate one's whole being—it  is hard not to reflect on these experiences  frequently and almost obsessively. Much of  Maracle's I Am Woman addresses the re-  aHty of racism and internaHzed racism. In  speaking about the people she loves she  says: "In all of the stories runs a single common thread; racism is for us not an ideology  in the abstract, but a very real and practical part of our Hves. The pain, the effect,  the shame are all real."  We are able to survive through writing.  Through writing we are able to defend who  we are and educate other people about what  our real experience is.  Kerrie Charnley is a freelance writer  living in Vancouver.

Chrystos  KINESIS    MarehS Women in VIEW, reviewed:  Fishy tales, busted hearts  and a percussive clarinet  TALES FROM A BROKEN HEART  by Jennifer Martin  MERMAID IN LOVE  written & performed by Shawna Dempsey  TOO BLONDE  written & performed by Beatrice  ZeiHnger k Sharon Heath  directed by Robin Nichol  by Gladys We  Tales from a Broken Heart was a collection of stories about a group of friends  who have met every year since high school  to see what has transpired over the past  year. The play began with the urban legend  of the globe-trotting garden gnomes, an implausible story which was soon overwhelmed  by the true stories of the women. Of the six  characters, one lost a lot of money, two left  their husbands (one came out as a lesbian,  the other's husband abused their daughter),  one became pregnant, one's sister died, and  one kicked a cocaine addiction.  The major strength of Tales from a  Broken Heart was its diversity of characters. However, this was also its weakest point. Because so much was concentrated into the characters, they became  stereotypes—the woman who was abused as  a child, the busy career woman with a cocaine addiction. Each woman became a token, a newspaper headHne.  However, Tales was also the story of a  generation of women. Brought up on the  feminism of the 1960's, when some women  were taught to beheve they could do anything they wanted, these women have discovered that there are stiU many boundaries  to their Hves. In a bitter Httle revue on being "good girls", they find that "good girls  aren't born this way—they're made this  way—when they give up on themselves." Finally, they take charge of their Uves. As one  woman declared, "I don't want to leave behind any more of my dreams."  The theme of taking charge was also  found in Mermaid in Love. Mermaid  and author Shawna Dempsey has rewritten  the saga of Ulysses to reflect what it really was—a patriarchal quest for glory and  wealth. According to the mermaid, Ulysses  was a real estate agent for the Greek middle class, traveUing through the islands to  buy cheap land. What he couldn't buy, he  stole. And of course, what he couldn't steal,  he destroyed. (Today, we watch the destruction of Baghdad, for much the same reasons.  The more things change...)  Our mermaid Hves in the Love canal, the  infamous site in New York State. First used  as a dumping site for tonnes of industrial  chemicals, the area was later sold to young  famiUes in the 1950's as an ideal place to  raise chUdren. They would, of course, see  this dream turn into a nightmare, as chUdren were born with birth defects, or grew  sick and died. The story of the Love Canal  is also the story of the condition of "love" in  our society, a place where "one of seven residents have significant chromosomal dam-  MacLaughlin in Smudge  age," a place where significant "chemical"  deposits are made.  Mermaid in Love was both a polished,  witty show and a metaphor for the pUght  of women through the ages. As the mermaid said, "AU women pay for their fishy  tales." But in the end, she vows to Hsten to her heart (quite HteraUy). She abandons the romance of Love, a dream that  "leaves us strung out and lets us Uve in  the future rather than work to change the  present," and declares herself a "mythological terrorist for truth." She has been transformed through the ages—from dangerous  seductress to vengeful Medusa to the voiceless Little Mermaid. Now, she vows to take  charge of her own representation.  Too Blonde was a platinum parody  of social stereotypes featuring Beatrice  ZeiHnger and Sharon Heath. Too Blonde  consisted of series of loosely connected  sketches, aU about the Uves of blondes. For  example, there was a hysterical spoof of a  feminine hygiene ad. When her daughter  complains of "feminine itching," the mother  suggests VagisU, which she's been using for  30 years. Asks her daughter, "You've been  itchy that long?!?" And then there was the  "Blonde-off" at the Love Ranch, a game-  show parody, where contestants competed  to be the most blonde.  Too Blonde walked the dangerous Une  between parody and perpetuation of stereotypes. In its funniest moments were also  its most cynical and bitter messages. When  a woman executive feels powerful, she  screams, "I feel Hke a man!" We laughed  at the blonde who says, "We didn't use  anything—but I went to the bathroom afterwards, which helps." This naivete stuns  us but we recognize in it the hundreds of  "SmUes of the Day" who all read Stephen  King, Danielle Steele and Garfield. And  then we're told, "Looking professional is  being professional. If you care about your  looks, then others wUl think you're a  professional—even if you aren't." Contemporary advice, indeed, in an age where style  seems to be of more value than substance.  EMMA STORROW  by Leshe HaU Pinder  performed by Trish Grainge  directed by Jane Heyman  by Meg Edwards  Emma Storrow is the tale of a 42-year  old woman's trip to England, a journey that  becomes fantastic in the telhng as Emma  finds significance in each word and each image she recaUs. Emma's story becomes an  Alice in Wonderland adventure, an enjoyable trip into the imagination as weU as a  journey of self-discovery. Pinder's style is  dense and poetic, rich with aUusions, echoes  and symbohc images.  Emma travels to a palace on a mountain  and can only get down by hitching a ride  with "ample apple women in brown coats."  She plays chess with a strange man in the  tube, who explains to her the power of the  Queen. She takes a subway ride to the bowels of the earth and successfuUy escapes a  sexual attack just outside the door of her  friends home, by a man who had been shadowing her throughout the story.  n i nnTnirn nninntiHHUHHHmHMHiiHiHftfMH*=i HMi i h > ■! nH^tM~Hr4; -inirrini ■ mi; ■ i ■ iu ■ ■ ■ u-■» uh ■ ninHnHHnunniMHtMUMin uuiuifiiniUHH ■ i Hiri i i i; Ht ft-Mt ;m-:£3  KINESIS M"CH91 Shawna Dempsey in Mermaid In Love  Emma, read by Trish Grainge with sincerity and force, tells the story from her Hving room at home. The power of the performance and the simphcity of the set created  a close, personal atmosphere. Emma's revelation is not simply about sexuahty or violence or the escape from her "paper thin  Hfe," it is a discovery of the riches within  her mind. She reaHzes that the answer is  not only to say 'yes' to Ufe, but in some circumstances to be able to say 'no'.  At the beginning of her tale Emma describes her sensations as being blown apart  Hke a broken puzzle. Her final analogy is  quite different. She sees herself as having  broken the skin of a pomegranate. Inside  she discovers a cavern of dehcious jewels  that is her own Ufe and existence. She is  awakened to the 'Kingdom' within and her  role there as Princess, Queen, or God. The  metaphors in the story jostle each other Uke  the many bright cells of the pomegranate.  The story is further enhanced by Emma's  dry British wit. Her stiff upper Hp attitude  adds the necessary comic rehef to this fantastical tale.  BASSISH VOICES  performed by Lori Freedman,  Lola MacLaughhn & Graham Ord  by Ruth Taylor  Musician Lori Freeman's program at  Women in View was a coUection of four  pieces grouped under the title Bassish  Voices, a particularly apt description as  the expression Freeman achieves with her  bass clarinet goes beyond what one might  usuaUy expect of a musical instrument. Her  music is more analogous to a human voice,  capable of rich melodies but also of conversation and even complaints. Nor does  Freedman restrict herself to the use of  the bass clarinet simply as a wind instrument. In Snake Charmer, composed by  Istvan Dedic, her clarinet becomes a percussion instrument; in Smudge, choreographed  by Lola MacLaughlin (who performs with  Freedman) with music by David Maclntyre,  it is a dancer. For the audience, especially  those of us unfamUiar with the work of these  performers, Bassish Voices was a rewarding experience.  The program opened with Warm Satin  (pour e.l), a solo piece composed by Freedman. Warm Satin was Uke a gentle introduction to what was to come: more conventional in form than the other works, the  piece is warm and provocative. And beautiful, as evidenced by the hush in the audience just before applause broke out.  The next piece, Snake Charmer, was  more outlandish. Also a solo performance  by Freedman, the work is based around a refrain which she plays variously by using the  bass clarinet, or only its mouthpiece, or by  drumming on the instrument and even by  tapping glasses of water with a spoon. The  music becomes a shghtly comic obsession—  hence the name of the piece.  In Gahn-gah-du Freedman was joined  by cc-composer Graham Ord, on soprano  saxophone. Gahn-gah-du is a wonderful  work, my favourite of the evening. The  piece begins as a normal sort of duet,  the two voices exchanging phrases, sometimes overlapping, sometimes coining together, but somewhere in the middle an argument erupts. This is not, however, your  classic "duelhng banjos" confrontation. At  one point, with Ord off on a flight-of-fancy  solo, Freedman interrupts with the aural  equivalent of someone resentfuUy sticking  their tongue out at a show-off. Perhaps it  was a demand to be heard. Peace is eventuaUy made and the performers end in harmony.  Much of Gahn-gah-du is improvisa-  tional. As Freedman explains: "Whatever  we played is from each other's voices." She  doesn't see the piece as a dialogue between  two separate entities, but rather "two voices  in me." Gahn-gah-du contains within it  the elements I enjoyed so much in the overaU program—beauty of expression coupled  with a "don't take yourself too seriously"  sense of playfulness.  In the dance-piece Smudge, Freedman  was joined by dancer/choreographer Lola  MacLaughhn in a work in which Freedman's  physical presence on stage, as weU as her  music, is an integral part of the dance. Although they seem unaware of each other,  MacLaughhn and Freedman act as partners,  the one balancing the other. It is almost  an unacknowledged dialogue. The rare moments in which they make contact come almost as a surprise—as much to the performers as to the audience—and are therefore all the more special. As Freedman said,  they are the moments in which "an individual comes face-to-face with another part of  themself."  It is obvious, especiaUy from Smudge,  that Lori Freedman is interested in incorporating different aspects of staged performance into her work. Although she says she  is also interested in classical performance,  she prefers a less formal setting in which the  distance between audience and performer is  reduced. This would not take the form of  audience participation but, as she said, "using the space of the audience." Certainly  Bassish Voices succeeded in reducing the  psychological space between audience and  performer. For me, a newcomer to Freedman's music, Bassish Voices was an accessible performance I would recommend to  both connoisseurs and the uninitiated.  Lori Freedman will perform a set with  Graham Ord on April 18th at, The Glass  Slipper.  Ruth Taylor is a student at Simon  Fraser University who is interested in  dance.  Forum:  Strategies to beat  the racist heat  by Gladys We  In a white man's world, how does a woman of colour survive? At the FirehaU Forum at  this year's Women in View Festival, four women of colour, Maria CampbeU, Rita DevereU,  Lorena Gale and Ruby Truly, came together to discuss their personal strategies for survival. The discussion, moderated by Yasmin Jiwani, was warm, inspiring and enUghtening.  Lorena Gale spoke first about her experiences as a Black actor in Canada. Three times  Gale has been typecast into the role of the Black maid. The first time, she played a subservient worker. The second time, Gale unconsciously changed the part—and no one else  realized what she had done either. And the third time, she first refused the part, then accepted it but on her own terms-that she could play the character, not as written, but as  she felt it should be played, with dignity.  Gale also spoke of the racism of other actors. When she played a Black maid, for example, she was often expected to fetch things backstage. Gale also related some experiences  of solidarity. When a director told her that she couldn't audition for a CBC pUot about  a women's basebaU team because she was Black, other actors raised their hands, asking:  "Do you want an ItaUan first baseman? Do you want a Jewish manager?" Thirty of the  forty-five auditioners refused to audition, and the pUot was cancelled.  Ruby Truly, who described herself as an "ESL survivor," told of her discovery of acting  in high school in HawaU. Truly, who is of Japanese descent, said acting was a way to lose  herself, to escape from her Ufe into another world, where she was not limited to one famUy or colour or sex. When she was twenty years old, she was sexuaUy harassed by a director on HawaU 5-0. Rather than being sympathetic, her co-workers told her, "H you can't  stand the heat, get out of the fire." The experience shaped Truly, who is now a video artist  in BC. She said, "Being in control of my own image puts me in the driver's seat." She felt  that a performer's ethnicity should colour her characters in, not whiten them out. And, as  a strategy for survival, she recommended that people of colour help each other and support each other's learning processes.  Rita DevereU, a Black broadcast journalist originaUy from Texas, regularly hosts Vision  TV. DevereU, who has a background in performance, offered her five-part strategy for survival:  • Know what you do, find people who share your vision, and work with them. Don't waste  your time with people who "block" you.  • Don't blame the victim, blame the criminal. Don't lose your self-respect if a person won't  work with you because of your colour. Fight it through the union, if you can.  • Find solidarity with other performers, so that you wiU have others to help you in your  struggle against racism.  • Create your own work, and when you can't work, add more skiUs to your repertoire.  • Build-and use-an "old girls' network" so that if you don't have the skiUs or knowledge  for a task, you wUl be able to find someone who can help you. And, as a final note, DevereU added, "Always do what you must to survive."  Maria CampbeU, Metis author of Halfbreed, said, "Surviving racism is Uke surviving  the weather. You get up, look outside and dress for it." She added that she didn't write to  create, but to survive. Writing Halfbreed enabled her to "blame the criminal," and start to  heal her Hfe. CampbeU offered a parable of Hfe as a long and steep hUl which people must  chmb. "Some people get partway up, and then faU aU the way back down. But there are  people to walk with you, and there are people ahead of you who are wUUng to help you up to  where they are." She reminded the audience to: "remember the elders—in your community  and in the arts community. You don't have to re-learn the same things, every generation."  The forum was an inspiring event. As Rita DevereU said, "Every human is someone  who wUl reveal themselves—as an artist, and a vehicle for their cultures." Maria CampbeU added, "Canadians don't know where they fit in Canadian culture, either. We're in a  chaos and out of chaos, something good may happen. We're watching the birthing of something new." Even though the birthing process is full of pain, these women offered some  hope that change is happening.  Gladys We defines herself as a synthesis of Chinese, as she was born, Canadian,  as she was raised, and feminist, which she has chosen.  ms^^,^.^^^^^^^^s^^s^^m^^^^^.^Bmmm^ms&^ms^m^^mmm^m^^-^m  KINESIS ss**ss^*^^^*s*^^  ARTS  La tete anglaise, le coeur francais  DE BEAUX GESTES AND  BEAUTIFUL DEEDS  a play by Marie Lynn Hammond  directed by Rejean Poirier  Pink Ink Theatre, Theatre La Seizieme  by Meg Edwards  De Beaux Gestes and Beautiful Deeds  is a bUingual (French/English) play, which  makes it uniquely Canadian. Those of us  who are not comfortably bUingual wiU discover their limitations, as indeed I did—  and it was my loss. Playwright Marie Lynn  Hammond's auto-biographical work had the  fuUy bUingual members of the audience  laughing heartUy. My companion, who has  a good grasp of Parisian French (the kind  most anglophone Canadians are taught,  rather than Quebecois French, the language  of Quebec) also had some difficulty following the dialogue and songs. Hammond's  play certainly points out the difficulties facing artists who attempt to tackle the "two  solitudes."  De Beaux Gestes can be best described  a musical. Chantal Morin, a singer and  performer from Montreal, plays Marie Lynn  Hammond (Hammond is a weU-known musician and composer, formerly with String-  band, with a successful career as a solo performer). We see Hammond at her electric  piano in an attic full of her grandmothers'  memorabiha. As she wanders through her  memories, collecting them into songs, her  two grandmothers visit to teU their own sto-  Her Enghsh grandmother, Elsie, played  a tad stiffly by Lois Dellar, is a rich  and spoUt Protestant. Corrine, the French  Canadian grand-mere, is poor and Cathohc.  The grandmothers are Hammond's chosen  muses for lyrical inspiration. Her songs relate their Hves and (true) stories. Her EngUsh grandmother was a 'wild' woman who  left her first husband to marry a BC bush  pUot. She leaves her rich, cultured and boring Hfe behind her for the love of romance.  Her Hfe is a scandal and she Hves up to it  by wearing shocking red dresses to subdued  parties. Her dream was to learn how to fly.  In contrast, grandmere Corrine married  at 16, obeying her parent's wUl. Her first  husband slowly and painfuUy dies of cancer. Her next husband is many years her  senior. They have eight kids and are extremely poor. (I confess to being weak on  these facts.)  Despite, or perhaps because of, the contrast between the two grandmothers, their  meeting at the end of the play is very sat-  "We're the women of the union and we've just begun  to fight,  We have learned of women's issues, we have learned  of women's rights,  We're prepared to stand for freedom, we're prepared  to stand our ground,  Women make the union strong..."  Solidarity Forever  Mk  B.C. FEDERATION OF LABOUR (CLC)  isfying. They both oppose the marriage of  Hammond's parents because of what they  see as irreconcUable differences in their  backgrounds and cultures. For me, this was  the play's best scene, with the basics of good  theatre: dialogue, confrontation, movement.  It was a reUef to feel that the play was finally going somewhere.  Hammond's role, for example, could have  been expanded. I would haveUked to see her  speak to her grandmothers and have some  of her idealistic images of them dispeUed  by the complexity of a real person's experiences. De Beaux Gestes is a sentimental  play that does nothing to revise the stereotypes we are taught about the clashes between Enghsh and French Canadians. Hammond's final song, "la tete anglaise et le  coeur frangais", seems to reflect those accepted myths of the dichotomy between the  two cultures.  Certainly this distance exists (witness  the Umitations of the audience). However,  Nicole Robert's captivating portrayal of  grandmere did provide me with a bridge of  sorts. The most satisfying musical moments  are those in which Robert and Morin sing  Quebecois folk music. Moreover, Robert's  body language and facial expressions, encouraging laughter, provided engaging clues  to her meanings for those of us who do not  share her language.  icLeod*'  USED & OLD  BOOKS  GOUC-WT S.

Strategizing:  Helpful tools, but weak process  by Lorraine Michael  STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE:  From women's experience to a plan for  action  by Debra J. Lewis with Jan Barnsley  Vancouver: The Women's Research Centre,  1990  One thing sure to make a community organizer smUe is a new tool to help with  planning strategy. It was therefore with  great interest that I read Strategies for  Change, an Ulustrated, large format guide  written and published by Vancouver's feminist Women's Research Centre.  From the book's beginning, the authors  show a clear commitment to creating organizing strategies buUt on women's experience. They take the position that poUtical change wUl not come about without  weU thought out strategies, and base their  approach on "the assumption that how we  work for change is as important as raising  the issue itself."  Strategies for Change is divided into  two parts—almost two separate books with  neither part dependent on the other— although that was probably not the authors'  intention. Part one, "The Story of Three  Issues," presents case studies of how three  groups in Vancouver worked on issues affecting women. Under examination are wage  discrimination and pay equity, wife assault,  and custody law—issues which are timely  and, unfortunately, wUl remain so for a long  time.  This section is very informative. The historic background in each case is good and  the account of each group—Vancouver's  Committee on Affirmative Action for Wo-  Women & AIDS:  Analysis and experience  by Robin Barnett  CANADIAN WOMEN AND AIDS:  Beyond the Statistics  ed. by Jacquie Manthorne  Montreal:   Les  editions  communiqu'eUes,  1990  WOMEN, AIDS & ACTIVISM  by The ACT UP/New York  Women and AIDS Book Group  Boston: South End Press, 1990  How fortunate these two books about  women and AIDS were published at the  same time, since they complement each  other so weU. As weU, they have been hotly  anticipated because there is so Httle written on the subject. Both are collections of  essays, interviews, personal accounts and  documentation about programs for women.  Canadian Women and AIDS has French  and Enghsh contributions, with short summaries in the other language accompanying  each piece.  Both books seek to make sense of the impact of AIDS from a feminist perspective.  Their greatest value is in giving a voice to  women's experiences and in analyzing the  many facets of women and AIDS. Facts play  a secondary role in these books because, as  the authors acknowledge, women have been  left out of research and epidemiology for too  long—there just isn't the same amount of  "hard" information about women and ADDS  as there is about men, due to official neglect.  The importance of Women, AIDS and  Activism Hes in its many incisive pohtical statements about women and AIDS  in the United States. Produced by women  from ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash  Power) the book seeks to cover the diverse  issues of women involved in community-  based HIV/AIDS work. Not aU the content is relevant to the Canadian experience,  but we do learn a lot about the pohtics  of AIDS in the US. There, women infected  and affected by AIDS are predominantly  Black and Hispanic women: HIV infection is  clearly connected with poverty and racism.  The Canadian experience about women  and AIDS is yet to be fully understood.  Racism and poverty, while part of the picture, are not always definitive. In BC,  women Uving with HIV seem to come  from varied backgrounds. Our numbers are  nowhere as great as those in the US. For example, women are 10 percent of the people  Hving with ADDS in the US; in Canada, we  are 5 percent.  ...women have been  left out of research  and epidemiology  for too long...  The Canadian pubUc rarely hears from  women Hving with HIV/ADDS and one  of the greatest strengths of Canadian  Women and AIDS are the first person accounts. However, a major omission in the  book is the experience of women from First  Nations, who are thought to be at greater  risk for HIV infection than other Canadian  women.  WhUe transmission from sharing needles  is a concern for women in Canada, the  majority of women in this country have  been infected sexuaUy, quite often from having unsafe sex with men who have unsafe sex with other men. We read accounts from a dozen Canadian women Hving with HIV/AIDS including a Quebecoise,  a lesbian from Alberta and a woman  from Hahfax who was sexuaUy assaulted  in the months prior to testing positive.  We hear concerns about chUdren, sexuaUty,  rape, needle use and recovery from lesbians  and heterosexual women. We're told about  fears, but we get a sense that these women  are Uving and coping with HIV/ADDS, not  with a death sentence. Many speak of the  positive ways that Uving with HIV has  changed their Uves.  Their stories and their voices make clear  the need for women-specific services and  programs to meet women's unique needs.  Meeting other women with HIV/ADDS is  important to them aU. Sharing experiences  is a buUding block of both the ADDS and  women's health movement. WhUe there is a  common thread in these stories, the reader  wUl also be able to understand how difficult it is for women with such diverse backgrounds to sustain support groups and figure out just what the bonds are for women  with HIV/ADDS.  One of the most interesting articles in  Women, AIDS & Activism is "Reproductive Rights and ADDS: The Connections" by Marion Banzhaf, Tracy Morgan  and Karen Ramspacher. These women look  at the women's health movement as the historical foundation from which we can now  look at AIDS and reproductive rights. The  reproductive rights movement grew out of  the abortion movement in the US to include issues of racism and classism, sterUization abuse, control over our bodies and  sexual preferences. Women and AIDS issues  include control over one's health care, self-  empowerment, informed consent, the right  to have or not have chUdren and the right to  be sexual. AIDS issues are indeed reproductive rights issues. The links these authors  make provide us with a framework for programming, pohcy recommendations and activism.  These books provide poignant and powerful insights into the unique nature of  women's experiences with HIV infection,  experiences which also highhght longstanding feminist concerns about global health is-  Robin Barnett is on staff at the  Vancouver-based Women and AIDS  project.  men in the Civic Workforce, the India  MahUa Society, and the Support Group on  Custody and Access—holds the reader's attention.  At the end of each study is an evaluation—"Learning from Our Experience."  The strong point of these sections is the  focus on planning around the specifics of  the issues. Unfortunately, the authors faU to  ...strategy planning  requires much more  time  provide an evaluation on the internal working of the groups and how that affected their  strategies. An assessment of how the groups  began and operated would have been helpful.  Part two, "Developing a Strategy for  Change," offers a framework for women's  groups to initiate strategy discussions. This  section's strong point is that the steps for  action are basic and are described without  the compUcation of jargon. The four steps  are Grounding the Issue, Defining the Issue,  Developing the Strategy, and Preparing for  Results.  However, the busy manner in which these  steps are presented counteracts the benefits of their simpUcity and makes the section  difficult to get through. WhUe the various  planning charts and diagrams are weU-laid  out and easy to foUow, they would be improved by less wordy explanations. As weU,  the authors would have done weU to confine  their examples to one issue only—switching  from issue to issue, as they do, is confusing.  Surprisingly, the book suggests that all  four steps could effectively be covered in  a weekend. Experienced community organizers wiU find that such strategy planning requires much more time to allow for  a process of reflection-action-reflection each  step of the way. For example the first step,  "Grounding the Issue," involves a very important aspect of strategizing: determining  who's not in the group but might need to  be there, something the authors recognize  as crucial.  It therefore seems logical that step two,  "Developing the Issue," might have to be  put on hold untU the group decides whether  or not it needs to add members before going further. Such a decision could be essential to the rest of the planning and the effectiveness of subsequent actions.  On the whole Strategies for Change is  very strong on the content of the issues explored, and presents helpful planning tools.  However, the book's approach to process is  weak. A good foUow-up chapter would have  been to work through the strategy steps  with a group involved in an actual planning  process. The resulting report and evaluation  would then reveal a direct experience of the  process outhned.  Trained faciUtators wUl find Strategies  for Change helpful. Their experience wUl  enable them to both pick up the book's new  tools and to see the weaknesses in the process presented. Women's groups who are inexperienced in strategy planning and need  clear guidelines might find the book less  helpful than they'd Hke it to be.
