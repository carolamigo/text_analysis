"We are going to fight and we're going to  get what we want," said Marceline Manuel  of Vancouver. "We don't need a department  of Indian affairs."  Throughout the day, it was business as  usual at the museum. The doors were kept  open and there was no tension between the  Indians and staff. In fact, the Indians  were officially welcomed by UBC president  Doug Kenny and museum director Michael  Ames.  The museum staff ordered food and coffee  for the group, and set up a play area for  the children.  angry conversations with Trudeau, and  at all times defiantly condemning the  constitution.  "In our opinion Canada is guilty of  genocide and ethnicide," Hanse said. "We  are trying to draw attention to the  problem we've got. We have been ignored  in the constitution and we think that's  ridiculous.  "We hope the Canadian people will not  allow this to happen, or they will be as  guilty of genocide and ethnicide as the  government. We're hoping the rest of  Canada will rise up with us."  Hanse said the Indians intended to stay  only one day, but he hoped the attention  gained would be long lasting and have an  impact on Ottawa.  The atmosphere in the museum was heavily  emotional.  There was an awesome sense of pride and  dignity in the rituals, but the singing  and dancing were also joyous, invigorating and optimistic.  At the same time, the intense resentment  felt towards Trudeau and the gravity with  which they viewed the future were ever  present.  At one point in the afternoon, a man  wearing a Trudeau mask faced the people's  questions.  Beatrice Jack, of Mawatchist, B.C.,  asked, "Why don't you look at your own  back yard, where the poor people are,  the people that own this country? Why  don't you look at our people?  "I am 66 years old and I have suffered  66 years. I don't want my children to  suffer again."  Constitution update . . .  The continuing protests of Indian people  have had some effect. Shortly after the  Museum of Anthropology sit-in and the demonstrations which followed the next day,  premiers began to change their positions  regarding entrenchment of aboriginal rights  The about-face was surprisingly quick. Too  quick, in fact, to allow us to believe that  exclusion of aboriginal rights was ever  legitimate in the first place.  The premiers reacted to the enormous furor  raised by their omission, yet not enough  to betray their own vested interests. They  accepted entrenchment of aboriginal rights,  then quickly added the word "existing" to  aboriginal rights defined therein.  Since very few aboriginal claims have been  settled to date in this country, this will  most certainly undercut future legal battles to broaden or further specify aboriginal claims.  This is of course, an unsatisfactory compromise, but one which is difficult to  fight at this, the eleventh hour. Protests  continue, but it appears that the final  vote on the constitution will have taken  place by the first week in December.  One remaining hope is the current legal  battle of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs  in London. They are attempting to force  England to acknowledge the validity of  treaties it signed a century ago, so as  to provide a solid base for future claims  struggles in Canada. 0_ December/January 1982    Kinesis    3  ACROSS B.C.  Mental Health Act amended without consultation  by Nicole Laplante  The directors of mental institutions in  B.C. now have the power to authorize  treatment for new categories of involuntarily admitted patients. Like prisoners,  for example.  The amendments to the Mental Health Act,  which most citizens in B.C. have probably  never heard about were voted on last  June and came into force August 4.  What this means is that the law now  authorizes the director of a provincial  mental facility and a person in charge of  a psychiatric unit to sign "consent to  treatment" forms on behalf of a patient  detained in such a facility. The treatment is then deemed to be given with the  patient's consent.  Even if the patient is, in law, capable  of making her or her own decisions and of  managing his or her own affairs, he/she  can have his/her decision over-ridden by  the director.  Changes affect prisoners most  To whom does this law apply?  * A person admitted involuntarily on  one medical certificate under section 23  of the Act;  * A person admitted involuntarily after  being apprehended by police and certified  for an emergency admission of up to 72  hours by a doctor under section 24(1) of  the Act;  * A person arrested under a Form A warrant and admitted to hospital for up to  72 hours under section 24(2) of the Act;  * A person transferred to a mental institution from a correctional centre or from  a prison or lock-up operated by a police  force under section 25 of the Act;  * A person detained in a provincial men  tal health facility after having been  found not guilty of a criminal charge by  reason of insanity, or unfit to stand  trial by reason of insanity.  "Before the amendments to the Mental  Health Act were adopted, these categories  of patients may have been treated with or  without their consent. The law, then, did  not allow it. Now it does," explains  Gerald Green, lawyer with the Vancouver  Community Legal Assistance Society and  Riverview patients' advocate.  "These amendments are very important  changes in the law. They have been made  without sufficient, if any, consultation  with the public," Green says.  In the legislative process, there must be  advance consultation with interested and  affected people by those responsible for  drafting changes in the law. For that  reason, three readings have to be made.  The first reading is notification to the  public and legislators. Media and official  opposition are alerted, to ensure the  bill's implications are understood. The  second reading is so principles can be  discussed, after which there is the  committee stage for detailed examination  and amendment. The third reading is for  reconsideration.  Fight these amendments now  "The first and second readings were so  close that there was no time for debate,"  complains Green. "These amendments were  not even listed under the Mental Health  Act. They were under the Miscellaneous  Statute Amendments Act, with 26 other  different acts."  The amendments to the Mental Health Act  were made in such a way that interested  people, concerned or affected by these  changes, had no opportunity to express  their opinions.  Did the government only consult people  it thought would accept the amendments?  It didn't consult the Canadian Mental  Health Society, or many doctors and lawyers who could have opposed the changes.  What can the general public do?  Express your dissatisfaction. Make a lot  of noise. Send delegations to the Ministry of Health and to the opposition.  Write to the media. Meet with the directors of provincial mental institutions.  Let the government know you don't agree  with the secrecy of its consultation  system.  Q  Biting back against welfare cutbacks  by Evelyn Hollander  Saturday, November 21 was a cloudy, rainy  day, a characteristic backdrop to a demonstration protesting welfare cutbacks.  The 500 demonstrators were protesting outside the sumptuous Hyatt Regency hotel,  where the Social Credit party was holding  its annual convention.  People of all ages and ethnic groups, two  parent as well as single parent families,  were represented at the demonstration. One  picketer's sign read: "They say cut back,  we say fight back!"  The signs demonstrators carried clearly  showed they are concerned with improving  their futures - and this can only come  through further education, job training or  retraining. Thus demonstrators were particularly concerned about recent education  cutbacks; a group of Vancouver Community  College students was there to support that  concern.  Welfare Rights Coalition were picketing  the hotel along with members of the Rollback Coalition (which includes organizations like Downtown Eastside Residents'  Association, labour unions and the B.C.  Association of Social Workers).  Things heated up suddenly when a group of  protesters charged into the Hyatt Regency,  screaming "we want Grace, we want Grace."  McCarthy came out of the ballroom to speak  to protesters, but was quickly drowned out.  (Apparently she retreated into the ball-  of six months and work. "You're talking to  the wrong person. I completely agree with  Gracie."  The demonstrators had opposing interests  and views.  Raising a child is a job that should be respected in our society.  If the government is the people, then the children are people  too, and they need to be provided for properly.  room saying, "These people are something  else. They don't want to communicate.")  Organizers eventually brought the melee to  a halt, but not before security guards had  a chance to exercise some muscle, and at  least one demonstrator bit back.  During the uproar, I waylaid a member of  the Socreds (who wishes to remain unnamed)  and asked him if he thought it was right  that a mother with a six-month-old child  should have to leave it to go out and work.  He thought it was a splendid idea, saying,  "My wife did it."  I then approached a well-dressed, elegant  woman, thinking she would be more sympathetic. But she was even more adamant that  mothers should leave their kids at the age  Deborah Carr of Gibsons, B.C., a mother  of a five-year-old boy, who had to spend  part of her food money to attend, said:  "Raising a child is a job that should be  respected in our society. If the government is the people, then the children  are people too, and they need to be provided for properly."  Corinne Lightfoot, a guitar-toting mother  of two boys, emphasized that "bringing up  children is a responsible job. To be able  to do that job well, we need education,  good day care, proper housing.  "Has Gracie ever experienced poverty? She  should try it. Otherwise, she doesn't have  a clue what she's talking about, and she  has no right making laws and judgments  about it."  0_ 4   Kinesis    December/January 1982  ACROSS CANADA  CACSW opposes erosion of women's rights in charter  by Nicole Laplante  The Canadian Advisory Council for the  Status of Women (CACSW) is determined to  oppose the constitutional package which  erodes guarantees of equality for women.  This decision was taken at CACSW's 10th  joint meeting of the Federal and Provincial Advisory Councils held in Vancouver  November 11. (The Quebec delegation was  absent, due to a boycott of all federal  meetings declared by Quebec Premier Rene  Levesque.)  In a telegram sent to the prime minister  and provincial premiers, CACSW warns it  "will collectively oppose any attempt to  diminish equal rights for women."  "We call on the provincial premiers for  the deletion of the 'over-ride provisions'  (the 'notwithstanding clause') from the  terms of the federal-provincial accord.  Alternatively, we ask that the premiers  recognize publicly that the equality guarantee (clause 28) was never  intended to  and will never be made subject to the  over-ride provision of the accord.  "Section 29 must  stand intact: 'Notwithstanding anything in this charter, the  rights and freedoms referred to in it are  guaranteed equally to male and female persons,'" reads the telegram.  (Because of public pressure like this,  some premiers have already changed their  tunes and are slowly proceeding to respect women's rights. )  B.C. women most active in Canada  Explaining why there were no B.C. representatives at the joint meeting, CACSW  president Lucie Pepin declared: "We held  our meeting here in Vancouver in order to  get feedback from B.C. women on issues of  concern to them. The women's movement  here is the most active in the country and  we depend on women here for research and  information on issues."  Members of CACSW would like to see B.C.  women lobby for a provincial Advisory  Council, but acknowledged that B.C. women  themselves must first recognize this as a  priority.  olutions were among  The role of an advisory council is to  liaise between public pressure groups and  provincial governments. Newfoundland's  representative at CACSW, Ann Bell, declared: "B.C. women are the leaders in the  country on women's issues, but the B.C.  government has not yet indicated they consider women's issues a priority."  Newfoundland's Advisory Council was set  up less than a year ago, with an annual  budget of $140,000!  At this 10th meeting, representatives of  25 or 30 B.C. women's groups came to hear  discussions on childcare, maternity leave,  employment for women, pensions and violence against women.  The following :  those adopted:  * That CACSW support the deletion of the  "magic 10 clause" for maternity benefits  and the incusion of benefits for adoptive  parents;  * That the Joint Status of Women Councils  urge every province to adopt an employment strategy for women in the 1980s to  include equal pay for work of equal value,  legislated affirmative action and contract  compliance, a comprehensive childcare policy which recognizes women's rights to  participate in the workforce, and training  programs for women displaced by technology  and women re-entering the workforce;  * That employers and employees be encouraged to negotiate clauses in collective  agreements that provide protection against  sexual harassment;  * That application for splitting of pension credits be permitted at any time until retirement, instead of only within  three years of the granting of a decree  absolute in a divorce case;  The Canadian Advisory Council for the  Status of Women will act as a clearing  house for pension information in the future. Ms. Pepin said that on such an important issue, it is vital that information reach all interested groups who  might be planning meetings or publishing  papers and briefs on the subject.  "We must all work closely together on  this," she said, "so that we can make  the best possible representation on pension security for women before government  legislation. It will be many years before  we have another chance."  It's not too late to think about the  security of your later years. For more  information, contact CACSW in Ottawa,  (613) 995-8284. Q  Inconsistencies still exist in  sex offense laws  by Jan DeGrass  Bill C-53, the federal government's  proposed amendments to the Criminal Code  regarding "sexual offences against the  person and the protection of young persons" has been receiving a lot of attention from women's organizations.  Since last year, the North Shore Women's  Centre has been circulating a petition  in support of MP Svend Robinson who  proposed that the Supreme Court:  (1) reclassify rape as a crime of violent  physical assault, and  (2) make unavailable to the rapist the  defence plea that they believed the woman  was consenting to intercourse even when  there was no reasonable grounds for that  belief.  This plea has been admissable for rapists  since the Pappajohn decision in May 1980.  Although Robinson's initial proposals were  slowed down by the crawl of parliamentary  procedure and Justice Minister Chretien's  contention that it was a "complex  question", some advances have been made.  The proposed amendments do represent a  change for the better. Two important  improvements are the reclassification of  rape and indecent assault as assault  offences, and the removal of spousal  immunity.  Recently the Women's Research Centre of  B.C. presented a brief to the Department  of Justice pointing out that the area  surrounding rape and sexual assault is  still not well-defined.  Inconsistencies  still exist, especially relating to the  matter of consent and honest belief in  sexual assault cases.  They recommend  that honest belief be based on reasonable  grounds and not be open to subjective  interpretation by the rapist or the jury.  The brief also proposes a series of  incremental minimum sentences for assault,  assault causing bodily harm, sexual  assault, and aggravated sexual assault,  with clear definitions for each increment.  They also recommend changes to the proposed amendments regarding the sexual -  exploitation of young persons, with provisions to cover adult women (as well as  children) who are coerced into participating in pornography.  The bill is expected to be re-introduced  during the coming session of parliament. Q  Daycare half the price of  welfare, study says  Toronto Metro Social Planning Council and  the Metro Social Services Department recently completed an updated study comparing the  cost of subsidized day care with the cost  of welfare to single mothers.  Their findings were decisive: "One dollar  of subsidized day care for single parents  on general welfare assistance would result  in net savings of more than two dollars to  the public through lower welfare costs."  The study found that the cost of a year's  day care for a mother with one pre-school  child would cost the municipality $2,836  whereas general welfare assistance for that  same mother would cost the municipality  $5,361.  The study concluded that providing subsidized day care to single welfare mothers  to enable them to find work would save  Metro Toronto millions over the long term.  (Action Day Care Newsletter,   Sept/81 )  VDT users need a break  Video display terminals (VDTs) are a health  hazard. A recent report by the Canadian  Union of Public Employees states that approximately 100,000 Canadian workers, a  majority of them women, are employed on  VDTs for at least part of their work day.  Of these, about one third have complained  of eye strain and temporary visual impairments .  CUPE, which is seeking guidelines for VDT  use to be included in collective agreements, has recommended that workers receive  a 20-minute break for every 40 minutes  spent on the machine.

The 1000 "public service announcements"  were circulated last August, showing a  clothed woman and a naked man. Posters  advise women to trust their instincts,  react quickly, and imagine their punch  going straight through the attacker. Graphics point out a woman's body weapons, and  a man's vulnerable spots, and suggest a  variety of physical tactics (kick, punch,  knee, bite).  The first reaction of Rochester's modest  police force was to scrape off the penis  area from the poster. Later the whole poster came down.  It's a safe bet that Rochester Women Against  Violence Against Women, who claim responsibility for the poster, can show the police  force a lot more obscene graphics and literature, now that the law seems to be taking the subject seriously, {info from Big  Mama Rag)  Nabisco women win major  sex discrimination suit  In one of the largest sex discrimination  cases ever, a $5 million settlement has  been reached with Nabisco Inc., the big  food and baking firm.  Under a preliminary agreement, Nabisco  has agreed to set up a minimum $5 million  fund for 8,000 women who have worked in 11  Nabisco bakeries since January 21, 1973.  The tentative agreement must still be  approved by the U.S. District Court in  Pittsburgh.  The suit charging the bakery with sex discrimination was filed in 1975 by 2 female  employees in Pittsburgh, and amended in  1976 to allege "discrimination on the  basis of sex in virtually all aspects of  employment at 11 of Nabisco's bakery operations throughout the United States."  These facilities account for 60 percent of  the company's total sales volume of more  than $2 billion.  "It is the most far-reaching sex discrimination case in equal employment history,"  said a spokesman for the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission. (Union Wage)  As a historian, she has devoted a great  deal of her work and research to unearthing  facts about Iranian women's activities in  the 19th and 20th centuries. She is unique  because she openly came out as a feminist  at a time when most Iranian women intellectuals were afraid to call themselves feminists.  In the summer of 1978 Nategh was one of the  few women in Iran who was prepared to talk  about feminist issues and Iranian women  without fear of being condemned as 'Westernized' .

A number of French feminists, including  Simone de Beauvoir and Christine Delphy  (of the theoretical journal Questions  Feministes,  now defunct but succeeded by  a new publication, Nouvelle Questions  Feministes),  have drawn up a series of  documents which traces the history of attempts by Psych et Po and its press, Des  Femmes, to dominate the entire French  women's movement.

(from off our backs)  Nicaragua outlaws sexist  advertising  Nicaragua's National Government for the  Reconstruction has passed a decree outlawing sexism in advertising.  Media themes that "do not promote the development and progress of culture and education" are forbidden under the new law.  Specifically, advertisements which use women  as sexual or commercial objects; which promote alcohol or cigarettes; which encourage  passivity, idleness or faith in chance as a  regulator of behavior; or which attack the  Nicaraguan nationality, language, or cultural and historical values, are outlawed.  It is interesting to see the difference in  emphasis between North American laws which  ban obscenity (meaning sexuality), and the  new Nicaraguan law which bans instead the  objedification of women.  This different perspective is surely due  largely to the presence of a strong women's  movement and organization throughout the  recent Nicaraguan revolution.

While McCarthy claims that by denying  GAIN benefits to single parents she is  trying to give them "the rehabilitative  tooks to get back on their feet", the  drastic reduction of the Canada Manpower  Training Program has all but eliminated  the opportunity for these people to acquire employable skills — certainly one  vital "rehabilitative tool."  To recap the story of the cutbacks in  April of this year, the provincial body  responsible for the story of the vocational institutes and colleges increased  by 35% the fees it charges the federal  Manpower Training Program for seats in  training courses.  Canada Employment &  Immigration Commission (CEIC) refused to  pay the additional charge.  Instead, it  reduced the number of trainees it sponsored through the Manpower Training Program.  Two hundred and eighty thousand  training days have been lost in B.C. as  a result.  More than 6000 seats have been eliminated  from pre-employment, pre-apprenticeship,  academic upgrading and English language  training programs.  These cutbacks affect  a large and vulnerable segment of society  without employable skills, including  women, single parents, immigrants, high  school dropouts, disabled people and former prisoners.  To protest the training cutbacks, a public  forum was held November 13 at Robson  Square Media Centre. At the forum, speakers  read briefs to a panel of federal, provincial and municipal politicians, and labor  and advisory representatives.  In all, eighteen briefs were presented,  by groups as varied as the Welfare Rights  Coalition, the Carpenters Apprenticeship  Joint Board, Vancouver Status of Women,  Vancouver Indian Centre Society and Native  Outreach Project, Women in Trades, and  the Public Service Alliance of Canada.  The presentations also included testimonials from individuals affected by the  cutbacks. Mayor Harcourt moderated the  forum.  The forum attracted an audience of over  100 people, and appears to have been a  success.  Organizers hoped to increase  public awareness so as to encourage public  pressure to reverse the cutbacks, and to  involve as panelists and speakers people  who night be in a position to help apply  pressure.  "political setup". He said his ministry's  budget for job training increased by $4  million from last year, but because provincial fee increases were decided without  consulting them, the extra costs were not  budgeted for, therefore seats bought from  the provincial government had to be cut  back.-  Nevertheless, as a result of the public  furor aroused by organizers of the forum,  the federal government has "found" $2  million (of the $8 million worth of seats  lost) to reinstate some programs. Unfortunately, no information has yet been  released on what programs the "found"  money is being applied to.  Public pressure is still needed to restore  training opportunities.

And municipal alderpeople  present agreed to present a resolution to  Vancouver city council urging the federal  government to make more funds available  for employment training programs, and  requesting the Vancouver Economic Advisory  Commission to address the issue of skilled  worker shortages and technological dislocation.  Lloyd Axworth, federal Employment and  Immigration minister, responded to news of  the forum by saying that blaming the federal government for the cutbacks was a  existed was never adequate.  Cutbacks only  make a bad situation much worse.  Readers can apply pressure by:  * making their views known to representatives at all levels of government;  * demanding that the federal government  find more money for training programs;  * demanding that the provincial government reinstate all seats eliminated as a  result of cutbacks (some seats merely  reverted to fee-paying rather than sponsored students, but many more were dropped  entirely. Some vocational programs have  been totally eliminated as a result.) 0_  Victim Assistance: women and children last?  by Debra Lewis  "Victim Assistance: Canada and the United  States" was held in Toronto from October  14-17. It was the first such conference  of Canadians involved in victim assistance.  The conference allowed participants to  gather information on victim services of  all types — from battering, to crimes  against the elderly, to arson, to robbery.  As is often the case, there was considerable variation in the usefulness of the  information presented. Representatives of  various government departments often presented rationales for limited funding.  The work of women in services for battered  women and sexual assault victims (while  always mentioned) was seldom given as much  recognition as it deserves.  However, there were some high points. Evan  Stark (co-author with Anne Flitcraft and  William Frazier of "Medicine and Patriarchal Violence: the Social Reconstruction  of a Private Event") spoke on the need to  identify battering as a political issue.  He said that violence against women is on  the increase, not only by husbands, but  by the state. He indicated that there is  often a tendency in times of fiscal restraint to devalue our own work; to believe  that "we aren't so good, they aren't so  bad."  We can guard against falling into that  trap by basing our work on a political  identification with battered women.  Stark also spoke of some recent work by  Flitcraft and himself. He said that  battering is seldom identified as the cause  of a range of other problems (from alcoholism to child abuse).  "Treating" the  secondary problem does nothing to deal  with the root cause.  Responses from participants working directly in programs for battered women was  encouraging. Almost invariably, they  stressed that battering must be identified  as a crime.  In Honolulu Hawaii, a Domestic Violence  Unit has been set up in the prosecutor's  office which has been effective in increasing arrests and convictions. The  Hotel and Restaurant Union in Connecticut  is currently advocating for women fired  for absenteeism due to battering.  Women in the small northern Ontario community of Atikokin have enlisted the support of local ministers in ongoing fund-  raising for their shelter, which has  housed 60 women and children in 4 months.  The conference also, unfortunately, had a  hidden agenda. During two meetings of  Canadian participants, a proposal was put  forward for the formation of a Canadian  victim assistance organization (to include  those working in services to all victims  of crimes). Many of us were taken by  surprise, and the proposal was vague and  open-ended.  The vast majority of women from services  for battered women and sexual assault victims expressed opposition to the proposal  for the following reasons:  1. An overall "victim assistance" organization would run the risk of putting  issues of concern to women as a low  priority. We already know from our work  on battering, for instance, that people  are much more likely to talk about husband  battering, child abuse, or granny bashing  despite the fact that wife battering constitutes the majority of cases.  When trade-offs are made in organizations  covering broad issues, it is often women  who lose.  This is not empty paranoia, but  a reflection of what we know from our  work. As one woman said, "too often, it  is women and children last."  continued on page 10 December/January 1982   Kinesis   7  EMPLOYMENT  Women working — myth vs. reality  The following is a summary of "A Response  to the Report of the Task Force on Labour  Market Development in the '80s" by Jeanne  Greatbach for Vancouver Status of Women.  The brief critiques the lack of opportunities and obstacles facing Canadian  working women.  In July 1981, the federal department of  Employment and Immigration released the  report of the Task Force on Labour Market  Development in the 1980s.  The Task Force was established to project  labour market conditions in the coming  decade; to assess federal employment  clerical worker earns just 65.7%  of the  wage paid to a male clerical worker, despite the,fact that women account for 78%  of all clerical workers.  Not only are women paid less for their  labour, but they lack job security. During  International Women's Year, Inco's Sudbury  plant hired 300 women. When layoffs hit,  these women were the first to go.  Women form 40.5% of the workforce. Yet  they make up 45% of the unemployed. And  statistics show that women are unemployed  for longer periods than men are.  Another myth is that women are fast leav-  I Vyjv* flo w\o«e>y W on  abortion ood Vm qcwewwi#it  \*>n'4 ofovide ofle •£*■ tie,  S>o 1 W a cV^ild I covmo+  a( W.  policies, training programs and placement services; to examine the problems  facing women and Native people In the job  market, and to evaluate the role of  federal job creation programs.  The final recommendations of the Ta 'dc Force  were tabled in October, 1981, in a report  called Work For Tomorrow.  Women and minority groups were supposed to  be a major focal point for the Task Force.  Although the severe economic conditions  of women are mentioned, no analysis of  their causes is detailed. The recommenda-  tf=5»  X oro a\So forced  \o accept sefcvAal,  YtoraiStvieM V>v -foe  \N©rK \t\ot6&r\o  keep mrj "job.  tions in Work for Tomorrow will do little  to alleviate the economic hardship facing  women.  To fill this gap, we have provided our own  analysis of women working outside the home.  Through this, we can better understand what  policies are needed to lower the barriers  preventing women from entering the main-  str<-vi labour market in Canada.  The microchip takes over  The myth that women now get paid as much  as men for work of comparable value —  or even for substantially similar work —  must be laid to rest once and for all.  While the wage gap is closing, albeit  slowly, a typical woman's annual pay packet  is thousands of dollars slimmer than her  male counterpart's.  The gap exists in all  occupations, including those thought of as  "women's work," where women have seniority  and expertise.  Look at the clerical field, where we find  the highest concentration of women workers.  Today, and a decade ago, the average woman  Recife is Wgel>/ uA<waitoV?le,  so 1 aA\ ^e>itt\\ed {com  vgorKina.  ing underpaid "pink collar" work for  well-paying, non-traditional jobs such as  carpentry, welding and electronics.  On the contrary, statistics show that  women are increasingly concentrated in low  paid, insecure, non-union occuapations:  62% of women working outside the home are  in clerical, retail sales and service  occupations.  This percentage has risen  from 50% a decade ago.  Also frightening is the prediction that  thousands of clerical, sales and service  jobs will be eliminated in the next decade  This unquestioning acceptance of shrinking  social service sector indicates lack of  foresight as well as lack of concern for  users of such services and those who staff  them.  Then there's the myth that the overall  economic situation for Canadian women is  improving.  In fact, the position of women workers in  Canada is worsening rapidly. Decisive  steps must be taken by federal and provincial governments to prevent thousands of  jobs being lost through technological  change.  The only way to prevent massive  So r jiess if wo/ten  hewevtf reacted economic  paoty «i+W men^Vwe!*  ncrtfcind fan can fee  dene aVwuV ir.  thanks to computerization — the so-called  microchip revolution.  Women in management don't fare much better.  -While the number of women in managerial  and administrative positions increased to  28% in 1981 from just 15% ten years ago,  still only 5% of working women are managers.  Another fairytale is that women employed  by government departments are better  treated than women in private industry  jobs.  The reality is that public employers  view women as a disposable workforce.  About 10% of Canadian women now work for  one level or another of government; but  cuts in social service budgets mean fewer  jobs for women as schools, hospitals and  other public institutions shrink and community agencies close their doors.  The Task Force predicts that the social  service sector will continue to shrink in  the coming decade. But its atrophy is not,  as the Task Force claims, due to demographic factors, but because of government  policy.  If I do wwwtoe fa  x* (c, Xat» paid .5<J  &ff\, vMV> ney-r -h>  v\o V\ope t>f pohoWcm  dislocation is through retraining programs  and an expanded social service sector.  To change the situation, we must be aware  of the barriers keeping women out of the  mainstream labour force. (We define "mainstream" jobs as those which provide a  reasonably secure future and pay in line  with the national average paid to male  workers).  The first barrier is employer discrimination. While the Task Force mentions this  factor, termed "systemic discrimination",  and cites the tiny number of women in  management as proof of its existence, the  report simplistically states that women's  own traditional views are the cause.  hard ct)cuc)W .  We believe that employers have used and  continue to use women as a source of  cheap labour, falling back on the excuse  that women's traditional views are to  blame for their low status. Wage discrimination has existed with the blessing  of governments.  The Task Force report suggests that  affirmative action programs be encouraged  by the federal government. We submit  that unless such programs are mandatory,  their effect will remain miniscule.  So far, Employment and Immigration's  voluntary affirmative action program  has interested only 26 firms in Canada,  none of which have implemented a plan.  Too, the report makes no mention of the  role of trade unions in any affirmative  action program. If trade unions are not  consulted and included, the resulting  hostility on the part of (largely male)  union members will scuttle any such  scheme.  A second barrier is socialization. As the  National Council on Welfare points out   continued on page 8 8    Kinesis    December/January 19!  EMPLOYMENT  WOMEN WORKING continued from page 7  in Women and Poverty, "Fifteen years  talk about equal opportunity for women  seem to have brought about little  change in the way girls and boys are  brought up." Children are sex-typed from  birth by their parents, and sex roles are  reinforced by the media. The schools  finish off the job, with textbooks showing women as passive, weak, housebound,  creatures supported by men with exciting  jobs outside the home.  When girls are taught from birth that they  are weak, that they shouldn't worry  about supporting themselves financially  and that marriage should be their only  goal, how can government agencies expect  women to overcome years of conditioning  and jump into non-traditional occupations?  Women need professional counsellors  trained to help them realize their potential and persevere in the face of sexual  harassment and discrimination.  Task Force recommendations in this respect  are well taken, as is a recommendation  for a national advertising campaign to  attract women into non-traditional jobs.  A third barrier is education unrelated to  the job market.  Canadian schoolgirls  usually restrict their high school and  post-secondary education to academic and  clerical courses. The fact that only  16.3% cf workers in engineering and  natural science professions are women  illustrates this tendency.  Funding for universities is in no way  tied to encouraging women to enter fields  such as engineering, forestry, law and  architecture.  In fact, university administrators continue to condone the sexist  actions of students and faculty which  deter women from entering these fields,  particularly applied science.  If women are to enter the mainstream  labour market, they must be prepared by  the education system for jobs as skilled  tradespeople and technicians .  The  federal government should reward universities who set and meet a target of 50%  female enrolment in science courses through  special grants and research contracts.  A fourth barrier is the cost of retraining  programs. Most working women, employed in  low-paid jobs, cannot save money to return  to school for full-time retraining. Single  mothers especially are at a financial  disadvantage.  Thanks to a handful of dedicated and  sympathetic counsellors, the Canada Man  power Training Program (CMTP) has been an  important vehicle for women in this regard,  helping them to train as welders, drafts-  persons, machinery maintenance workers and  for other non-traditional jobs.  But the CMTP is being dismantled (see  article on page 6) and the number of  places for Manpower-sponsored students  drastically cut.  Employment and Immigration will no longer support trainees in  pre-apprenticeship programs, and skills-  upgrading programs in language and general  academic subjects (BTSD) have been cut.  Five thousand B.C. trainees, who would  have qualified last year, will be unable  to get Manpower sponsorship this year.  Task Force recommendations  The Task Force places no onus on the  federal government to fund and coordinate  retraining programs for women. We feel  that, given the poor record of large corporations in training programs, the tax  incentive method for financing training is  not the best.  All education, including on-the-job  training and apprenticeships, should be  financed out of general tax revenues.  In  order to do this, general corporate taxes  must be increased, but according to the  Task Force, it is the large corporations  who have been getting a free ride when it  comes to paying for training.  As well, women must be appointed to the  provincial apprenticeship boards, which  rule on entrance requirements for apprenticeships. At present, women seeking  entrance to these programs must have  applicable prior work and educational  experience.  Qualifications must be altered so a woman's aptitute will count.  A fifth barrier is lack of support services for working women. The Task Force  recognizes that women workers are a  "special needs group" but unfortunately  provision of services does not automatically follow recognition of need.  Government outreach programs have been an  attempt to serve women's special needs.  But these programs have been hounded by  budget cuts since their inception.  In  addition, Outreach counsellors have continued streaming women into low-paid  "pink collar" jobs: as late as 1979-80,  70% of women in Manpower training programs  were in clerical and service courses.  We endorse the Task Force's recommendation  that counsellors be evaluated differently,  r  Canadian  Advisory Council  on the Status  of Women  f^^^      Conseil consultatif  ^B         canadien  L^   ^A      de la situation  _  _      de la femme  \  Publications  PENSION REFORM  WITH WOMEN IN MIND  LES FEMMES ET LA REFORME DES  REGIMES DE PENSIONS  Describes the Canadian pension  system and emphasizes women's  needs with suggestions for concrete  and realistic reforms that will provide  fair and adequate pensions to all  women.

Childcare is another service sadly lacking  for working mothers.  In B.C. today, there  is just one daycare space for every 18  children. And a B.C. Federation of Labour  survey shows that hundreds of women have  been forced to turn down promotions because of a dearth of daycare.  The Task Force took little note of this  problem, referring to it only in passing  and neglecting an opportunity to urge the  federal government to investigate the  feasibility of childcare centres at the  workplace, on the European model.  We find it incredible that the Task Force  ignored the need for childcare; it is a  must before women can take an equal place  in the labour forcel Without action on  this front, other recommendations will be  meaningless.  Sexual harassment is another threat to  working women that was completely ignored  by the Task Force.  In a 1978 survey by  the B.C. Federation of Labour, women  identified seven types of harassment:  display of nude or suggestive pictures of  women; staring at breasts or hips; derogatory or demeaning remarks: sexual remarks; touching; requests for dates in  return for job benefits; threats in retaliation for refusal of sexual favours.  Victims of these attacks feel powerless  because there is no avenue for formal  complaint.  Fear of harassment serves to  dissuade many women from entering the  workforce, and many other women from moving  into non-traditional jobs.  We submit that sexual harassment by engineering students at the University of B.C.  is the leason that female enrolment in the  department has increased to just 5% (from  1% in 1970) despite dramatic increases in  the numbers of women entering forestry,  commerce and medicine.  Legislation to outlaw sexual harassment by  employers and educational institutions  is badly needed to ensure women are not  prevented from entering highly paid occupations and professions.  We concur with the following recommendations, advising the federal government to:  • encourage re-examination of public policy  with regard to flexible retirement, part-  time work and work-sharing;  • step up on government affirmative action  programs as an example to private industry;  • train women, Natives, minorities and the  handicapped in order to make the best  possible use of Canada's labour resources;  • help community colleges, CEGEPs and technical institutes in the purchase of  modern machinery and equipment for up-to-  date instruction;  • encourage young people, especially young  women, to consider careers in engineering;  • adopt a ten-year National Right to Read  program to erase functional illiteracy;  • increase financing of pre-trades, job  readiness and job orientation training;  • update and expand apprenticeship programs, and make entrance requirements  more flexible;  • institute a system of contract compliance  for government orders which would give  preference to companies with approved  training programs;  • allow greater flexibility in unemployment insurance benefits;  • increase training programs aimed at  clerical workers who may be displaced by  technological change.  Q December/January 1982   Kinesis   9  HUMAN RIGHTS  Another chapter in the B.C. human rights drama  by Mary Woo Sims  On October 1, 1981, the former Director of  the Human Rights Branch, Nola Landucci,  was given approximately $30,000 (including  holiday pay, and benefits) as settlement  for her abrupt departure from that post.  Jack Heinrich, Minister of Labour, still  refused to state the reasons for her dismissal, saying only that "they came to a  meeting of minds."  Now that this episode in the drama at the  Human Rights Branch is over with, a new  chapter begins.  This chapter starts with the appointment  of a new chairperson and two new commissioners to the"B.C. Human Rights Commission.  On November 16, Jack Heinrich  named Dr. Charles Paris of Vancouver as the  new Chairperson of the Commission.  Dr.  Paris has extensive experience in the  human rights field, is currently on the  board of the Immigrant Services Society,  and was the regional director of the  Canadian Council of Christians and Jews.  The two new members of the Commission are  Renate Shearer, a lecturer in the UBC  School of Social Work, and Bijou Kartha,  a founding member of the Committee for  Racial Justice.  This brings the number of  commissioners to four, compared to the  former commission of twelve.  It has been over two months since B.C. has  nad a working Human Rights Commission and  it is my hope that this new commission will  continue the work of the old Commission and  press for changes to the Human Rights Code.  Commission needs authority,  responsibility  It is important to remember that as the  Code currently exists, the Director of the  Human Rights Branch can only make a report  to the Minister of Labour regarding an  unsettled complaint.  The power to refer  an unsettled complaint to a Board of  Inquiry rests entirely with the Minister.  One of the recommendations for changes to  the Code addresses this issue by recommending that:  "A single integrated Human Rights Commission be established with authority and  responsibility to inquire into and investigate complaints under the Code, and to  make reviewable decisions, giving reasons,  on their appropriate disposition.  These  powers would include power to dismiss a  complaint if it is unfounded, power to  approve a settlement if an appropriate  remedy has been made, and power to refer  an unsettled complaint to a Board of  Inquiry for a public hearing."  The advantages of having a Commission decide on cases rather than the Minister is  that hopefully, Commission members arc  better informed on human rights issues  and principles than the current Minister  of Labour seems to be. As well, the  possibility of political affiliations  interfering with the Minister's decisions  on the appointment of Boards of Inquiry  is reduced considerably.  I can not stress enough the importance of  the recommended changes to the Code.  The  July/August KINESIS carried an article  "Landucci's gone, but human rights concerns continue" which identified those  changes and the reasons we must act.  Time now to appoint Director  Now that we have a working Human Rights  Commission, I would like to see the  appointment of a Director of the Human  Rights Branch. As some of you may recall,  when Kathleen Ruff resigned in 1979, it  took the Social Credit government eight  months to replace her.  During that time,  the acting director, Maurice Guilbault,  did an admirable job. We currently have  another acting director, Hanne Jensen,  who is managing the job well.  Nicaragua: lessons from  a strong people  As Nicaragua moves into its third year of  freedom from the 40-year Somoza family  dictatorship, the country faces many difficulties — an unfriendly U.S. government,  the tragic civil war in Ex Salvador, border raids from Honduras by ex-members of  Anastasio Somora's National Guard, attacks  on the Sandinista government by disaffected  representatives of the private sector, a  highly critical western press, threats of  an economic block; ■ d o.  Nevertheless, the Nicaraguan people are  meeting these challenges with courage and  determination.  The Sandinistas have  accomplished a great deal since they took  power on July 19th, 1979.  AMNLAE, the Nicaraguan Women's Association,  continues to play a strong part in supporting and carrying on the work of the  National Government of Reconstruction.  It provides its 45,000+ members with con  tinuing education, the development of  professional skills (in the fields of  agriculture, health and administration in  particular), and general educational  programs through seminars, cultural  centres, schools and publications.  The organization is also encouraging the  government to establish day-cares, child  development centres, schools, community  kitchens, laundries and dispensaries to  alleviate the burden of domestic labour  in the household.  The national focus in 1981 has been health,  and AMNLAE is the key organization involved in planning and implementing programs.  Women are being '.".rained as  health "brigadistas" to take basic health  care into the remotest areas of the  country.  They have conducted two successful national vaccination campaigns and  have organized a number of national  "health education" days.  Nicaraguan women fought in the civil war  in unprecedented numbers; their participation in the reconstruction of their  country has been no less active.  Both Guilbault and Jensen come from within  the Human Rights Branch.  It seems only  logical that the position of the director  of the Human Rights Branch should go to  someone who has had considerable experience in the B.C. human rights scene.  I hope the minister considers this when  making his choice for the position.  The Social Credit government has indicated that its commitment to human rights  may be changing. However, that was due to  political pressure from the NDP and human  rights activists, including readers of  KINESIS.  Let us not forget that political action  must continue in order for constructive  action to continue.  There should be no  illusion that all is well with human  rights in B.C.  Please keep up the letters to MLAs and  Jack Heinrich, Minister of Labour, regarding the recommendations for change to the  Human Rights Code. 0_  Kinesis rates  are going  up . .  There's no easy way to break bad news,  so we'll 'out with it'.  Effective March 1, 1982 individual subscription rates to Kinesis will rise  to $13/year (or what you can afford)  from the current $10. Insitutional subs  will rise to $40, and sustainer subs  will rise to $75. The news stand price  will go to $1 (up from 75 cents).  The price increase is necessary not  only because of rising printing and  production costs, but because postal  rates are doubling (yes, doubling!)  on January 1. We are delaying our own  rate Increase until March to give you  a chance to renew now, before rates  go up.  Finally, in response to the many complaints we receive about poor mail  service, we want to assure you we are  doing our best to speed delivery.  We are attempting, once again, to get  a mailing permit and we have (as promised) been working hard to get Kinesis out by the 1st of each month. But  once it goes to the Post Office, we  can do nothing to hurry it along.  Please understand this.  We are doing seme much-needed long  range planning this winter, and will  let you know what comes out of that.  In the meantime, thanks for supporting Kinesis!  Margaret Randall, an American currently  living in Managua, says: "I'd say that  people all over the world interested in  the real emancipation of women should keep  their eyes on Nicaragua.  I think that  we're going to learn a lot of lessons in  the next few years.  Lessons about how  women's involvement in struggle effectively  and concretely changes their position in  society ... Nicaragua really isn't that  different from our own culture. Women  will be able to see how it works here,  how women become stronger and more  independent . . .."  Q from Oxfam 10    Kinesis    December/January 1982  NON-VIOLENCE  BCOFR rally raises questions about the use of violence  by Dorrie Brannock  On October 17, the B.C. Organization to  Fight Racism (BCOFR) organized a demonstration to fight racism.  Three weeks previously the BCOFR had organized a demonstration which was attacked  by the People's Front (a group fronted by  the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist  Leninist) — CPC (ML)) who beat up members of the BCOFR and landed one man in  hospital with very serious head injuries.  My reason for writing this article, and  asking questions, is that the BCOFR is a  group that has worked hard in the past  year to fight racism, and that feminists  have supported.  BCOFR is a group I support and want to  continue to support, but I don't agree  with the tactics they used on October 17.  I aii writing to solicit discussion on how  to handle violence and how to relate to  groups we support when they resort to  carrying weapons.  BCOFR responsive to racist attacks  The BCOFR is a group that has support from  women's groups. The CPC(ML) has never  received support from any women's group I  am familiar with.  Both groups advertize themselves as groups  to fight racism. Both groups have a high  percentage of Indian men. (There is a  language problem I would like to acknowledge. The Indian men I refer to here are  Canadian men who are immigrants themselves  or whose ancestors came from India. )  The demonstrations both took place in South  Vancouver, a section of town where a high  percentage of Indian people live.  South Vancouver is where a young Indian man  was murdered recently; another was shot and  wounded by men in a passing car as he waited  for a bus.  The Ku Klux Klan, or people with their mentality, have made other violent attacks  against Indian families in Vancouver,  Burnaby and Richmond. Sometimes the attacks  have taken the form of bullets through a  family's windows; other times fire bombs  were thrown into homes.  The BCOFR has responded to these attacks by  fighting to have the KKK outlawed, by getting- a lot of grassroots support, by highlighting what is happening to them and by  organizing demonstrations.  What was gained by the use of violence?  The CPC(ML) is a group that I believe promotes violence, whose members have in the  past come to rallies and demonstrations  with the sole purpose of disrupting. For  reasons I won't go into here, this group  is more hostile and violent toward BCOFR  than they are towards other progressive  organizations.  So, in September, they beat up peaceful  BCOFR demonstrators with 2x2s. Several men  were injured; one had to have brain surgery.  The police made no arrests - why I don't  know. There were a lot of witnesses and  the event was filmed by TV crews.  Three weeks after this attack, the BCOFR  held the October 17 demonstration. This  time BCOFR marshalls came armed with 2x2s,  wearing hockey helmets. Again BCOFR members  were hurt. Demonstrators were told to keep  marching while BCOFR marshalls at the rear  "faced CPC(ML) supporters with their 2x2s.  Some members of the BCOFR say this demonstration was a success. One BCOFR member  told me It was a success because we got  from the park to the school, and showed the  CPC(ML) they could not stop us.  All the visible characters in the drama  were men, although there were lots of women  in the march. So what purpose did women  serve?  I think the demonstration was a disaster.  We made a fine show walking down Fraser  having to ask people on the sidewalk to go  into the stores because they were in danger of getting hurt.  What were people supposed to think, seeing  white men from BCOFR face Indian men with  sticks in their hands? Try to explain that  to the people on Fraser St. and at the same  time tell them this is a march against  racism.  And what did people who watch TV see? They  saw two groups of men with 2x2s fighting  each other, policemen and their cars, and  one woman helping a wounded man.  What was the purpose of the demonstration?  Was it really to fight racism, or was it to  show the CPC(ML) they could not push members of the BCOFR around?  What alternative did BCOFR have? What responsibility do organizers have to their  supporters? For example, if they are going  to carry weapons, should their supporters  be forewarned?  What was gained by having the demonstration?  And if anything was gained, was it worth  the price?  If a women's demonstration was attacked by  a group of women carrying 2x2s, would we  organize a demonstration three weeks later  and arm ourselves with weapons?  At this point in my life I want to be involved in nonviolent groups, and I want to  support other groups in North America who  are practising non-violent resistance.  We work in a non-violent movement  When I think about how many women, old and  young, are murdered or raped each year by  men in this country, and how women have  organized to fight violence against women,  I know that we have been working in a nonviolent movement for a long time.  Women have seldom resorted to violence,  even though a lot of us have suffered all  kinds of beatings and humiliation on a  daily basis.  Individual women who have been driven to  the breaking point have sometimes resorted  to killing their tormenters, and when they  do I support them. There is a difference  between a group organizing to carry weapons I  and the individual who snaps under pressure.!  I see what part women in North America can  play in a non-violent movement. I can't  see how resorting to violence can benefit  women.  Nor can I see how participating in a demonstration against racism where our allied  brothers are armed against men who experience the racism we are demonstrating  against, can help rid this society of  VICTIM ASSISTANCE continued from page 6-  2. We don't need to expand voluntarism in  services by and for women (a stated goal  of the organization). Already, most of  our work as women is done for "no pay or  low pay."  3. What will happen in such an organization when conflicts arise between what is  good for other victim services and what is  needed by women? For example, the issue  of diversion within the justice system is  seen as progressive by most of those working in other services for victims, but not  necessarily by many of us working with  battered women. Who will lose when such  conflicts arise?  4. The first task proposed was the organization of a clearing house on victim  assistance. However, a clearing house on  domestic violence is already being developed, in addition to the networks being  developed by those of us working for  battered women and sexual assault victims.  5. We need whatever resources we can get  to carry on our work on these two issues,  work that is developed from the ground up.  6. The co-ordinating committee that organized the conference (and proposed to continue work on a national organization) was  representative only of Ontario and Quebec.  7. The participants of the conference  were there not only as individuals but  often as representatives of organizations.  Many of us were not prepared to vote on a  proposal which our organizations had not  had a chance to discuss.  For all these reasons (and perhaps others)  the proposal was rejected. The conference  did agree on the usefulness of information  sharing on a regional basis (including  perhaps, regional conferences). A contact  list of Canadian participants will be circulated soon.  It is unlikely, however, that the idea of  a general victim assistance organization  is permanently dismissed.  It will be important for those of us working in services  for battered women and sexual assault victims to co-ordinate our response to any  ■ future proposal.  Q December/ January 1982    Kinesis    11  NON-VIOLENCE  Violence and self-defense: time for a feminist dialogue  by Kristin Penn  The opinions expressed in this article are  strictly my own,  and d.o not reflect the  position of any group I may be involved  I went to the B.C. Organization to Fight  Racism (BCOFR) rally on October 17, and  was disturbed to see BCOFR marshalls  carrying 2x2 pieces of lumber as "self-  defence" against CPC(ML) agitators. What  I found even more disturbing was the number of feminists who considered the march  a "success" and who accepted the use of  2x2s as an inevitable necessity. One  woman compared the situation to the  Philippines and Chile, saying that when  the enemy arms themselves, we must also  arm ourselves.  The rally and discussions I had afterwards brought into focus the issue of  violence.  I would like us as feminists  to seriously examine and begin a dialogue  on this issue.  I think it is important to question the  assumption we must inevitably arm ourselves. We must consider what kind of  society we want to build and if that  kind of change can be brought about  through the use of violence.  Some might decide we must meet violence  with violence, but I hope those who reach  that conclusion do so only after agonizing  introspection and with profound reluctance.  I believe we must begin to change the future non-violently within ourselves,  within our relationships to others, and  within our political work, or we will have  no future to change.  The question often arises, "What about El  Salvador? What about Chile and South  Africa?" At the risk of sounding contradictory, I think that it is important to  actively support oppressed people who,  through armed struggle, are fighting for  their liberation and self-determination.  But we need not offer our support unconditionally or without question of methods  that groups may choose to use.  Take, for example, the film "Women in  Arms" (about Nicaraguan women's participation in the Sandinista army).  I was not  heartened to hear women discussing what  kind of guns they prefer, nor did I think  it liberating for women to kill next to  their male comrades.  Now that the war is over, women are being  phased out of the army.  Toward the end  of the film, a Sandinista officer commented: "women are even prettier when they  are fighting." No, I am not enthusiastic  about the participation of women in war.  The issue of violence is a complex one.  It is the quintessence of "the personal  is political", because we must all examine  our own potential for violence as well as  deciding whether violence should be used  as a means for social and political change.  Confronting violence in daily life  I have wrestled with the issue for many  years. My first political awareness and  involvement was in the civil rights movement in 1964.  I was inspired by the  commitment to non-violence and the  courage of those carrying it out.  In  1966 I joined Students for a Democratic  Society (SDS) and shared their belief in  the principle of "participatory democracy." In my idealism, I thought good  will and hard work would radically transform the very structure of American  society in a matter of years.  By 1967 I had become a Marxist and rather  easily accepted the necessity and inevitability of violence to make the  socialist revolution.  But I became disillusioned with the male-dominated left.  Though I remained anti-capitalist, anti-  imperialist, and maintained involvement  in the anti-war movement, I didn't know  where we were going and how we were going  to get there.  rl7W83  / believe we must begin to change the  future non-violently, within ourselves,  within our relationships to others, and  within our political work, or we will  have no future to change.  After becoming a feminist in 1972, I  seriously questioned whether the kind of  society I wanted to build could actualize  itself through violence. I concluded it  was not possible, because the process of  change is as important as the final goal.  But after visiting some feminist friends  in Boston in 1976, all of whom had become  Marxist-Leninists, I was again confronted  with the issue. My friends had found in  Marxism-Leninism a method, the only  method, that seemed practical to them.  Other ways seemed too unrealistic,  idealistic, vague.  It was becoming increasingly common at  that time for American feminist women to  become involved in left groups. Feminism  was not providing the solutions some  women were looking for. My friends said  they did not look forward to using  violence, but when it happened, they  would have to arm themselves in self-  defence.  Somewhat reassured by that perspective on  violence (i.e. self-defence), I spent the  next couple of years re-acquainting myself with Marxism and reading about  current liberation struggles.  But travelling in Europe and Asia turned  my "head around once again.  There I  experienced violence on many levels.  There is plenty of violence in our own  culture, but we can become numb to the  familiar.  The intensity of travelling  in cultures different from my own  heightened my awareness of the violence  both outside and inside myself. And in  many places, the violence was simply  more overt.  In Bulgaria I witnessed the violation of  the spirit when I stayed with people from  the "yoga underground" in Sophia.  Though  the government accepts physical yoga, the  spiritual aspects are completely suppres  sed.  The people I met there had to smuggle in  books, translate them from English to  Bulgarian, and pass the information  secretly from person to person.  They did  this knowing that their activities could  result in arrest and imprisonment.  I travelled through Iran in revolution,  where I was repeatedly harassed, abused  and hit in the streets for being a  western woman.  Iranian communists were  saying "the Islamic revolution is not  incompatible with communism." It was  incompatible with the liberation of women,  and it was no surprise to me that the  oppression of women intensified when  Khomeini took power.  In Afganistan, I was saddened and angry to  see Soviet tanks begin to move in. A  communist coup had recently overthrown the  government and had started to impose the  "revolution" from above.  The changes happening in Afganistan, many  of which were positive, were not, however,  brought about by an indigenous uprising.  It became obvious with the next coup, and  subsequent Soviet invasion, that the Afgani  people were being subjugated through force  rather than determining their own destiny.  In Pakistan I experienced a level of  violence more immediate to me. A man my  friend and I had been travelling with for  four days raped a woman who had recently  joined us. I went to the police station  with her to report the rape. That night,  a policeman and the hotel desk clerk  slept outside our doors with guns to protect us from possible retaliation.  In India, where I spent two months, it  seemed at times that violence could erupt  anywhere — on a crowded bus, in the  street, or temples. 'It was there I had  to confront my rage and capacity for  violence.  I studied Gandhi's concept of satyagraha  (soul force) and its application to  political work, as well as the Hindu concept of ahimsa (non-violence).  I pondered  how I could incorporate these into my  personal life, and visited Gandhi's ashram  and other memorials hoping to find the  answers I was looking for.  Taking responsibility for our actions  In Thailand, I reached a low point in  terms of personal violence. After a year  of hard travelling, my friend and I got  into an argument with a fruit vendor which  ended in a physical fight — over what  amounted to about one penny.  I felt a  deep sense of shame and confusion.  When I was in Thailand, Vietnam invaded  Cambodia.  Thousands of refugees fleeing  both Pol Pot's forces and the Vietnamese  were flooding across the Thai border,  only to be turned back to an uncertain  fate.  Pol Pot's legacy of destruction in the  name of revolution is a horror story that  defies imagination, but I questioned the  right of the Vietamese to impose their  plan on the Cambodian people.  Soon after that, China invaded Vietnam. A  tremendous depression overcame me as I  despaired at our human capacity to do  violence to one another.  Since returning from Asia, I have continued to explore non-violence.  Involvement  in anti-nuclear work has brought me an  increasing sense of urgency around this  issue.  I am acutely aware of our capacity  to destroy the world fifteen times over  with our current stockpile of nuclear  weapons.  I say "our" capacity to destroy because I  believe that I too must take some responsibility for the situation we humans have  created and perpetuated.  continued on page 12 12    Kinesis    December/ January 1982  NUCLEAR POWER  Diablo Canyon blockade: an exercise in mass resistance  by Diane Morrison  It wasn't enough that Three Mile Island  showed the world the uncontrollable dangers  involved in nuclear power.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is  prepared to license a plant that lies not  more than two and a half miles from a  major active earthquake fault in central  California — Pacific Gas & Electric's  Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.  Now every diligent protester knows that  even several thousand blockaders don't  stand much of a chance in physically stopping a plant's operations. But in the true  spirit of non-violent action, they can  bring the public's attention to a serious  threat to life.  The Abalone Alliance, a state-wide alliance  began to plan the Diablo Canyon Blockade in  1978. They worked extremely hard to ensure  non-violent discipline from its ranks. All  participants had to agree to follow a code  of non-violence and blockaders were required  to take a six-hour training session in  non-violent direct action.  Abalone was open with the law from the beginning, letting deputies sit in on strategy sessions. Unfortunately, these measures  didn't prevent painful arm locks, some broken wrists and general roughing up of the  blockaders by some law enforcement officers.  Day 1 of the 13-day blockade saw half the  two thousand participants bar all five  gates to the plant by mid-afternoon. These  were cleared by mid-evening with five  hundred blockaders arrested.  During Day 2, there was a five-hour delay  in work when blockaders .sat in front of  buses bringing in workers. This was the  closest the Alliance came to actually stopping the plant's operations.  The Diablo Canyon Blockade was a great  success, in human as well as political  terms. When the Alliance was running low  on support because so many had been arrested  four thousand local residents marched in  support near the main gate. The level of  organization, good media coverage, solidarity both in and out of jail, and non  violent action all re-inspired the concepts  of community and empowerment.  During the second week of the blockade,  Governor Brown filed suit against the NRC  decision to license the plant for testing.  In .addition, three of the five commissioners  expressed concern about the plant's safety.  And the water quality control board extended its hearing two weeks to get better  answers from Pacific Gas and Electric before re-issuing their permit to discharge  toxic wastes from the plant into the cove.  On Monday, September 28 the blockade ended  with an attempted citizen's arrest of  Pacific Gas & Electric representatives for  grand larceny of the ratepayers and contempt of life.  Hours after the blockade ended, the NRC  found the plant's earthquake safety calculations flawed and some of the piping  not up to blueprint standards. This will  involve major repair which will delay the  plant's operation indefinitely.  In all, 1901 members of the Abalone Alliance were arrested during the blockade.  From here, the Alliance plans to educate  and organize their local communities to  stop Diablo for good. Until they do so,  they vow, their battle will not be over.  (info from WIN)  VIOLENCE AND SELF-DEFENSE continued from page 11-  I find it increasingly difficult to focus  on the enemy without, while ignoring the  enemy within.  I believe we must struggle  on many fronts — confronting violence  within us as well as violence without.  Not too long ago, had someone said that  to me, I would have replied, "Don't give  me that individualistic crap! It's us v.  them, good v. bad, right v. wrong." Now,  what it means to me is that violent individuals cannot create a peaceful and just  society. We must work to change ourselves  as we work to change the world.  What I am saying can be misinterpreted,  so I want to be clear.  I am not  saying  that we are responsible for acts of  violence done to us, perpetuated by a  violent society.  I am    saying we are  responsible for acts of violence we do to  others.  We live in a society that violates us  daily, a society that perpetuates violence  rather than respect, domination rather  than co-operation.  It is not an easy task  to eliminate the multi-levels of violence  that confront us.  We must understand the kind of society we  want to build, and realize that the means  we use will affect the end we attain. If  we try to bring about change through force  and domination, we will find that we have  created another society in which force  and domination prevail. This is historically the case.  Only by bringing about change non-  violently, with respect for life in the  face of brutalizing destruction, will we  create a truly different reality.  This is unquestionably a monumental task,  one that requires a high level of cooperation, maturity and courage.  Perhaps we are not yet ready to meet this  challenge.  I personally am not prepared,  and it is with trepidation that I have  written this article, for I know I am  not living the reality that I suggest.  But it is still a goal that I strive for,  and one that I hope we, as feminists, will  strive for.  The building of the women's movement has  provided us a unique opportunity to  provide leadership in the non-violent  struggle.  Our goals have been to develop  co-operation, mutuality, power-sharing,  respect, collectivity and non-hierarchy  — just the values needed to develop a  workable non-violent strategy.  Though we  have by no means achieved our goals, we  are genuinely working to eliminate patterns of domination, oppression and inequality.  It is not easy to plan alternatives to  the use of violence.  To many, armed  struggle seems more practical than  peaceful resistance and offers quicker,  more certain results.  I have no illusions  that if we confront authority non-  violently, they will fight us peacefully.  Far from it — the revolution will  be  violent.  They will lash out with all the  fury and brutality at their command.  The  difference is we will not meet their  violence with violence. We will rely on  moral force and overwhelming numbers.  Many non-violent methods have been used  successfully, including civil disobedience, boycotts, strikes, draft resistance, fasts, sit-ins, and sabotage of  property.  Non-violence has not yet transformed a  whole society, but it has had tremendous  impact in specific situations like the  civil rights movement, anti-war work,  and India's independence from Great  Britain.  Currently, the demonstrations  of hundreds of thousands of Europeans  against the arms build-up and threat of  war is hav-ng an enormous effect on  public awareness.  We cannot dismiss the possibility of nonviolent transformation because it has not  yet happened. If we are not visionaries,  how will we begin to create the possibilities we imagine? 0 INCEST  SURVIVORS  SPEAK  wiim-  Incest has traditionally been defined as sexual intercourse between persons too closely related to marry legally (or safely,  as regards offspring).  This view of incest has for centuries provided an effective cover  for sexual abuse within the family.  Note the definition says  not a word about power imbalances.  Yet too many men assume they  have the right of sexual access to female members of their families.  We think that if the power imbalance between men and women is not  eliminated, then nothing can be done to stop incest.  Incest is, in fact, just one dimension of a larger problem called  female sexual slavery. It is thought of as happening in a few  isolated cases. We're discovering it to be rampant.  As Charlotte Vale Allen, author of Daddy's Girl,  has said, "There  are very few (places) where I've been interviewed where someone  hasn't come up to me and said, 'Me too.' "  What you are about to read in this feature will not be pleasant.  You may be shocked. And you may have a strong urge to disbelieve  the stories these women tell.  We're printing their stories because they have had the courage  to stand up and say what has gone on in their lives. In the  backs of our minds, we have known that incest, up to and including torture, is a part of our  culture. The stories we have been  told in the past year have only confirm our worst fears.  To stop incest we must look squarely at the truth as incest survivors have experienced it. Only then can we know what must be  done to stop the abuse.  The women who tell their stories here have taken the first step.  In defining themselves as survivors, rather than victims, they  show us that change is possible.  We want to emphasize that there is no time to be lost in confronting this abuse. As Kathleen Barry comments in Female Sexual  Slavery,   "Until public consciousness is mobilized and the terrorism of women is taken seriously, we will not have a world where  basic human freedoms belong to women as well as men."  — the Incest Survivors Collective  Bibliography  Armstrong, Louise.

It is not incest that is taboo, it is talking about it,  but it is time to get it out of the closet  and talk and talk, until somebody will  listen to what you are saying. It may  take a while, and even longer before  someone will help you deal with it.  I am an incest survivor. I am not completely over it because it will be with me  forever, but if you try you can win also,  and be a survivor.  I grew up in a small country town where I  worked along with my brother and sister  from a very early age.  Both my parents  have worked for as long as I can remember.  My father used to bath me as a child, and  my mother would bath my younger sister.  This is when it all started. For a few  years not too much else happened that I  can remember.  When I was seven I used to have to go out  on weekends and school holidays to work  in the country with my father.  The excuse  was to cook his meals and I would have to  stay out at night.  It was only with his finger at first. In  the tent he would strip off my clothes  and make my lie on the bed. He would play  with every part of my body, then he would  make me suck his cock. It was always  This meant dad could fuck me anytime he  wanted. All I had to do was do what I was  told. He would have his way anywhere, anyway he wanted, but not in front of anyone  except my sister.  Sometimes he would make  her join in.  One night while my mum was  away he made us both get into bed with him.  If he wanted a quickie, I would have to get  my pants off while he gave everyone else  something to do, then he would just jam it  in and do his thing. He would come in his  handkerchief for he had to be a little bit  careful.  The bedroom was not the usual place, they  were usually places like the bathroom, in  the middle of nowhere on a log or the hard  ground, on the truck seat, even in the  kitchen while I was doing the veggies for  dinner so that they would be done when my  mum got home from work.  When I realized that things weren't right,  that you weren't supposed to do it with  your father, I started to rebel.  But he  would love co do it more so I would fight  and this would get him more excited.  Then he started to belt me more often.  When I was twelve my average was only two  black eyes a year, and a black-and-blue  back and bum once a month.  But then things  went from bad to worse—it was four and six  black eyes a year, and black and blue  "Sexual abuse of children is permitted because it is an unspoken  but prominent factor in socializing and preparing the female to  accept a subordinate role; to feel guilty, ashamed, and to  tolerate, through fear, the power exercised over her by men . . .

Then he  would come, either on me or the ground.  As I grew older I started to enjoy this,  for I was not allowed to have boyfriends  and had no idea it was wrong. When I got  my period at the age of nine, he said I  was old enough to take his cock. (Until  this time he had either not put it in or  just the head. )  When I was ten my brother, sister, half-  brother (my father's son), and myself were  all playing house at home. My parents  weren't home. My brother hopped into bed  with my sister, and my half-brother hopped  into bed with me.  Now I didn't know anything was wrong with this as I had been  with my father for so long, but we did  have our underclothes on. Well, mum and  dad came home and we all dashed to get our  clothes on, for we were never allowed to  play.  There was always work to do.  Dad made me tell what had happened and I  told the truth.  I was the only one to be  punished. Dad sent everyone else outside,  then made my mum sit at the other end of  the table while he made me take my pants  off. We had to wear dresses for he said  he didn't like girls in trousers.  In front  of my mother he fondled my vagina, and then  put his middle finger right up my cunt.  All this time, my mother had to watch.  Everytime she went to say anything he told  her to shut up, and did it again. He did  it several times and that is how I lost  my virginity.  Then he told me to put my  pants on and not tell a soul or he would  kill me.  I would die of shame anyway, for  my mother told me later never to tell a  • -soul.   backside every two, three weeks.  I always  seemed to have marks on me.  I left school at fourteen, and started work  the Monday after I finished school. But I  still had to work nights and weekends for  my father so there was no way to get away.  Once every two months or so I used to stay  the weekend with a friend, but only 'cause  mum said I could go. My dad didn't want  me out of sight.  At the age of fifteen, my dad made me go  and get the pill so he wouldn't have to  worry. I had to tell mum, but when she  told dad he acted like he didn't know. He  then proceeded to lecture me about staying  away from boys. I was too young and didn't  have a boyfriend yet, and he would see  that I didn't have one for quite a while.  I left home at seventeen.  I felt guilty,  for my brother had left six months before  and my mum and sister were still at home.  But even though I had an apartment in town,  I was too afraid to stay there for the  first two weeks.  The day I left home he  had chased me with dogs and a gun just like  he had scared off all but one boyfriend I  had when I started work.  That Christmas he demanded I go to his  Christmas party from work. Seeing it was  Friday night and he had said I must go home  on Friday and Sunday nights, I went.  I sat beside my mum like a stone and my  dad brought me a beer. His boss asked my  sister and I if we would like to see the  house. We had a quick look at the house  and were sitting at the bar when in walked  our father.  He asked us what we were drinking.  I said  . ,rum .and coke,,, and, before, I could move he  had me by the hair and was dragging me  all the way home.  He tore my shoes off,  broke them both, tore my dress off me and  into shreds, then tore all my underwear  off.  I was standing in the kitchen naked  when my mum came in and convinced him to  allow me to put her robe on and an ice  pack on my face.  While I cleaned up my bleeding face and  tried to nurse some of the welts on my  legs, he made mum go up town and buy a 26  ounce bottle of rum, a large bottle of  coke and six bottles of beer. While he  drank the beer, I had to drink the rum.  He was pouring it and I drank the lot. He  had one beer to go when he went to sleep  at the end of the table. Mum took me home.  The next day I was so black-and-blue I  didn't want to leave the apartment. A  friend came over and when she saw me she  nearly had a fit. I saw dad coming so I  asked her to stay while he was there. By  now I knew I was never going to give in  to him i  My friend called the doctor but couldn't,  reach him.  So on Monday I went to work  in dark glasses, long sleeves and slacks  to cover the marks, using makeup to try  to cover some others. I went to the  doctor's from work. When he saw me, he  told dad (and later the police) that if  he ever touched me again he'd be in jail.  Things never did get much better.  He  "ould watch wherever I lived, but I would  not allow him in my house.  If he came  around when I wasn't there he would leave  an axe or something on the front step to  let me know he had been there.  I had nowhere to live at one stage and  moved home again for two months, but  things were looking really bad again, so  I made the decision to get out.  I considered the army, then applied for a  job in Canada and got it.  I left Australia  at the age of twenty.  I had been here for ten months before the  weight of carrying it around on my shoulders got too much for me. I was sitting  in my doctor's office and it all just  poured out. She listened, with no interruptions and that felt good.  She told me then of a group her friend  was hoping to start.  There would be other  women there with the same experience and  maybe we would help one another.  I went to that group for six months, I  yelled, screamed, beat a punching bag, and  busted my hands, got sick and cried a lot.  I got rid of a lot of emotion, and I wrote  a lot.  (One friendly word of advice: no matter  who you are, if you can't talk yet, try to  write about it, and start to work it out  of your system slowly.  Gradually you will  feel some of the tension go and you will  be able to talk about it then. )  I no longer go to the group, but keep in  touch with my social worker, doctor and  friends from the group.  I am one of the  lucky ones and no one is going to beat me  down.  I still write when I feel it is  necessary.  I have even told my boyfriend and he is  kind, thoughtful and tries to help me when  I need it.  I am not over it, even though for the first  time in ten years I can speak to my father  and not be angry at him. Maybe one day I  will be able to go back and face my father.  At the moment I feel very strong and he is  not so sure of himself. For the one time  I spoke with all my confidence, he made out  he couldn't hear me over the phone.

I've been silent strong and sturdy  I've been angry hateful and dirty  I've been guilty long enough  I've been abused many times over  I've been beaten  But now it's all over ,  My bones have mended  The scars erased  I'm open to loving not shit in my face  I'm here strong yet so tender  I'm tough yet so soft  Tread gently for my hurts are enough  Open your eyes see me for me  Erased is my shame  Over what's happened to me.  I sit here a person  Waiting for love  Not shit and abuse.  These are the words of a victim - me.  Once low enough to commit suicide, now  strong enough to live.  Going through life seeing me as dirt.  Guilty, ugly, sinful, hateful, wanting  nothing but death is how I've been.  Thursday I overdosed.  The pain was too  great, carrying a burden so full of hate.  My father abused me mentally, physically  and sexually. He caused my warped mind.  He made me feel like shit. For years now,  I've been running from a man - no me -  I  was my worst enemy. I carried the blame.  Incest is not only the invasion of a body  but of the mind and heart too. The scars  that come with it are carried only by me.  I condemn myself. Rot my insides. Run,  hide. I alone hate the one thing precious  - me.   I alone stand bared to the world -  a victim.  I hate deeply my father and my mother,for  they are to blame, but with them other  families and most of all society, for they  allow it to happen.  Worst of all though is me. For I condemn  myself far more tnan anyone else. I re- '  main silent. I get sick. I erase emotions.  I alone wept. I struggled to survive. I  ran in fear. I rotted my guts. I was my  worst enemy.   #  No more will I be a victim. A part of a  crime.  For I now am a survivor.     I've  been through the worst.  I now am out of  hell.  I now love myself.  I now can live.  Not alone, not uncaring, but alive - a  life full, happy and sharing. My rage is  not erased. My pains have not disappeared  and never will, but I now can go on.  For the first time in my life I care about  me.  Not what he did or why.  Not what  people think.  Not what society says. I  care  about me and I feel human.  Alive.  I am a person, not a thing anymore.  I am an incest survivor, not a victim!  Sorting out abuse is not simple for  young incest survivors  by Marg Verrall and Hope Naaykens  For the past five months Hope and I have  been running a group for girls six to thirteen years old. Most are incest survivors.  So many of them surfaced in one area that  a group was inevitable. They had been beaten up, threatened, molested or raped by  one or more members of the community -  outdoors in the playground, or indoors by  fathers, brothers, stepfathers, neighbours  or the teenager down the block.  In the group, they are able to meet other  girls who have had similar experiences.  The two greatest services we offer are the  chance to talk, and the chance to have  close friends who know about what has happened, and still accept them as a friend.  They have a lot of questions: Why is it  mostly men who do this to young girls? Why  don't they leave us alone? The girls are  extremely aware of the 18 kidnappings this  summer, and know they were mostly teenaged  women. They have seen flashers, and escaped  the hands of lecherous old"men. They are  still trying to recover from the feeling  that there is a man with a knife behind  every bush.  They were more than happy to learn the group  would include self-defense. It also includes  discussion circles, individual time with an  adult woman to talk indepth about what happened, roleplay of scenes from the past  (learning to say No, changing the endings),  time for artwork, bio-energetics and basic  breathing techniques.  It's one thing to talk about strangers molesting young girls. It's another to realize  that it was your father, or some male member  of your family. Often threats go along with  molesting and rape: "Say anything to anyone  and I'll kill you", "I'll do it to your  sister" or "I'll beat up your mother".  Incest starts young, and often involves  more than one member of the family. The  girls have gone through, horrifying experiences, and it is painful for them to remember the pain, and then to realize the  implications of what has happened.  All of them are relieved to be believed.  For most of them, incest lasted for two or  three years. It began when they were too  young to realize what was going on, apart  from irrational, terrifying threats or  equally confusing kindness.  At first, the older girls have a more difficult time talking than the younger ones,  because they feel responsible, dirty, reluctant to admit that something out of  the ordinary has happened to them. The  younger girls punch and kick, rage at the  pillows before they can sort out their  feelings.  Talk becomes easier as the group goes on  because they meet others who have similar  stories, and there is a chance to talk  about who you can tell at school, and who  you can't. They prepare themselves to talk  with other friends about abuse and incest;  not to feel as if they have done anything  wrong.  They review the times they have spoken  about what has gone on, and not been listened to. They don't always understand why  they were not listened to and believed,  but their lives change when it becomes  clear they are believed now.  Discussions are not simple. Remembering  can bring on stomach aches, anxious energy,  emotional pain. Those who are not talking  are often numb, and don't remember much of  what happened. Bits of information we know  and mention can bring it back. Conscious  diaphragm breathing and simple bioenergetic  exercises unlock the past. And learning  the importance of a sugar-free, healthy  diet can shift someone's self-concept. It  takes a while to remember and admit what  went on, and it takes a long time to feel  all right.  It was a 7-year-old who suggested drawing  instead of talking. When the drawings began, we could see an art form emerging that  had never been seen before. Graphic descriptions of sexual assaults. Hands all  over. Penises everywhere. Snakes and phallic trees, screams, small "No's" and big '  "Yes's". The words written out: My Daddy  and my brother touched me.  The girls don't realize what pioneers they  are. They are surprised when we tell them  they are among the first to be in such a  group. I am amazed at their bravery. Here  they are talking about what needs to change  in their world to make it better. "Teach  people not to be violent", "Teach fathers  not to do these things to their daughters".  All the girls in the group are safe right  now. Some of them are headed into court.  They ask us what happens there. "Does the  offender get counselling, is he charged  for what he did? Do the police keep me  safe? Does he go to jail? Will they believe  me if I tell them what happened? Do I have  to tell everything right in front of them?"  They want to be believed, and they want us  to take care of the rest, now that they  have talked. They want to feel safe, and  they want never to have it happen again.  They want to know what their chances are.  I find it difficult to answer them.  Moments from the group ...  I held a 6-year-old girl who rocked and  cried from stomach pains caused by the  memory of what her father did to her. She  clung to me as she described how her father  tried to put his penis into her.  A 9-year-old sobbed, "It was my fault...  tell me it wasn't my fault...it was  my  fault...my fault." She had trouble breathing, her father lay on top of her and she  thought she was being smothered when "it"  happened to her. She ran from the building  to try and escape from the thoughts of  sexual activity that was her fault.  A 12-year-old, who knows the number of days  and hours before the court case, finds it  hard to say what her father made her do  for three years. We talked of incest victims who were too scared to tell someone  or who had told and hadn't been believed.  She said they are "living in pain."  It has been heart-tugging to watch an 11-  year-old over the five months she has.been  meeting with other young girls who are  victims of sexual abuse from a male family  member. When she first came to the group  she spoke seldom and softly, she looked  down or had her face behind her hands, and  just listened.  She was removed from the offending parent  when she could talk, taken to a nourishing  home and has found real friends in the  group. Over the months, she has begun to  giggle, her face has" opened like a flower,  her eyes look up, make contact and sparkle.  She is just like a real little girl who now  has a chance to enjoy her childhood - if  her father and older brother can be kept  away from her.  We deserve to love ourselves  by Blu Peppas  My father first attacked my body when I  was 15 years old. He grabbed my breast. I  looked up in shock and backed away and he  told me not to tell my mother. He didn't  harass me against until two months later  when we moved to a new district of Ottawa.  My heart beats faster with the thought of  my father coming closer to me. The look in  his eyes showed me what was on his mind,  and I was shaking with fright.  He sat down, ordered me to sit beside him  and started to talk to me about his relationship with my mother. He told me he  was not happy sexually with her. She had  apparently cut him off of sex for five  years before.  Then he told me about going out and hiring  a prostitute. He told me details, like he  couldn't get his penis hard.  Also he had  problems masturbating, he couldn't get  hard at that time either. He told me he  was very frustrated sexually and I must  help.  I looked away in fear. I felt threatened  by him because his father image was overpowering. (It is like you must do as your  father says or else!) Again he told me  not to tell mom. He was really saying you  better not tell mom or you'll be in trouble.  I was forced to give him a hand job time  after time. It made my stomach sick and  I hated to see him come near me. He forced me to help him for eight months or so,  until he ran away from home. (He moved to  Vancouver and later we moved out here too.)  One week after we moved here he started to  harass me.  I turned to him and said "no  more, leave me alone".  I took control of  myself in that H  year separation from my  father.  But he still played sexual mind  games with me until I was 23 years old.  It took me this long to see it.  I never talked about this to anyone when  I was going through it. My mother has  found out but there is no support from her,  she battered me as a child too.  I don't  need them.  Now I'm 27 years old and have been involved  in an incest group for almost one year.  The group has helped me in dealing with my  sexual relationships, with myself and the  womyn in my life.  I'm grateful to be  dealing with it.  At first it was hard, but slowly, surely  it gets better. Just talking about it has  helped me to express my hurt and my anger.  We need to release that so- we can grow.  We deserve to love ourselves.  Power is in our knowledge of our own past.  —Judith McDaniel, Sinister Wisdom, Vol. 7. Kinesis    December/January 1982  INCEST  Somehow we live through the torture and survive  to tell our stories  by Sky  (Nancy Ruddy, Nancy Bredin)  For almost nine months last year I was part  of a women's support group for incest survivors. The group helped me accept the  chilling, horrifying, degrading and disgusting incest experiences I had throughout  my childhood and extending even after I was  married.  I had been in a bio-energetics group in  Toronto working through my inability to  fight back after I started divorce proceedings against a violent husband.  The first memory I had was being sexually  abused by my mother's boyfriend. Then I  remembered an uncle, then my father. The  terror and despair that surfaced forced me  to leave Toronto and seek out other women  who were incest survivors.  Only women with similar experiences could  hear me, could believe me, and could talk  about their own painful past so we could  heal ourselves together.  This group of strong, beautiful women helped  me to accept feeling helpless, victimized,  ashamed, frightened, little and invisible.  They helped me accept the horror not only  of being sexually abused from infancy on,  but of being the daughter of a hired killer.  At age eight, I saw my father murder his  mistress and her common-law husband when  she threatened to blackmail him. I was used  as a front, taken with him when he had a  contract on someone. He would also pick up  prostitutes, rape and then kill them,  usually by strangulation.  My father trained me to kill for him as  well. Drunk or drugged by my father most of  my years at home, I had no memory of any of  this until it surfaced while I was involved  in the group.  I needed the support of sensitive, caring  women to keep living, when I realized what  had been done to me.  My father took me to a brothel he owned in  Hull-Quebec where I was chained to the wall,  beaten and raped by him and his friends  (who were lawyers, judges, doctors, politicians, ministers, priests and bishops).  He gave us lessons on how to treat ministers, priests and bishops. We were taught  to act seductive so they wouldn't feel  guilty for being there. My father sat in  the living room of the brothel, surrounded  by me and other prostitutes, like a guru,  telling us our duty was to bring beauty to  this world by sharing our beauty with the  ugly, the slime, the underworld.  I was sometimes chained to the bed when he  went out. The chain was around my ankle, and  I was kept like a pet. When I remembered  this incident, chain marks appeared around  my ankles. I was given shock treatment when  I couldn't stand being there and would run  away and eventually be picked up by the  police. I was twelve then.  At thirteen, I was kept home from school  when my youngest sister was born to my  mother in hospital. My father tied me in  the basement and tortured and raped me  daily, but would bring me back upstairs and  put me to bed when my sister and brother  came home from school. (He had phoned the  school saying I was sick. )  My worst fear was that he would fall asleep  in a drunken stupur or pass out with a lit  cigarette and the house would burn down,  and they would find me tied to the wall.  I also have memories of him lining us all  (my mother, my sister, my brc'her and me)  up against the wall in the kitchen at gun  point, saying he hated us all and was going  ^o kill us. My mother had to do a strip act  to get him to stop.  He was a hunter and had lots of guns. Sometimes he would tie us all up to posts in  the basement and torture and rape us like  prisoners of war. For this scene he would  be naked and carrying a gun. I would tell  myself sometimes it was all a dream (that's  what I was told by my parents often), but  when the other children in the neighbourhood  would call us from outside I knew it wasn't  a dream.  Most of the time I would leave my body -  check out - black out because it was all  too much for my mind to accept - that someone who was supposed to love and care for  me could do these things to me.  After these scenarios, he would claim he  was just playing, saying it was all for  fun, and want to take us out for ice cream  cones. I wouldn't go.  My mother was beaten so badly by my father  I had a hard time believing she could live  through it. After beating her up he would  rape her until she vomited, then piss and  shit on her and say that's all she was good  for.  Sometimes when I got up in the morning I  would find her like that, lying on the kitchen floor, and I would be afraid she was  dead. I would try to clean her up before I  v;ent to school.  The world seemed overwhelmingly horrible to  me then. My father had been an officer in  the army and was t?ained in torture. Both  he and my ex-husband knew to hit us on the  side of the head where the temporal lobe of  the brain is situated. This part of the  brain controls sight and hearing and I-  consciousness. This made us lose sense of  ourselves, as well as impair our sight and  hearing.  For the past few years I've had memory recalls of a satanic quality to some of the  sexual encounters.  I remember being tied spreadeagle to my  parents' bed after I had been drugged. My  mother was drugged as well and acting  strange - dressed all in black. She set up  ritual candles on the dresser. They would  chant horrible sounds, become frenzied and  scream that the devil had entered them,  then rape me.  Two of my uncles were there too, my father's  sister's husband and my father's older  brother who was a doctor and head of the  mental hospital in Whitby, Ontario. They  both raped me as well.  I also remember being taken to the woods  blindfolded, where I was bound and tortured  A dead rotting rat, covered with maggots  .and ants, was put in my vagina and my mouth  On the eve of my thirteenth birthday, my  mother tried to kill me by giving me something that was poison. I remember hearing  her say in the morning to my father v/hon  I woke, that she had given me enough to  kill a horse.  That night, the light of my thirteenth  birthday, I was taken blindfolded to the  woods again, where I was initiated into  their Satan coven. They roastod rats and  force-fed me some and put a live starving  rat in my vagina. They held my vagina closed  so the rat died inside me. I could feel it  rnawing at my insides before I blanked out  and it died.  Then they tied me to a round wooden turntable and spun it around. A circle of men  surrounding me chanted and stomped around  the other way, forcing clouds of dust to  rise. I was raped by all thirteen men, like  spin the bottle.  I also remember being raped by my father-  in-law when I wasn't conforming. He raped  me on their dining room table when the  rest of the family were out of town. My  biggest fear was that neighbours might see  us. He chased me around the house with a  whip and forced me into the bathtub where  he pissed and shit on me.  When I threatened to tell my husband, he  told me they would not to] cerate scandal in  the family and I would be suffocated by  having a pillow held over my face some  night when I was asleep. He said a lot of  women die of heart attacks that way. (My  father had h^ld a pillow over my face when  he raped me early in the morning before he  went to work and I went to school, until  I learned not to scream or cry out.)  Another painful memory was when my sister's  husband raped me when I was visiting her.  She was pregnant at the time, hemorrhaging,  and bedridden. He raped me in the kitchen  when I went to make her tea. I was afraid  to scream out, afraid my sister would die.  His friend, there for the evening, raped me  too. When I remembered this incident, the  continued on page 19 December/January 1982    Kinesis    19  INCEST  Treatment of offenders: who is being protected?  by Marg Verrall  Incest no longer seems taboo. Instead it is  emerging as an entrenched part of our North  American culture.  The Katherine Brady Foundation states  there are 25 million incest victims in  America, and that 1.5 million go unreported annually. For reported cases, there  are counsellors trained to assist, faster  police intervention and widespread  attempts to treat the offenders.  An open attitude is essential  Last September I travelled to California  to meet with people working to stop incest.  I knew I would learn from their wealth of  knowledge, and wanted to know the difficulties encountered in a program slightly  ahead of our own.  I began with an adult women survivors group.  As a feminist I consider these women to be  the most valuable teachers we have.  Calls come in through a variety of agencies.  I was referred to The Women's Switchboard,  Battered Women's Association, Rape Crisis  Line, CASARC (Child and Adolescent Sexual  Abuse Resource Centre), Coleman Children  and Youth Services, Independent Counsellors  and an institution called Parents United.  Most counsellors I spoke with readily  stated their therapy is based on a feminist  approa ch.  We discussed approaches. For example, we  . ask automatically about sexual abuse at  intake. We do not assume it to be absent  if the client has no memory at present.  There are many reasons for blocking, and  things we can do to trigger memories.  Bodywork is important to prevent numbness.  We are prepared for self-hatred, confusion  and hopelessness, and encourage anger.  continued from page 18 ———-—^———  pain shot to the top of my head and I  could hardly move for days.  When I remembered my father raping me with  a knife held to my throat after I was  married (I had thought my life of bondage,  powerlessness, cruelty and victimization  was over), a red scar appeared on my left  arm from my elbow to my wrist, and welts  appeared on the inside of the tops of  my legs where he had beaten me years ago.  My father told me what we were doing was  bad so we had to keep it a secret. If no  one knew, it would be as if it never happened. He conspired with me against my  mother, and would put her down constantly.  She would not feed me for days after one of  the rape scenes - not cook enough, and then  say, you're not hungry anyway.  I am able to write and talk about my life  because I have been studying yoga for twelve  years, teaching for nine, studying and  teaching bio-energetics for seven, and been  adamant about being in women-only groups and  space. I have purified my diet and my life  as much as I can. I eat only fruit, vegetables, nuts and grains and drink only herbal tea or unsweetened juice. I also read  anything I can find on women's lives  The counsellors I met at Coleman Services   Assault Clinic offers groups only to those  and at CASARC were extremely helpful in  supplying material on how to help someone  come to terms with a past of rape.  Twenty-five to thirty cases"come into  CASARC each month. Of these, half are  inter-familial; 90% are girls, 10% boys.  CASARC provides crisis counselling, court  assistance, children's groups, and help  to community social workers.  They described the extensive (compared to  Canada's) program for offenders. Intervention by police is fast, on the whole.  One bone of contention is that Parents  United seems to have the most direct line  to police, with other social services  receiving a variety of responses from the  court system.  For me, it was new to hear so much about  treatment for offenders. The Seattle Sexual  offenders who are past the stage of denial.  All individual and group counselling is  backed by court order, the prevailing  theory being that without police intervention, therapy is not effective. The offender is made to look at his violence, and  how it connects to his sexual assaults.  All cases of incest must be reported, but  police treatment varies. In some areas,  they prefer to remain uninvolved. This make;  speaking up even more dangerous. If the man  is rich and influential, chances are the  victim will not be believed, thus giving  the offender 'carte blanche'. Many counsellors believe a normal child 'would have  told if it were true'. Mothers and sisters  are accused of lying when they do tell, and  blamed when they don't.  Children often retract statements out of  fear when immediate intervention does not  take place. Offending men rarely admit  fault. Just as victims are able to bury it,  offenders also convince themselves that  nothing happened, or believe in the right  to initiate their own daughters.  Misuse of power often leads to abuse  The power dynamics of rape and incest point  time and time again to men's hatred of the  pressures imposed by other men, mixed with  a sense of inadequacy and a fear and hatred  of women.  Most men appear innocent because they have  no previous record. Pillars of their communities, with rigid senses of right and  wrong, they usually value obedience from  children, and subordination from women.2  Men in positions of authority can be confident they will not be caught or charged,  continued on page 20  Freedom means no one is able to destroy you, enslave you,  paralyze you.  Diary of Anais Nin, Vol. 7  When women take positive steps to move out of patriarchal  space and time there is a surge of new life. Such women are no  longer empty receptacles to be used as "the other".  —Mary Daly, Beyond God The Father  I want in-  I tell you about my life because  cest stopped.  I tell you about my life so you who have  been sexually abused and had your experiences and pain denied, will know you are  not crazy!  Somehow we can live through horrendous tortures and survive. Survive to tell our stories and regain our power. Alone we are only  one voice, but together we are changing the  world into a place where women's pain is  believed and a place and time is made for  us to heal.  I tell you about my life because I won't  pretend any longer.  I tell you about my life because I want your  support in putting an end to the church of  satan. Victoria, B.C. has the second-largest  gathering of satan worshippers in the world.  There are five church of satan groups there.  We must stop them. And I want your support  if any of the people I have mentioned try to  silence me.  We of the incest survivors group still see  each other. We have gone through so much  together, felt near-death experiences, and  supported and cared for each other through  them. We developed a special kind of bond  that cuts through everything else, all the  barriers, all the man-made divisions. That  is stronger than any family I have known.  We were part of an hour-long video called  IT'S NOT INCEST THAT IS TABOO, IT'S TALKING  ABOUT IT. In it, we talk about our experiences, dealing with pain and anger and seeing how we have been kept isolated in our  pain. The video is being edited now and will  be available to the community soon.

December/January 1982  INCEST  continued from page 19  for they are in control of the laws. Some  men were sexually abused as children. Many  grew up in homes with violent fathers.  For more insight into problems that offender  programs encounter, I was referred to a  man who helped set up many of the first  offenders' groups, including some at Parents  United. He, like many other counsellors I  spoke to, has many complaints about the  treatment of offenders using the Parents  United model.  To the outside, it looks like a successful  program. Three hundred families a year use  the services at Parents United. Groups are  run for victims, offenders, mothers, and  other members of the family. Men and women  are placed in separate groups, and mothers  and daughters have eight weeks to sort out  what this man has done to them, before  reunification of the family begins.  Sounds good, on the surface. But eight weeks  isn't long, and here lies the problem. Parents United gets plenty of money from Washington, and the message is: keep the family together. The result is not child or  mother advocacy, but, once again, protection of the offender.  Board dominated by men, ex-offenders  If offenders co-operate with Offending  Specialists (connected to the Probation  Office), and with therapists in Parents  United, they can become an official within  the organization within two years. This  contradicts the recognized fact that successful therapy depends on power (particularly power over families) being taken out  of the hands of the offender.  At this point, offenders stay out of the  home for'a minimum of 18 months to two  years (some want this reduced to six  months). Seattle Sexual Assault Clinic  suggests that two to three years is enough.  Many ex-offenders have become officials  in Parents United, and mothers and daughters are all too aware of this. Mothers  are described on the whole, as feeling  censored, unable to develop any new sense  of power. One felt so fearful she would  stop talking to her counsellor whenever  one of these 'officials' passed in the  hall. She felt the parking lot was the  safest place to express her feelings.  Although Parents United was started by a  woman, the President and Vice-President  are now ex-offenders. The board is male-  dominated, seating very few women.  Of the 300 women in the program, eight  have split away to form their own group  as extra support. They do not want to stay  'parents united', even though they need  some of the services offered. They want  divorces. These women have been strong  enough to trust their own wishes in the  face of tradition.  Periodically, Parents United has a night  of presentations - the year in review.  The program, includes conventionally "pretty"  children giving testimony on stage, with  other children sitting in the audience.  On one occasion, a young teenaged girl  spoke about how, before she confronted an  offender, she wondered if she could ever  trust a man again, but now that she had  met this man, she knew it would be all  right. At this point, she flung herself  into his arms for a long embrance. They  were cheered on by the audience as a  success story.  JfSL^  ->  ^? r?)  t;  zs^cy-t  I      Mmwm  When reunification of the family and ability to relate to men are heralded as signs  of success, and vdien success is wanted  quickly, no real time is spent by mothers  and daughters regaining their footing or  shifting the power dynamics they are accustomed to with men. The result is the continuation of incest at rates higher than  most would like to admit.  School programs crack taboo open  Despite these problems, education in the  school system is expanding. The right to  private sex education by the family is  being cracked by the growing evidence that  one in ten families (a conservative estimate) are not safe places to be. Often as  many as four of thirty children will turn  up for private time with a counsellor,  immediately after a school presentation.  Incest is here, and it is not uncommon.  It has simply been suppressed through the  myth that women ask for what they get, and  lie to get back at men. Laws as far back  as ancient Rome recognized the presence of  incest, but penalized only incestuous marriages. In North America today, no individual can be sure of being believed and  protected by the court system.  Girls experiencing incest are of all ages,  from babies on up. Counsellors all over the  city have been seeking training. An adult  incest survivors group formed last year.  This year there are three, plus an adolescent women's group and a children's group.  Many more are needed.  Support groups are also needed for mothers  who feel paralyzed when incest is discovered. Many remember similar sexual abuse as  children; memories they had tucked away,  not knowing who to tell.  Children don't lie about incest  Social services are planning what to do in  the face of the awful realization that  countless women have been initiated into  •sex via rape. As children they were forced  to submit to fellatio, cunnilingus, manipulation and rape. When they tell their  stories, they are not always believed by  counsellors.  Even more often, they are disbelieved in  court. There is no provision for them to  give private testimony, away from the offender. If they are not strong enough to  say what happened in detail, in a court  room, at the age of seven, eight or nine,  in front of the offender, chances are  charges won't be pressed at all. If an  adult has not seen it happen, the judge may  decide there is insufficient evidence.  Experiments have shown that children don't  lie about incest, yet victims at times are  subjected to lie detector tests. Teenagers  who have left home and reported incest,  yet are unable to bring about intervention,  are left with the anguish that sisters are  still at home with the offender.  Worst of all is the lack of any extensive  program for offenders. Courts provide a  regular Probation Officer if the man is put  on probation, but no groups or 'offender  specialists'. Very few psychologists, psychiatrists or counsellors want to tackle  offending men's groups, let alone individual offenders.  Admittedly, it is not pleasant confronting  offenders, but it has to be done. A few  men are charged, but the majority are released after being identified.  The message to men is that they can get  away with it. The message to the rest of us  is that even when men are caught, there are  not many in Vancouver who are interested in  confronting them with what they have done.  Incest has been around for centuries, and  somehow it has been protected. During International Year of the Child, a very few  studies were funded to investigate abuse  in the home, yet incest is barely mentioned.  Today children still go to court to be told  the offender has been let off.  When will it stop? I believe it is changing  now because of those who are brave enough  We can no longer accept fear as a way of life — (From RAPE  by Carol V. Horos). We can no longer accept definitions of rape  as a sexual encounter — rape is a crime of hate and violence,  committed by a man who uses sex as a weapon to inflict violence  on his victim.  The children have their own groups. Teenaged girls in the program are provided an  opportunity to confront not their own  father, but another offending father. This  may have its therapeutic side, but it  also gives rise to the opportunity for  offenders to meet other young girls.  teenaged boys are raping their to ignore the threats and say, "It happened  sisters, and attacking women of all ages in  the street. Many husbands are violent.  Father-daughter incest (including stepfathers, common-law fathers and foster  fathers) is most prevalent.

December/January 1982    Kinesis   21  CULTURE  Women's jazz — Alive! and kicking  by Maura and Chantale Laplante  Alive',  played to a full house last month  at the Arts Club Theatre.   Chantale Laplante  and Maura,   two  local musicians,  were there  and interviewed band members Suzanne  Vincenza and Janet Small.  MAURA: How long have you been together as  a group?  SUZANNE:  rhiannon, Carolyn and I got together about five years ago. We played as  a trio for a couple of years before we  met Janet and Barb.  MAURA: Have changes in personnel made  changes in your music?  SUZANNE: As a trio we were very avant-  garde.  I was primarily a cello player,  rhiannon sang and played the piano, and  Carolyn played percussion. The instrumentation wasn't so standard in those days.  When we got a trap drum player and a piano  player, the instrumentation solidified  into a much more standard format.  We originally came together not to form  a band but to play music — you know that  distinction? We wanted to write, create,  play music. We had a kind of magical  connection among the three of us right  away.  It was like falling in love. After  the first time we played together we sat  around in a circle holding hands for the  longest time.  Eventually the band came  out of it.  JANET: For Barbara and me it was much  different.  I was auditioned, and hired '  for two gigs plus a tour.  On the tour it  was working real well, and it became  permanent.  CHANTALE: Was the jazz sound there from  the beginning?  SUZANNE: We met at a jazz workshop, and  it was always our intent to play jazz; to  play improvisational music, music of our  own creation. We've talked about this a  great deal. What is jazz?  JANET: When the band started out it sounded more avant-garde, and that's still  there at times. What's different is that  there has been added to that a driving  rhythm, certain structures in the arrangements, which are also part of a jazz  tradition because we still improvise on  them.  But there is not as much free improvisation.  Bringing a seed to fruition  MAURA:  I'm interested in the process you  use when you create and how much comes  from each player?  SUZANNE:  The process varies a lot.  In  the beginning, things were a lot more  collectively written.  Individuals brought  a seed of an idea into the group, then  through, many hours of playing it we would  develop it into a full song.  Now it depends on who is bringing the song, how  complete the arrangement will be. A piano  player can play melody, harmony and  rhythm on her instrument, whereas a drummer won't have the song as complete.  I  tend to come in with charts, the chords  written out, and the drummers fill in the  rhythm.  JANET:  The writing process is real  interesting.  There's a lot of collaboration, for example: Suzanne doing the  melody, and rhiannon doing the words. It's  different now than when the band was a  trio.  Five people is too many to just  create a piece together.  SUZANNE: Also, now this is a professional  band.  There are economic pressures to  Janet Small and Suzanne Vincenza of Alive!  get it together more quickly.  MAURA:  How do you deal with the difficulties of being on tour a lot? Do you  still have relationships at home, do you  bring people along?  JANET: It varies. Carolyn has a son.  She has a support system with the womoon  who lives across the street, so her son  can live at home, living kind of in both  houses, rhiannon and I both live in  households where there are kids and animals, and the people that are there keep  the thing going while we're gone.  "Playing together, we go someplace ..."  CHANTALE: What are some of the most exciting moments in playing music together?  SUZANNE:  For me, it's when I feel all of  us playing together, we go someplace with  a tune that we haven't gone before, and  we all feel it together.  JANET:  It all clicks into place, and you  can do things you didn't know you could  do. Sometimes that can happen with an  audience. A couple of years ago, in  Michigan, it happened.  SUZANNE: The whole audience rose up like  a tidal wave, with us.  JANET:  They all started doing this chant  for a while, and then fell silent. We  were all silent for at least a minute.  It was spontaneous. You can't plan those  things. Another high for me is to play  with people I've admired for a long time.  That happened on our last tour. We got  to play with Flora Purim and Airto.  SUZANNE: Then the low moments are ... no!  (laughter). When the sound system doesn't  work properly...  JANET: One of the things you have to deal  with when you're doing this professionally  is that it's no longer your living room —  you have to deal with electricity.  SUZANNE: Not only that, you're talking  about business — tour schedules, budgets,  booking agents — a variety of skills.  It's been very interesting to me, that it's  not just musical ability that determines  if you're going to play music in public  and keep at it.  It has to do with  business skills, and things like — do you  sleep well in a different bed every night?  JANET: I'm sure one of the reasons we  haven't heard of a lot of musicians is  they just didn't want to travel.  SUZANNE:  It's not that wemoon can't play  music or write music.  It's that wemoon  have traditionally been home with families.  MAURA: Not only that, but wemoon have  been discouraged from learning to promote  themselves, from doing the business things  ... when I first saw you in '77 you seemed  to be directing your music to wemoon's  audiences.  I'd like to know if and how  that has changed over time.  SUZANNE: As a group we very definitely  want to reach out to the world at large.  The world really needs the kind of energy,  music and philosophy that is embodied in  the band, which grew out of the wemoon's  movement and community.  It is our desire  to reach out to audiences of every colour  and persuasion and sex and race, to bridge  gaps between people.  JANET:  'Cause if we don't do it, we're  going to have problems. In terms of what's  happening to the earth, and trying to  keep the human race from being destroyed,  a lot of divisions aren't real useful. I'm  not saying that there is no reason for  wemoon-only things — that's how you find  strength.  That should always be possible.  But we did this benefit for a Native  American group, and it was the most interesting mix of people. There was our regular audience, primarily wemoon at that  time, then all these Indian guys talking  in the softest way about the mother earth.  That was really interesting.  SUZANNE: We have something in common with  these people.  MAURA:  Have you sacrificed anything in  your music to reach a broader audience?  SUZANNE: We are very interested in communicating, so if we're at an all-womoon  music festival there's a certain common  understanding, a certain way we can .be  with that group. A large theatre in a city  with many kinds of people demands a different way of communicating than a very  small, intimate theatre.  I personally  don't find it limiting. Sometimes it's a  challenge.  JANET: What you're talking about happens  mainly in between songs. Pretty much the  material we do doesn't change. For  example, we don't say, "We'll do 'Part of  Me' here because it is a wemoon's audience  but we won't do it here in this mixed  audience."  MAURA: Do wemoon ever say they would  rather you stayed focussed on wemoon's  audiences?  SUZANNE:  I don't think we've received  direct criticism to that effect, but it's  true there are people who feel that way.  JANET: I know there are some people who  might not come to a concert because it is  mixed. And that is their choice.  MAURA:  But you still do wemoon-only  concerts?  JANET: Yeah, we prefer to do that in a  town where we could do both — an all-  wemoon concert and a mixed concert.  continued on page 22 22   Kinesis    December/ January 1982  CULTURE  a  Music ... is at the heart of what I do on this earth"  by Marcia Meyer  Meg Christian's on tour to celebrate her  new album, Turning it Over — and so she  should.  This, her third album (preceded by J Know  lou Know  and Face the Music ) not only  makes another mark for her in the field  of women's music but represents a quality  contribution to the recording industry as  a whole.  Her producer, Betty Rowland, the women of  Olivia Records and she herself have done  an excellent job in presenting a top-notch  work to the music world.  This time Meg has the Bay Area Women's  String Ensemble backing her in four of  her songs, alo^ with some old favourites  throughout the album — Margie Adams on  acoustic piano, Chris Williamson on supporting vocals, Robin Flower on mandolin,  Dianne Lindsay on electric bass and supporting vocals — even Teresa Trull on  fundraising!  As always, her songs speak of women's  issues and her own personal unfolding.  The lyrics possess the clarity of an interview yet the warmth of a treasured love  poem.  In Meg's words, Turning it Over  is  as "honest and true as I could be, a  reflection of who I am."  Her styles range from classical and folk  to "down-south-country." In one song she  describes:  Fleeing confederate closets of pain  Losing the accents we learned to disdain  and concludes:  My southern home  No longer to blame  For the pain that I could have found  anywhere.  She has reclaimed southern beauty as her  own and for us to enjoy.  In keeping with her commitment to support  her sisters, she has called upon two  incredibly moving songs, other than her  own, about women — "There's a Light"  (Julie Homi) and "For Mama" (Linda Lewis).  Both are executed with the excellence we've  learned to expect from Meg.  ALIVE! AND KICKING continued from page 21-  MAURA:  It's obvious in your lyrics and  the moods you create, that you are interested in spiritual matters.  I'm interested  in what kinds of things you do besides the  performance of music. For your own selves.  JANET: Well, you're talking to the two  wrong people in the group. Let me tell  you about Carolyn. Her whole tradition is  a spiritual tradition that comes from  Africa. She is really into the Yoruban  religion.  SUZANNE: You know it's interesting we  would say "oh, you're talking to the wrong  people" whereas I feel that both of us are  quite spiritual, but not in any kind of  organized way. So we say, "there's  Carolyn ..."  That's a kind of organized way you can  point to someone's spirituality, when in  fact that's a form rather than the essence.  How do we get to the essence? I do gardening, and I feel in very deep contact  with the earth.  JANET:  The moon and I have a particular  thing, you know ... Actually, I wouldn't  call things spiritual. But I'm realizing,  especially in relationship to rhiannon,  that I do a lot of things she would call  praying, and for me it's just respect for  living things. For example, I would call  Her active virtuosity is displayed in two  numbers strictly for guitar.  "Moving  Right Along" is a modern, sprightly piece  lending itself to uncontrollable foot-  tapping and finger snapping.  "Window  Paynes" ("dedicated to Miss Mary Spoksi-  wood Payne and Miss Louise Payne — my  lifelong family and friends") is an impressive work written and performed in a  classical style that will rank high with  any conservatory-trained musician.  Meg never ceases to be without a sense of  humour, and on this album it lends itself  nicely to the song "Gym II":  So if you're in a rut,  just get off that  butt  Go down to that gym and pump that iron  Even if you're dying,   it's so satisfying  This song has such a powerful rhythm and  catchy chorus you'll find yourself "...  singing la la la ..." without even  thinking.  If you've lost a lover recently (or even  not so recently) beware — "Old Friend"  may cause an inevitable sympathetic vibration:  Old Friend  Come as my  lover  Old Friend  Come to my bed  Wrap you around me  Sing to me sweetly  Let us  love away  The wounded years.  ...   How have I loved you  ...  How have we changed  All of the years I could not love you  leave me hungry and open for you again.  This song displays Meg's classical training. The statement and answer phrases of  the music weave a piece so rich in melody  and harmony that only the very insensitive  could not be moved by it.  "Turning it Over" is a revealing song of  some of Meg's personal trials and tribulations.  It speaks to all women about  coming into our own:  And I'm feeling kind of lonely  but I'm mainly ok  I'm just all I can handle at the moment  feeling my changes,  feeling my pain  tiyrning it over  ...   and over again.  ...  And oh our revolutions  slowly spin me out '  and draw me in  ... And all I have left are these moments  of turning to comfort,   of turning to  friends.  The rich vocal line, the warm guitar,  string and horn arrangements all blend together in a moving composition that will  make you "... feel the seasons as they're  turning in your soul."  Turning it Over  is a must for any music  appreciator's record collection and you  will find yourself doing just that —  turning it over and over again.  It is  one of those albums I can't get enough of.  Meg says, "Music has been such a powerful  gift in my life. I'm trying to open more  and more to the music inside me, see what  flows out, and then use it respectfully —  because I realize my music, in all its  forms, is at the heart of what I do on  this earth." 0_  a percussion table a percussion table,  that little red one by the piano, and  rhiannon would call it an altar. But the  function is the same.  Hot only does it  have instruments on it we play, but it's  this beautiful thing that creates a certain  kind of feeling, in us and in the audience.  CHANTALE: I have a question about your  connection with your instruments. I know  that since I've been more involved with  music I have this incredible connection  with the piano. It could be called spiritual. I, too, don't put those words on  it, but there is something there.  SUZANNE:  I think of my acoustic bass and  cello as people.  They have essences —  they're persons.  It helps that their  shapes are very female-like and very  cuddly, and the contours are very warm  and soft.  JANET: My piano at home is like that.  Songs are like that, too.  They take on a  life of their own.  CHANTALE:  I want to ask about jazz, jazz  being a black music.  It has political  importance.  Jazz came out of —  SUZANNE:  -- of struggle — of people in  slavery.  JANET:  That's what makes it a good form  of music for people who are struggling,  because it has this ideal of freedom —  of each person expressing her/his individuality. It has this strength, and so  it's been picked up all over the world.  From its origins it has really grown.  The problem is that those black people who  created jazz never got the rewards. Not  that white people can't play jazz. That  would be like saying Calvin Simmons  couldn't conduct the Oakland Symphony  because he's black.  The problem is the  money all went to white record companies  and white popularizers of the form.  MAURA: What are your future visions and  plans?  JANET: As a group we only think one year  in advance.  If it continues to be a form  in which we can all grow and express cur-  seves, then it could go on for a long time.  But we're not married — just living  together.  SUZANNE: More immediately, we're planning  or. taking some time off this winter, then  touring again in the spring or summer. We  have our sights set on Europe — we really  want to play at the Montreaux. Jazz Festival.  We'd also like to go to Japan.  CHANTALE:  That's exciting! 0_ December/ January 1982    Kinesis   23  CULTURE  Hazel Dickens: Appalachian music with a message for women  by Cole Dudley and Jillian Ridington  Hazel Dickens,   of the singing duo,   Hazel  and Alice,   is a well-known writer and  performer in the world of women's music.  Her songs,   such as  "Don't Put Her Down,  You Helped Put Her There",  and "Working  Girl Blues",   touch women and speak of our  lives and struggles.  This past summer, Hazel Dickens performed  at the Vancouver Folk Festival, where this  interview took place.  KINESIS:  You are performing as a single  now.  What made you decide to do that?  HAZEL:  It wasn't a decision on my part to  perform alone.  It's just that the person  I was performing with wanted to try some  other things.  I have done things on my  own before, usually political concerts,  and benefits in conjunction with other  people.  So this is a departure in a sense from  what I was doing for many years, but in  another way it's a real growing period.  It's the first time I've been out on my  own trying to make a living off my music.  It's been a real experience.  KINESIS: How long have you been performing by yourself?  HAZEL: A little over two years now. But  I've been in the music since I960.  KINESIS: How long have you been writing  songs?  HAZEL: A long time now. In the beginning  I wrote songs just for the sake of writing  them. I didn't know anyone would want to  record them, or that I would want to  record. I got a lot of encouragement  from the women's community when I started  writing songs that were different.  KINESIS: Have you spent all your life  in the Appalachian music circles?  HAZEL: Yes.  I grew up in West Virginia  singing church music. My father was an  old-time banjo picker and singer who liked  to perform at parties. He liked to hear  me sing, so he encouraged that.  KINESIS: A lot of traditional country  and western songs put down women rather  than sympathizing with their struggles.  When did you begin to be conscious of  this?  HAZEL:  It came out of my growth later on,  when I was exposed to other music and got  around a little bit. When you stay in the  same place and associate with the same  people, you never hear anything different.  Traditional women want help and  respect, not pressure  I'm very much into lyrics now. Mainly, if  it's not real offensive to me and it's  traditional, I'm into preserving the music  of Appalachia and will sing it.  I do  select my material very carefully now.  I  don't sing sexist or racist songs — songs  that I used to sing before I was conscious  of what the songs were implying.  This has been a real growing period for  me. When I go to concerts of other people  now, I really listen to what they choose  to put in their concerts.  It influences  how I feel about those people.  I really  feel we have a responsibility as performers  to sing songs that have a positive message  and not songs that are offensive.  KINESIS: How does your family feel about  the songs you have written? Are they  supportive?,'     HAZEL: When I see my family now I try to  include them.  I give them my records and  leave it up to them.  I don't preach to  them and say this is the way to go.  Strangely enough, a lot of my more political songs my father really likes.  You know; if it's a good musical piece and  it moves them, people will listen to it.  Later they will deal with the words.  KINESIS: Who do you hope to reach with  your music?  HAZEL: Women who the women's movement  hasn't reached — the traditional women  who are isolated and stuck in the home all  day.  Rounder Records  If you don't know what you  came from, then you 're going  to have a hard time knowing  what you 're going to. You \e  got to know what your roots  are and deal with that.  The women's movement has not dealt with  traditional women.  I know they would like  to, but they want to change them and I  know these women don't want to be changed.  They want some help and respect, but they  can't be forced to be what some of the  younger women are.  Most of the younger women have an education and they can go out and get something  besides waitress and factory work.  Older  women stay in those traditional jobs for  the security.  I've been stuck in those  jobs for years.  I still feel very insecure about supporting myself with the  music.  KINESIS: Do you think your music reaches  the women you are writing about?  HAZEL:  I think so.  I had a woman at a  Women's Festival come up to me with tears  in her eyes. She said she was so glad  that I was there. She couldn't relate to  the rest of what was happening there.  Most of those women who listen to the  radio or watch TV all day are not going to  listen to a song unless it says something  directly to them.  If I am going to write  songs, I want to speak to those women  they are getting passed by.  "We need to reach out"  ivINESIS: Do you do a lot of women's  festivals?  HAZEL: Not a lot.  I have done some and  will still do them.  But I don't like to  go on at a festival and have to be made to  feel badly because I'm doing "uraditional  music as well as my other music. As I've  said so often, if you don't know what  you came from, then you're going to have  a hard time knowing what you're going on  to. You've got to know what your roots  are and deal with that, then you make the  decision where you're going to go.  KINESIS:  Do you perform at other festivals?  HAZEL: Yes.  I try to put myself in  places where a variety of people will  come. We women know how we feel about all  our problems and we know what we want.  I  know we have to get with each other and  have that space to talk, but we also need  to reach out.  Support for women coal miners  KINESIS: You did the music for the film  "Harlan County" didn't you?  HAZEL: Yeah, I did a lot of the sound  track. I wrote the end song especially  for the film and was consultant on some  of the music they used.  any other film  KINESIS: Have you <  sound tracks?  HAZEL:  I just wrote a song for a film  about women coal miners, which will be  out soon.  It's a real good film — real  strong.  I've played at the Women's Coal  Mining Convention for the last three  years. A lot of women work in the mines  because it pays more. What they are  trying to do, I totally support.  Ordinarily, I wouldn't ask anybody to risk  their lives like that, but they are having  to struggle to gain acceptance in the mine.  KINESIS: What music do you have coming  up?  HAZEL:  I've just released a new record on  Rounder Records, called "Hard Hitting  Songs for Hard Hitting People".  It has  a lot of songs I've written on it, plus  some other real good message songs.  I'm  starting to work on my next album now.  Hazel Dickens is willing to perform at  concerts and festivals.

This play, by Betty Lambert, revolves  around a sterilization statute which  existed in Alberta from 1928 - 1971 (and  in B.C. until 1973).  The statute provides  that inmates of mental hospitals could be  sterilized if the directors of the hospital agreed that "the patient might safely  be discharged (only) if the danger of  procreation with its attendant risks of  multiplication of the evil by transmission  of the disability to progeny were eliminated."  According to Lambert, 25% of all Metis  women in Alberta were sterilized during  the time the statute was in effect.  "Many  people who were running the law saw evil  as poverty, epilepsy, alcoholism, etc.",  she says.  Telling our lives out loud  "Jennie's Story" is true.  There actually  was a woman in Lambert's small Alberta  town, who worked as a domestic for a priest  who had an affair with her. He then had  her. sterilized without her knowledge.  When, later in life, the woman discovered  she was sterile, she drank lye and died.  This is Jennie's Story.  Lambert adds that when she told her mother  she was going to write a play about the  story her mother had told her, her mother  denied it was true.  Set in Southern Alberta, the play opens  with Jennie (Sherry Bie) waking up to a  cold grey dawn as her husband Henry  McGrane (Pierre Tetrault) comes in with  the local Catholic priest Father Edward  Fabrizeau (David Ferry).  Jennie serves the men home-made apple pie,  never pausing to sit with them "because  my mother never sat with her men." Jennie  strains to please her husband.  It becomes apparent from the conversation  that Father Edward is not popular in the  community. Many think him responsible for  the recent hailstorms and other community  problems. It .is rumoured he is living in  mortal sin and therefore bringing God's  wrath upon the community.  His sin was that he seduced Jennie when  she was younger, not yet married and  cleaning house for him.  The temptation of  young Jennie became too much for him and  she was sent to an institution for the  mentally handicapped, sworn not to speak a  word to anyone.  The panel judging her  mental competence, found her deficient,  and proceeded to grant a sterilization  request made by her mother.  Jennie thought  it was an appendectomy.  Several years later, now married, she finds  she cannot become pregnant and writes to  the Calgary doctor who performed the  "appendectomy". Upon learning what really  happened, she falls into despair.  Molly Dorval (Laura Bruneau) is used in  the play to counter Jennie's character.  She is a pregnant fifteen-year-old who  comes to clean the house while Jennie is  away, under the watchful eye of Jennie's  mother (Lillian Carlson).  Molly is an uncomplicated teenager who  blushes when her pregnancy is mentioned.  Bruneau plays the character with refreshing  realism, giggling at jokes, and screaming  with delight at the McGrane's recently  installed electric lights.  Transformation is moving, but it  doesn't last  Sherrie Bie delivers a strong perfc  The final scene, in which Jennie confronts  the Father about her sterilization, is  extremely moving, even painful to watch.  All the players work well together and the  effect is intriguing.  It is a sign of growing feminist awareness  that Jennie seeks revenge from the Father  for his sins at the end of the play. Her  transformation from meek prairie housewife  to enraged woman is very effective.  My only wish is that Jennie could have been  allowed to use her anger in a less self-  destructive way. She commits suicide at  the end. In the context of the play, it  seems inevitable, but it is disappointing  that she could not use her rage to help  create a new life for herself.  0  Judy Chicago launches The Birth Project  Judy Chicago is alive and well, and living  in Benicia, California. She resurfaced last  fall - after receiving accolades and barbs  for her Dinner Party - when she held the  first public meeting for those interested  in contributing their work to her new Birth  Project.  Since its opening at the San Francisco  Museum of Modern Art in March 1979, the  Dinner Party has been displayed in only  three other cities - Boston, Houston and  Brooklyn. Thousands of dollars have been  spent storing the fragile dinner plates,  and shipping costs have become prohibitive.  During the spring of 1980, I began  doing research- on birth imagery  for a tapestry I was designing. I  wanted to use the birth process as  a metaphor for the creation of the  universe. I was shocked to  discover how few works of art or  literature depicted the actual birth  process and realized that this was  another area — like women s  history was when I began The  Dinner Party — that had rarely  been used as the subject matter for  major art works.  -Judy Chicago  The Birth Project will be different - both  in subject matter and in form - from the  Dinner Party, which present 39 place settings (china plates and embroidered runners) honouring women whom Chicago feels  contributed significantly to history.  "I'm now in favour of anything that can  be rolled up, stuck in a mailing tube,  and sent through the mail," Chicago has  said. The work for the Birth Project will  be exclusively needlework - embroidery,  applique, knitting and needlepoint, maybe  It is also doubtful that the result will  be displayed in one place, like a museum,  as one unified project.  Instead, Chicago hopes to generate enough  finished pieces depicting the images of  birth to distribute them separately, until  the women's centres, birthing rooms and  public hallways of America are covered  with them.  Judy Chicago hopes to have 25 needlework  pieces completed for the Birth Project by  the end of the year. And the northern California organization is only the beginning  for the project. Chicago also hopes to  gather groups of skilled needle workers  together In three other metropolitan areas  as well as in a rural southern area.  Laura Fritz of Inverness attended the first  organisational meeting in Benicia, and  since then has set up her own group of embroiderers. Fritz is now working with 20  women, each of whom had to complete a  Chicago-designed sampler by March 1. Chicago evaluates the work done by each of  these women before accepting them into the  project.  Anyone interested in working on the Birth  Project or making a donation should contact Judy Chicago at Through the Flower  Corporation,   P.O.   Box 842,   Benicia,   CA  94510.

December/ January 1982   Kinesis   25  REVIEWS  Warning: office work is hazardous to your health  by Jan DeGrass  Your job already makes you sick. Right?  Or perhaps not, if you're fortunate. But  you still may want to know how any office  job can make you physically ill.  The book  that explains this phenomenon is called  Office Hazards  by Joel Makower.  Everything is dangerous, according to  Makower—from the air you breathe to the  coffee you drink on your break, from the  lumber used in the office furniture, to  the lighting over your desk.  I must applaud Makower for pointing out  that occupational health and safety should  not be confined to the factory floor and  to the use of heavy equipment, or to obviously hazardous occupations like demolition.  There are many chronic and less  obvious hazards in the average office.  Their symptoms may be even more insidious  as they build up slowly and their effects  may not be known for many years.  But I must also admit that I'm heartily  sick of the spate of "everything-is-  dangerous" books and articles prevalent  in recent years. It's already hard enough  for me to get out of bed in the morning  without knowing that my coffee is laced  with carcinogens, my walls are breathing  radon, and my very typewriter paper may  cause me to itch.  So with this somewhat jaundiced eye I  picked through Makower's findings to cull  what knowledge seemed to bear scrutiny.  There was an astonishing amount of believable information.  Energy-efficient, maybe — healthy, no  Makower also puts these findings into  some kind of context.  He links recent  findings in office hazards with the growth  of energy-efficient buildings that nas  taken place within the last two decades.  As the buildings become tighter and well-  insulated they also become more effective  at sealing in used air. Heat loss was  greatest through the windows, so many  modern office buildings are designed with  windows that won't open, and are sealed  from drafts.Hazardous substances in the  air, chemicals, molds, etc., are not  allowed to escape through cracks in the  building's structure or through the windows.  Instead they are returned through  the efficient ventilation system, which  ensures that each floor gets a dose of  the same air, not just once, but over and  over again.  In other words, the air you  breathed at 8:30 a.m. may again fill your  lungs at 2:30 in the afternoon.  That air could contain any of the following chemicals: ethanol, found in duplicating fluids, cadmium, from cigarette  smoke, carbon monoxide, sucked in from  outside traffic or from underground  parking lots, or toluene, found in rubber  cement.  It could contain molds, specifically a variety that grows in the cooling  towers of those ventilation systems, or  harmful particles, like asbestos or fibre-  glass.  Old fashioned office buildings  where windows can still be opened can also  have a harmful particulate problem.  Asbestos and fibreglass can deteriorate  over the years and small particles will  find their way into the air.  Makower also probes the physical and psychological hazards caused by the latest addition to office furniture—the video display  terminal. A wide range of problems have  been associated with VDT's, partly from  their design, and partly from the way they  are used.  Some common problems include eyestrain (the  terminals glare and flicker), back strain  caused by awkward postures held for a long  stretch, and psychological stress, caused  by a machine-set work pace which is inflexible and rigorous.  One such example was that of a Bell Telephone repair office in Washington,D.C.  where VDT workers respond to repair service  requests by contacting repair crews via  computer.  It is also the computer that prints out  employee lists of coffee breaks and lunch-  times.  Now some of the office staff have  their, morning breaks within 15 minutes of  arrival at work, so that their stations can  be covered at all times. Workers cannot  go to the bathroom without finding someone  to take their place.  "If you close your terminal," said one  service rep, "right away the computer starts  clacking away and starts ringing a bell."  At the end of the day, a computer printout  informs each supervisor of how many calls  each clerk has taken and for how long the  al was unused.  In defence of computers, the problem lies  not so much in the machine itself, but in  the management that controls it. Machines  are programmed by people. Although Makower  continually points out the underlying attitudes of management to these worker problems  he does not develop any analysis of management/staff dynamics. A very powerful case  could be made to relieve worker oppression  by linking some of Makower's abundant data  with management-labour theory.  A good introduction to office hazards  Throughout the book Makower points to a  major problem of office design: the staff  are never consulted.  The people who must  spend forty hours a week, living and working in a space are often not asked for  their opinion on what is important to them  in their environment.  "White noise" is a good example.  It's a  masking sound similar to a waterfall or an  untuned radio broadcast designed to allow  many workers in the same open office to  carry on private conversations and I have  yet to meet an office worker who has anything favourable to say about it. Apparently  bitter battles have ensued in offices where  the technique is employed.  In a recently-  constructed Washington, D.C. building a  $100,000 masking system was shut off completely after only a few months due to  worker complaints.  What is  important to office workers?  In 1980, a poll was taken to find out  exactly what workers considered 'very  important' in their work environment.  Good lighting led the list, closely followed by a comfortable chair and good circulation of air.  They seem like simple requests but they are often abused.  Working Women, a U.S. national organization of office workers, released the  results of a different kind of survey in  April, 1981. After interviewing nearly  1,000 office workers in Boston and Cleveland, they concluded that there is a  "virtual epidemic of stress symptoms and  stress-related disease among office  workers".  Seventy two and a half per  cent of the respondents reported "somewhat stressful" or "very stressful"  working conditions, based primarily on  lack of promotions or raises, low pay,  monotonous repetitive work, and no input  into decision-making.  Stress-related disease virtually epidemic  Stress is difficult to define and even  harder to alleviate. An obvious result  of chronic stress is coronary heart  disease. Apparently women clerical workers developed coronary heart disease at  almost twice the rate of other white or  blue collar female workers or housewives.  A lack of autonomy and a lack of control  over work environment are continually  pointed to as a leading factor in stress-  related diseases.  Many office workers are avid for data on  health hazards in their workplace. A  February Kinesis  supplement on the topic  has received many reprint requests.  For  those people the Makower text is what I  would call a good "first contact" book.  It doesn't fully explore any one hazard  and therefore cannot be called a complete  text, but instead it is a mesh of catalogued information touching many areas  and supported by an extensive bibliography.  0.

Can't remember? Well, you're not alone.  Most of us, subconsciously at least, believe . .  that games are for kids; that play is some- ' -* *  thing rightfully left behind when we reach  adulthood.  Then there are those of us who look back on  games with distaste, because of the oppressive emphasis often placed on competition,  "**  at the expense of fun for all.  There is an alternative to missing out, one  we think everybody, young or older, should  give a try. It's the co-operative game.  Co-operative (or new) games are not all  non-competitive, but they are challenging,  and are based on the principle of playing  the game hard and well, keeping the enjoyment of all players in mind. Paramount is  that the game be fun.  Participation in games is voluntary. Individual players set their own level and  limits within a game, and are free to drop  out when they've had enough. Initially,  someone who knows a game will explain it  and act as a player-referee, watching out  for player safety during the game. Players  are free to suggest new rules or changes  to make it more fun, as the game progresses.  Anybody can play  We often "play" with children or with  people our own age, but neglect to involve  older people. New games are designed for  any number of people, any age. Games are  adapted to the needs of the players by  changing the boundaries, "handicapping"  some players, or introducing special rules.  Thus games make use of skills and mobility  that all players share.  Game plans can be as wild as imagination  permits, employing rituals and fantasies,  chanting, new story lines for old games,  and a lot of movement or a little. A game  can have a built-in end or not, as players  decide.  An important part of new games is the concept of a "play community" - simply a  co-operative mentality involving familiarity and trust, which has developed among a  given group of players. Where players do  not at first know each other, it is important to begin with games which slowly build  a trusting play space, for both safety and  enjoyment.' s sake.  Games which involve a lot of physical contact or a trust in people to be careful of  each other will work best where some playing  together has created a group feeling between  people.  Over several years now, many people have been  involved in play session and festivals creating games - playing and adapting them.  Some of these are compiled in two books  called "The New Games Book" and "More New  Games" by A. Fluegelman - available from  most libraries in Vancouver, or through  bookstores. They can be ordered through  Doubleday in Canada.  For information on where to learn some new  games locally, call Lisa Nickerson at 263-  3467 or Ralph Motzek at 943-4409.  ^*  *^¬£  One of these, Family Pastimes (R.R.#4,  Perth, Ontario K7H 3C6), makes games in  which "everyone cooperates to solve the  problems or obstacles the game itself  raises", bearing in mind however that  the games do not "protect (players) from  experiencing failure."  Games like Mountaineering, Zen Blocks,  and Our Town call for a team effort.  Another, called Choices, is values-  oriented and revolves around challenges  that individuals meet at various life  stages.  Family Pastimes' distributor in Vancouver is Jollean Fairehels, 874-5883.  Animal Town Game Company (P.O. Box 2002,  Santa Barbara, CA 93120) offers a different selection of games, still based  on co-operative values, but focusing  more on nature and conservation. Their  games include, among others, Back to  the Farm, Save the Whales, and Dam  Builders - which promise to be educational as well as fun.  Games for the armchair athlete  You say it's board games you really like?  There are two sources we know of which  produce board games based on a cooperative, rather than a competitive, principle.  TOE FENCING  Start off with something active to work  up an appetite...  To play, we face each other, holding  hands. Then we try to tap the tops of  each other's toes with our own. When  one of us scores three hits, it's time  to switch to a new partner.  The frenzy generated by Toe Fencing  places a premium on honest self ref-  ereeing - the name of the game is not  Toe Stomping.  Players should be equally armed - bare  feet to bare feet, sneakers to sneakers,  moccasins to moccasins.  We do not advise playing in steel-toed  boots or six-inch spike heels unless  everyone is equipped with shin guards.  (from More New Games)  CLAM FREE  A game for a few dozen or more...  Whenever people come together in common cause, there's a perfect opportunity to strengthen the community  through play. This game arose out of  an alternative-energy fair.  We start by defining the boundaries  of the playing field. One person  volunteers to be the nuclear reactor  and activates himself with a Frisbee  or Nerf Ball, preferably Day-Glo.  The rest of us are clams, and we can  so signify by being as happy as possible.  The object of the game is for the nuclear reactor to contaminate all the  clams by tagging them with the Day-Glo  device. Once contaminated, the clams  become frozen in place.  As the reactor chases and tags the  clams, it would appear that doomsday  is just around the corner - at least  for the hapless clams who are getting  zapped one after the other.  There is hope however. A frozen clam  can be defrosted if two mobile clams  manage to link elbows around her in a  clamshell-like alliance and shout  "Clam free!"  Better yet, if four or more hand-holding, immune clams manage to encircle  the reactor and shout "Melt downi",  the reactor must shut down for good.  We might want to adjust the rules (or  even the fantasy) to make the game  playable for different groups, (from  More New Games)  More games on page 27 December/January 1982    Kinesis   27  CULTURE  Lily Briscoe: a candid portrait of Mary Meigs  by Mary Schendlinger  Last summer I was a typesetter. Sometimes  being a typesetter is awful, like when  you're doing insurance forms, or a poetry  book that is either over your head or full  of baloney. But sometimes the piece you're  setting Is so satisfying you forget you're  in an office, you forget you're working on  a dangerous machine, you even forget you're  striking keys, and just read the book.  That is how it was for me when I typeset  Lily Briscoe: A Self-Portrait  by Mary  Meigs.  As it happens, I ended up going to work  for Talonbooks, the publisher, and I ended  up meeting Mary and running her around the  country to publicize the book.  Before we met, we had many occasions to  talk on the telephone as we arranged  publicity for her in four cities.  Every  time I talked to Mary, I had two impressions: one came from the soft, even frail-  sounding voice on the other end of the  line; the other came from the tough,  courageous memoir I had been typesetting  and promoting.  Lesbian identity threatens interviewers  When I got to Montreal in November, I  phoned Mary to arrange to meet her. As  I started to describe myself so she could  recognise me, she said, "Oh that's all  right. I will know who you are." And  after five minutes with her, I felt I'd  known her a long time.  Mary is a small woman, tiny even; I was  afraid I'd crush her in a too-enthusiastic  hug.  But I learned again not to judge a  book by its cover (although I hope everyone else will, for Mary's self-portrait  on the front of Lily Briscoe  is stunning).  She is not  fragile.  Here is a woman who is 64 years old, who  is publishing for the first time, who is  coming out as a lesbian during one of the  worst periods of backlash in the history  of the women's movement.  So it was no surprise when one of the  interviews in Toronto fell through.  "My  book threatens everybody," Mary writes in  Lily Briscoe.  Another interview all but ignored the  creation of the autobiography, preferring  to discuss the strangeness of Mary's  sexuality, her feelings about her mother,  ("Did you hate her? Is that why ...?")  and the lack of wrinkles on her face.  "I'm not exactly nobody myself"  It's hard to do media appearances for the  first time, and it's interesting.  One of  Mary's most endearing qualities is her  openness to people. She told me after her  Toronto media whirl that the strangest  thing was the artificiality of the situations. She knows the interviewer isn't  supposed to talk much, but Mary is as  good a listener as she is a talker. She  instinctively tries to have a real conversation.  Nevertheless, she is a fast learner, and  by the time we hit Vancouver she was  describing to me her "new loquacious  style."  Reading Lily Briscoe: A Self-Portrait  is a  lot like being with Mary.  She has a conversation with you, in which she is candid  and forthcoming, and invites you to be the  same.  She talks about her mother, her  childhood, her twin sister — she tells  you the things you would ask about.  She talks about her friends, who just  happen to be the art "heavies" — Edmund  Wilson, Marie-Glaire Blais, Mary McCarthy  and Bowden Broadwater, Bessie Breuer, Anne  and Fenry Varnum Poor, Wallace Putnam,  Leonid. She has been accused of name-  dropping.  "It's not my fault if I know  famous people," Mary says.  "And after all,  I'm not exactly nobody myself." She writes  openly abnut living in the tender, difficult triangle with Marie-Claire Blais and  Barbara Deming.  Sharing less dangerous than you think  As I read Lily Briscoe  I frequently said,  "Yes! That's exactly right!" as she  calmly and confidently expressed in one  sentence what I had been trying to explain  to myself for months — about friendship,  intimacy, caring.  Mary talks about lots of other things too  — birds, books, illness, fear, creativity  oppression, political action.  She leaves  herself open to criticism and question  from all sides, because she herself is an  undaunted questioner.  This is the real beauty of Lily Briscoe  and of Mary Meigs.  "I have opened my soul  to interpretation," she writes, "and  dragged others with me ... One gives up  power by sharing oneself with others; in  another sense, one gains from receiving  from other people.  The fear is that the  fragile pieces of oneself will be mistreated, broken, altered beyond recognition. My belief is that the sharing of  oneself is much less dangerous than one  thinks."  So, okay, I'll come clean.  This is not  an article written by an unbiased reporter  In fact, I think it's false, maybe even  dangerous to pretend there is such a thing  as objectivity.  I believe Mary Meigs  would be the first to agree with me.  Lily Briscoe: A Self-Portrait  is published by Talonbooks in Vancouver (264 pp.  color cover, perfect bound, $8.95). Q  COOPERATIVE GAMES continued from page 26  STAND UP  A co-operative game for pulling a  group together to play...  Sit on the ground, back-to-back with  your partner, knees bent and elbows  linked. Now simply stand up together.  With a bit of cooperation and a little practice, this shouldn't be too  hard.  By the time you've got this mastered,  you'll probably have drawn an interested spectator.. Have her join you on  the ground, and all three try to stand  up.  This feat should take you just long  enough to attract another onlooker.  Have him join you. Four people standing up together might be a genuine  accomplishment.  By this time you should realize that  there's more struggling, stumbling,  and giggling each time you add another person. But this very fact assures  you of an endless supply of fascinated spectators, ready to join up to  help you get off the ground.  A gracefully executed Mass Stand Up  (any number greater than five) is  like a blossoming flower - but a  more rare event. To achieve it, start  by sitting close and firmly packed.  Then all stand up quickly and at  precisely the same moment. (from  New Games Book)  SNAP  For a quick, less active game for two,  try snap...  First, we decide on three sound-and-  motion signals - the sillier the better, of course. We might try a turkey  gobble with our fingers flapping next  to our ears, or maybe a cheer performed with our thumbs deftly placed on  our noses. Or how about a descending  dive-bomber whistle terminating in a  digital explosion?  Once we've agreed on the signals, the  rest of the game is a Snap. We turn  back to back, count to three, and spin  to face each other while we each make  one of the signals.  If we make the same signal, we've won  so to speak, and can move on to our  next playful pursuit.  But if we find ourselves facing each  other with two different forms of  silliness, we've got to turn around  and try again. (Most pairs manage  to match up in the first 397 tries. )  We can also play in threes or in  three teams. In the latter version,  each team comes up with one sound-  and-motion signal. When everyone perfects all three signals, the teams  huddle and decide which to perform,  on cue, as a team.  A three-team match  wins it for everyone. (from More New  Games)     9_ December/January 1982  REVIEWS  Jane Bowles' work  by Julie Wheelwright  Jane Bowles was a writer who led an extraordinary life. And even though she published very little in her 56 years, everything had her unique touch.  A Little Original Sin  is a biography chro-  nicalling the life and work of this little  known American writer. Author Millieent  Dillion has amassed 458 pages of interviews, letters and articles about Bowles  that successfully convey her character.  A Little Original Sin  by Millieent Dillion  Published by Holt, Rinehard and Winston  (458 pages, $21.95)  Jane Bowles' work has recently been revived by feminists interested in lost or  forgotten works. What Bowles had to say  about women, like all of her messages, is  difficult to decipher. But in her best  known novel, Two Serious Ladies,   she captures a pain and confusion in vivid tones.  Whatever her critics said about her (and  most said they couldn't understand her),  they respected what she wrote for its originality. This theme, that Jane was an unforgettable woman to her friends, husbands  and loves, resurfaces again and again in  Dillion's book.  Born Jane Auer, Bowles began life in  Woodmere, Long Island. She terrorized  the neighborhood with her cousin Mary  Jane and once painted all the clothes on  nearby lines brilliant blue. As Mary Jane  recalls:  "The sight of these sky-blue shirts and  sheets dancing in the breeze whetted our  appetites. We headed for the garage. I  swear that not a word was spoken. We were  in luck. More cans of paint, a shiny  sedan to decorate, bottles to break!  "All that day we wandered over the countryside. No garage was safe. We pillaged  and painted, smashed and destroyed property in the amount of $280."  The two girls left a note warning neighbors to repent of their sins, for the day  of judgment was nearing. Indeed, Bowles'  sense of sin seemed to plague her all her  life, and like her character Miss Goering,  she felt the need to confront what was  most frightening to her.  Jane was born with a stiff knee, and at  16 developed tuberculosis in her knee.  She had to spend two years in Switzerland  fighting it. In an autobiographical fragment, she recalls: "When I was little I  had to imagine that there was some limit  to physical pain in order to enjoy the  day."  A year later, she had an operation to  stiffen her knee joint permanently.  Back in New York, Jane began her first  novel, in French. In a mock-naive style,  it satirized the Greek myth of Phaethon.  But, like details of much of her early  life, the manuscript is now lost.  At 19, Jane met her future husband,  composer and author Paul Bowles. According to Dillion, the two decided on marriage as a great joke and were wed a few  weeks later. Theirs was an unusual marriage in that Jane lived with Paul on and  off but continued to have affairs with  women.  This aspect of Jane's life provides a  fascinating glimpse into the New York  gay scene in the 1940s. Jane made no  bones about her sexuality. She once told  her friend Miriam Levy about going to a  dinner with two young bachelors from  Minneapolis and a lovely, proper woman  who had come along as a date for one of  them.  During dinner, Jane followed the woman  into the washroom and said, "Now I'm  going to count to 10 and if you're not  a lesbian, get the hell out of here."  The woman ran out of the room, tears  streaming down her face.  Jane would arrive at dinner parties with  a woman and say, "Hello, I'm Jane Bowles,  I'm a lesbian, and this is my lover." She  would giggle; the dinner guests would  blush.  When Jane and Paul moved to Morocco in  1948, they lived almost separate lives,  Jane with her Arab lover Cherifa and Paul  with Ahmed Yacoubi, a young Moroccan  artist. They would see each other daily  and friends commented they were very close  and loving with each other.  Jane and Paul.broke off sexual relations  early in their marriage, each finding and  occasionally living with other lovers.  But they were dedicated to each other,  and Jane said that Paul was an excellent  teacher. In fact, she would shrug off the  success of Two Serious Ladies,   saying  "Paul practically wrote it anyway."  Dillion points out that while both Jane  and Paul wrote, and Paul received more  critical success, it was Jane who broke  away from the conventional novel, creating  a more original structure.  One of Jane's play, In the Sumraerhouse,  was produced on Broadway. But critics  charged the play was too complex, and it  closed after a short run.  Jane wrote throughout her life, but she  had great problems overcoming blocks and  demanded that all her work be completely  original. She would spend hours writing,  crossing out and revising her work. "Well,  we can't have two writers in the family,"  she would tell her friends.  Unfortunately, little of Jane's work has  been published. This book about her recalls her vibrance, although at times the  account seems to repeat itself and drag,  even though the story itself is fascinating.  In 1957, living in Morocco, Jane suffered  a crippling stroke. She who had once  dubbed herself "Crippie, the kyke dyke,"  was left unable to read and could write  only with great effort. She fought her  illness for 16 years, considering it  punishment for not having written more.  After treatment in England and New York,  Jane regained some of her ability and  returned to Morocco. But she never published a completed work after her stroke,  and in 1967 was admitted to a psychiatric  hospital in Malaga, Spain.  Of the time leading up to Jane's breakdown, Dillion writes:  "When Jane was  younger a great part of her beguiling  charm was the sense she gave other people  that through some force in her they were  liberated.  "Now that she was out of control, that  force had become terrifying. She had become a thing of embarrassment, a thing of  shame, a thing to be avoided."  Before she was readmitted to the sanitor-  ium, Jane lived in a bar called The Atlas,  in Tangiers. She had become known as an  eccentric, a sort of bag woman who drank  a great deal and tried to amuse people  with her antics. But she knew that inevitably Paul would come to take her back to  Malaga. On the last evening before her  readmittance, an old friend, David Herbert,  went to visit her.  To hi.s suggestion that he throw a party  for her, Jane replied: "If you do, you'd  better give it in the cemetery, because  I'm dead."  At the end of her stay in the clinic, she  was blind, unable to move, often unable  to speak. According to the Catholic nuns  caring for her, she accepted conversion.  Jane died in May, 1973, after another  stroke. When World Authors wrote to her  asking for a short autobiography, all she  would write was "I started to 'write'  when I was about 15 and was obliged to do  composition in school. I always thought  it the most loathsome of all activities  and still do. At the same time I felt  even then that I had to do it. It was  only after the end of World War II that I  came to Morocco. Paul had come ahead of  me and bought a house in Tangier. From  the first day, Morocco seemed more dreamlike than real. I felt cut off from what  I knew. In the 20 years that I have lived  here I have written only two short stories  and nothing else. It's good for Paul,  but not for me."  Dillion's book does capture Jane and the  tragedy of her life. But the questions  about her enormous problems in writing  and the root of her compulsions are never  answered. Jane's story is well worth  reading, however, and it is clear her  death marked a great loss to the world.  Q December/ January 1982   Kinesis   29  BOYCOTTS  These goods are HOT — don't buy them!  Wondering what products to boycott? Here's  an up-to-the-minute list, compiled by The  Clarion,  a Toronto alternate newspaper.  MICHELIN  The boycott mounted by the United Rubber  Workers continues.  The AFL-CIO and the  Canadian Labour Congress have added the  tire manufacturer to their list of "those  unfair to organized labour." The labour  organizations pointed out that Michelin  tires, and radial tires sold under the  Sears Allstate brand, are not union made.  The URW has been frustrated in efforts to  organize Michelin's plants in Nova Scotia.  GUATEMALA  The National Committee for Union Unity of  Guatemala, the International Confederation  of Free Trade Unions, and the International  Food Workers Union have urged a boycott of  the tourist industry in this strife-torn  Central American country.  Five to six  thousand Canadians annually take vacations  in Guatemala.  The boycott is designed to  dispel myths which are circulating about  Guatemala being an unspoiled paradise.  THE HUNGER PROJECT  This is a thinly disguised offshoot of the  profit-oriented EST movement. The Hunger  Project claims that if we all think about  world hunger in the right way ("beyond  logic") it will soir.ehow stop.  In spite of  this feeble premise, the California-based  project has raised large amounts of money,  ostensibly on behalf of the poor and starving.  Little or none of this money has  actually been used to feed hungry people,  but it has been divided among a variety of  loosely-defined internal expenses.  The  Hunger Project is actively raising money in  many parts of Canada.  SOUTH AFRICA  The boycott against South Africa's apartheid practices continues. Please boycott  the following: Granny Smith apples. Out-  span citrus fruit, canned fruit such as  South African peaches, York, DC. Del Monte,  Gold Reef, Success, Dominion No Name apricots, Pantry Shelf pears and DC pineapples.  Rothman's of Canada is part of a South  Africa based multinational which, through  its subsidiaries such as Jordan Wines, and  Carling O'Keefe Breweries produce the following products:  Cigarettes: Rothmans,  Dunhill, Perilly, Peter Stuyveyant, Craven.  A, Dumont, Number 7, Black Cat.  Beers:  Carling Black Label, Carlsberg, Old Vienna,  O'Keefe, Buckeye, Colt 45, Toby, Heidelberg,  Red Cap, Brading, Dow, Dow Porter, Black  Horse and Cinci.  ZELLERS AND THE BAY  The Quebec Federation of Labour called for  a boycott Of all Zellers and Bay stores  in Quebec because employees, seeking their  first contract, have been on strike for  mere than 17 months.  There are 72 persons  on strike — 69 of them women.  The CFL  has asked the Canadian Labour Congress to  endorse a nation-wide boycott of Zellers  and Bay stores, but the CLC as yet has not.  GENERAL FOODS,  PROCTOR & GAMBLE  A boycott of General Foods and Proctor  and Gamble products has been initiated by  the Consumer Information Service (CIS) to  protest the enormous amounts of money  spent on advertising by these two companies every year.  The two advertisers,  Proctor and Gamble, and General Foods last  year spent about $1 billion. According to  the CIS, the companies "saturate daytime  TV advertising women's products which  appear to be competitive (like Brim and  Sanka) but are actually made by the same  company." The companies, in turn, "don't  reinvest their profits in programs, services, housing or jobs, in the poor communities which buy these products."  Boycott these products — Maxwell House,  Sanka, Uban,. Brim, Koolaid Drink Mix,  Tang Instant Breakfast, Orange Plus, Sugar  Crisp, Grapenuts, Alfabits, Post Toasties,  Log Cabin Syrup, Lean Crisp, Jello Instant  Pudding, Kool Whip, Jello D«£erta Gelatin,  Dream Whip, Shake and Bake, Stove Top  Stuffing, Good Seasons Salad Dressing,  Minute Rice and Birds Eye vegetables.  Proctor and Gamble — Ivory Soap, Zest  Soap, Secret Deodorant, Charmin, Head and  Shoulders Shampoo.  NESTLES  This is an attempt to stop Nestles from  promoting its infant formula products in  Third World countries. The World Health  Organization has estimated that 10 million children have suffered from malnutrition and baby bottle diseases because  of these products. The boycott continues  despite the recent adoption by the WHO of  an international marketing code for  breast-milk substitutes.  Don't buy: Nescafe, Encore, Decaf, Tasters  Choice, Nestea, Nestles Quik, Libby's,  Souptime, Maggi soups, Cross and Blackwell,  Wispride, Cherryhill cream cheese, Swill  Knight, Old Fort cheese, Montclair mineral water (are you listening Karen Kain? )  Beachnut baby foods, Time and McFeeter's  honey butter.  BANK OF  COMMERCE  The Canadian Labour Congress has urged all  union members to boycott the Commerce to  protest the lockout of CIBC employees in  East Angus Quebec more than a year ago.  The CLC is also urging all unions to cease  banking with the CIBC.  If the boycott is  successful, the bank would lose an estimated $850-million in union funds.  The  Commerce has about 1,800 offices across  Canada with some 36,000 non-management  workers. Among the largest CLC affiliates  with funds in the Commerce are the United  Steelworkers, Ontario Public Service  Employees, and the B.C. Government Employ-  CAMPBELL AND LIBBY  It is now three years since 2,000 farmworkers walked out of the Ohio tomato  fields in a strike against Campbell Soup  Co. and Libby, McNeill, Libby. The strike  has been joined by hundreds of other  workers over the past two harvest seasons,  but the strike fund is depleted. Do not  buy Campbell or Libby products.  MAGGIO  The United Farm Workers are still urging  a boycott of Maggio carrots, Garden Prize  carrots, and Red Coach iceberg lettuce in  an attempt to force the company to give  its workers a fair contract. More than  350 UFW members have been on strike  against the California company since  January, 1979.  CHILE  To force the Chilean government to admit  to, and terminate, all human rights violations in that country, a general boycott  of all Chilean products Is urged.  CANADA DRY AND PEPSI  Canada Dry workers have called for the  support of the labour movement following  the closure of Canada Dry's Montreal plant.  The union has only 48 members and is an  affiliate of the United Steelworkers.  They, along with the Quebec Federation of  Labour and the Canadian Labour Congress  have called for the boycott of Canada Dry  products. After the plant shut down  Pepsi-Cola was given the franchise to continue bottling and distributing Canada Dry  beverages, so the union is recommending  that they be boycotted at the same time.  IRWIN  Following the arrest of four workers on a  picket line outside of a warehouse owned  by Irwin Toys Ltd., the United Steelworkers  called for a nationwide boycott of Irwin's  products. Most of the workers at Irwin  Toys are women working at the minimum  wage with no seniority rights or sick pay  rights.  Irwin Toys products include Atari electronic games, Ideal toys, Kenner products and  Tyco electric trains. Q 30    Kinesis    December/January 1982  MOVEMENT MATTERS  BCFW convention notes  The B.C. Federation of Women convention in  November covered some important ground in  terms of structural changes and policy.  The next issue of Kinesis will contain a  full report. Meanwhile, some announcements:  * The childcare equipment collected for  the convention is available on loan to  other women's groups. Call Jenny at 879-  7980 for more information.  * Sherry McCarnan is acting as Convention  Lost & Found. Call her at 872-5847.  * BCFW Constitution and Policy Handbooks  which are not being used (whatever year  they be) should be sent to BCFW c/o Box  24687, Stn. C, Vancouver V5T 4E2. Handbooks  are in very short supply, as always, and  some re-distribution would be helpful.  * This year's first Regional Meeting will  be held Tuesday, December 15, 7:30pm at  Makara, 1011 Commercial Drive, Vancouver.  This meeting is for representatives of  BCFW member groups. A regional rep to the  coordinating committee will be elected from  this meeting.  Press Gang needs workers  A paid position is available at Press Gang  Printers and Publishers. The job combines  bookkeeping, litho-prep, and bindery work.  We would prefer to hire a woman with  previous experience in any (or all) these  areas, but we will do training. An ability to work collectively, and a commitment to feminism are equally important.  Phone 253-1224 for more details, or come  down and fill in an application.  Experience first hand the joys of inky clothes!  Press Gang is soliciting women volunteers  to work on a regular part-time basis in  both printing and publishing aspects of  the collective.  Printing:    We need women to help in the  day-to-day operations of the print shop:  stripping negatives, burning plates,  stitching booklets, layout, etc.  If you  are experienced, wonderful.  If not, we  will undertake to teach the essential  skills in a series of evening workshops  (contingent to attracting the required  number of women). We would then expect a  commitment of at least a day (or evening)  of work per week, for about a year.  Publishing:    We are interested in women  who will work with us to develop our  publishing program.  This involves the  soliciting and appraisal of manuscripts,  editing, office shit-work, promotion,  layout, etc. Again, experience is a definite asset, but not essential. Agreement  on a basic political perspective will be  required.  Contact the Press at 253-1224 for more  information.  The B.C.-Nicaragua Women's Support  Group raffle to support AMNLAE has  been quite successful. We hope to  surpass our goal of $2000. The final  draw is on Friday, December 11 at an  informal tea at Vancouver Status of  Women, from 5-6pm. For more info,  call Katherine Pearson at 736-1717.  Equal pay remains a  'hot issue'  The Equal Pay Information Committee is an  ad hoc group of civic and school board  workers attempting to keep the equal pay  for work of equal value issue alive.  Concerned that a proper settlement had not  been reached at the end of the civic worker's strike the group has sponsored information meetings with speakers from various  trade unions and are asking questions at  all-candidates' meetings.  The committee  believes that equal pay will continue to  be a 'hot issue' in their 1982 contract  negotiations, according to Aphrodite Harris,  a clerical worker.  Harris points out that the base (entry) rate  for a custodial worker in the School Board  is over $3.22 an hour higher than the entry  rate for a clerical worker, pointing up  some of the differences between so-called  'inside and outside' work.  The committee refers to the fundamental  principle as "equalizaton of base rates".  This phrase bypasses the confusion generated by definitions of'inside and outside'  or by determining the value of a secretary';  work as opposed to a custodian's work.  Recently the committee drafted a short  questionnaire for municipal and school  candidates to determine their stand on the  equal pay issue.  Graham Leslie, head of  Labour Relations at the G.V.R.D. and chief  negotiator in the civic strike,undertook  to provide some forewarning of the questionnaire to all municipal mayors, and presumably their candidates, by sending them  a copy of the questionnaire complete with  his suggested responses should they need  them!  For info call Aphrodite Harris at 987-5339  Matronize!! Matronize!!  Tired of patronising high-gloss department stores during the holiday season?

The .selection this year will represent  local artists and craftswomen from a wide  variety of disciplines: sculpture, prints,  oils, water colour, drawings, ceramics,  and fabrics.  The Grand Opening of the sale is Friday,  December 4 at 8 p.m. Matronize   '81  will  run until December 24, 9:30 - 5 p.m.  weekdays, .on Saturdays from 12-5 p.m., and  Wednesday evenings until 9 p.m.  Rape Relief seeks community pledges for safe house  Vancouver Rape Relief is pleased and  proud to announce the purchase of a  house that will serve as a residence, a  safe shelter for women and a centre for  organizing women against sexist violence.  Vancouver Rape Relief is a feminist collective of fifteen women allying with  other groups towards a classless, and  anti-racist society, but focusing our  work primarily on the liberation of  women. This house is one strategy within  that framework for supplying concrete  aid to victims of sexist oppression —  women who have been battered, raped,  harassed — and for organizing against  that oppression.  The purchase of this house is a result of  two and a half year's work on the part of  the women in the Rape Relief collective  and on the part of the women and men on  the Rape Relief funding committee who,  together, have raised $85,000.00 in two  years.  This money has come from feminist  collectives, unions, community groups,  housing co-ops, worker co-ops and many  supportive individuals.  We have deliberately sought community  funding for this house because it will  minimize government control and that inde  pendence will better enable us to serve  and organize women, to support each other  in our choices, to let people know the  extent of violence against women and to  organize against it.  Women interested in helping with :  tions are welcome weekends and Sunday  nights.  Call 872-8212.

Address   Phone   1 wish to make an ongoing pledge towards the purchase and operation of the Rape Relief House  . (date).  Since the Oct. 1 move of Rape Relief  offices into the house, our crisis and  business number is 872-8212, 24 hours a  day, seven days a week. Although the  house is not yet officially open, as much  renovation is necessary, there are already  women and children residing there.  The purchase and renovation of the house  only begin the continuing process of making  this particular strategy a workable one.  There is much still to do and we continue  to need your help and support:  more, we need your support for the operating expenses.  Whatever you can afford will be helpful.  Please send us a series of postdated  cheques payable to Rape Relief Housefund-  ing.  This is helpful for our paperwork  and people usually find it easier than  remembering and sending a separate cheque  each month.  Donations are tax-deductible;  receipts will be issued.  If you are considering making a pledge and need more  information, phone Rape Relief at 872-8212. December/January 1982    Kinesis    3  LETTERS  Where were feminists when  domestic workers rallied?  Today I went to the rally in support of  domestic workers' demand for landed immigrant status.  The vulnerability and slave labour conditions of domestic workers have been covered  in detail in past issues of Kinesis. We've  all had the politics of housework being  unpaid shitwork, for years. Everyone knows  that our privileged lifestyle continues on  the backs of third world people, both here  and in the third world. There's no need for  me to go into detail about why feminists  should have been at the rally.  WHERE WERE YOU? I've seen more women I recognize as feminists in Joe's on a Sunday  afternoon. The only time I've been this  shocked at a poor feminist turnout was at  the benefit for Daphne Williams, the domestic worker waging an absolutely heroic  battle against the Canadian government's  exploitative immigration policies.  It's racist that feminists don't support  domestic workers' struggle. It's racism  that prevents white women from seeing that  links between immigrant women's oppression  and our own are strong enough that benefits  and rallies in support of these women have  to be high priority.  The growth of the women's movement will be  limited as long as it's white-focused,  white-populated, white-controlled. We all  lose out by not supporting third women's  struggle.  In sisterhood,  Penny Thompson  Notes from an older sister  Kinesis:  Ms. Brown, the raggedy Imoon (plural Wemoon  - her word, not mine), would like us all to  become weavers, washers, and wearers between the legs, of "multipurpose bits of  cloth", i.e. rags, the name of which has,  she tells us, "ancient significance".  Despite the fascinating drawing, worthy of  a grade five guidance class booklet, of  what appears to be a gussied up chastity  belt, and the explicit directions for use  with, for example, "an elaborate macrame  cord in lavender and pink satin with beads"  - no worries about underwear lines here -  I remain unconvinced of either the efficacy, the economy or the aesthetic pleasure  Ms. Brown's method of "dealing with menstrual blood". For the following reasons,  leaked and cozed from what the feminist  literary critics call the authority of  experience:  Eleeding sisters, take it from me, the rag  is a drag. Around my thirteenth birthday,  when I was still in a state of shock at the  sight of my own blood, my mother tore a  piece of bed sheet, "used and loved for  years" and previously ripped from end to  end by my brother's sharp toenail, folded  it without benefit of a diagram, pinned it  back and front to my liberty bodice (a  garment of ancient significance), and informed me I would have to wear a facsimile  of this rudimentary soaker for five days of  every month for forty years.  Ye Goddesses! (to update the favourite expletive of my brilliant, harried, thoroughly oppressed and now deceased mother).  For three years I ripped, folded, washed,  boiled, and hung on the back yard clothesline, the signs of my monthly issue, whence  they offered mute evidence to the neighbourhood of my continuing non-gravid and  presumably virginal state.  •AcUavrfj*.  oiotyv    /rCca.(cat ■  fyoit~     u>tMy^J    snaUL   poiwhj.  a>  Au£ you.  f\     <f  c/   uxU  <  ^ D  don't    ILChju        \  srxxZL   poiioh,     /--*  ll  At sixteen, when I got my first pay packet,  I rushed out and blew the lot on a box of  the cumbersome, bulky, blessedly disposable  pads, with nary a thought of my contribution either to the depletion of the forests  or to the development of capitalism.  I feel certain that the moment the forest  companies decide that sanitary pads are not  a profitable product, they will launch "a  massive advertising campaign to convince  women (and wemoon) that rags are the rage.  The major department stores will then feature crocheted, embroidered and jewelled  versions complete with matching belt and  pins, co-ordinated carrying case, special  soap and suitable perfume. Until then I  feel entitled to the use of a few trees.  After all, I'm saving all that hot water  and cutting down on the profits of the  local laundromat and the Maytag company.  In addition, along with copies of articles  from Kinesis such as Ms. Brown's, the used  disposables will make a good fire once a  month, save energy and reduce the hydro  bill.       " ,  .  ,,  Hysterically yours,  Patricia Maika  "Brother Hubbard'' reports  on Carpenters' convention  Kinesis:  I attended the annual convention of the  provincial council of carpenters as a  delegate last month, thereby becoming the  first B.C. woman ever elected to represent  a carpentry local (527 of Nanaimo).  I  was also appointed to the human rights  and women's rights committees along with  seven others (three of whom were women  from allied locals).  The four days of convention were very  interesting as well as exhausting. Resolutions were submitted on a wide area  of topics, including the trade union  movement in other countries, interest  rates, occupational health and safety,  disarmament and the trade union movement,  and women's rights.  Most delegates were interested in seeing  more women in the trades and supported  resolutions recommending:  • that trade schools stress the un-  acceptability of sexual harassment in  course curricula and in school operating  procedures;  • that training about sexual harassment  be included in the job stewards course,  and a membership education campaign be  undertaken which incorporates a clearly  defined grievance procedure in cases of  sexual harassment;  • that the provincial council of carpenters pledge continuing access to  training for future women carpenters and  help to eliminate existing obstacles  (action on this resolution began with  participation in the Manpower Training  Cutbacks forum);  • that negotiating committees insist  on the elimination of all sexist language  in collective agreements.  A resolution on maternity leave was presented (with a comment on paternity leave)  but the majority of delegates quivered at  the thought of spending money out of the  health and welfare budget. We'll work  more on that one next year.  Towards the end of the convention I spoke  of my needs as a woman carpenter to the  five other delegates from my local.  I  asked them to support me at the convention, on the job site, and at local meetings.  I asked that they interrupt sexism  wherever it occurred, and understand that  I was interested in friendship and not  sexual contact. What I forgot to ask, in  my nervousness, was that they share their  skills and experience with me!  They were interested in what I had to  say and wanted to talk more about my concerns at the local level.  My local brothers' positive response to  my specific concerns, along with the mostly  favourable response from delegates to  women's issues, left me feeling hopeful  and enthusiastic about my participation  in the union.  As a postscript, I have been elected by  my local to represent the carpenters union  in the November 21 rally in Ottawa protesting high interest rates.
