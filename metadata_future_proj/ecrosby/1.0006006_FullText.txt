Array Hamilton Feb.27th 1874    My dear Mother,   I cannot tell you how glad I was to get your letter Wednesday evening - thank you very, very much for writing so promptly.  I know it is hard for you and there seems to be so little time to think about it and get used to the idea.  I could wish that this were different - but I feel sure that all will be right, however it may seem now - I believe firmly that a blessing will rest upon my life, and I do hope you and my father will feel that there is nothing to fear.  I shall be taken care of wherever I am.   Then I think, dear Mamma, that you have an exaggerated idea of the privations to be undergone, if so you like to call them.  I shall likely have a comfortable enough home and all that is necessary to my happiness.  Mr. Crosby was here last night and, dear Mamma, we settled it then - it was not wrong, was it?  You know the time is so short and it was not right for either of us to leave it undecided.  Till the early part of May will likely be the longest we can stay, though it is just possible we may remain till after Conference.  I told Dr. Rice about it today.  He spoke very kindly indeed, without discouraging it at all and promises to relieve me as soon as it is possible to do so.  I shall need all the time I can get for preparation.  I should like to be with you in two or three weeks if I could.   Tell Auntie about it if you think best.  I do not want it talked about any more than is necessary but I do not suppose it would be possible to keep it a secret.  Mr. Crosby sends kind regards & will see you as soon as he can.  Write again soon.  With truest love to yourself and my father.   Believe me, dear Mother,    Ever your affectionate daughter,     Emma.
