Array Fort Simpson B.C.  May 14th 1880    My dear Mother,   I can just scribble a line as I lie in bed to tell you that another sweet little daughter was born to us two days ago, on the 12th.  Not a very large baby but very strong & well.  Thomas had just reached home the afternoon of the 11th with Jessie, after a most prosperous four weeks visit away.  Jessie had had a delightful time and seems improved in every way. I have done remarkably well - was sick only about two hours and am feeling quite strong.   I am very sorry to hear of your being so feeble but I do hope you may get some relief.  We have received Papa's letter.  With love to all dear Mother from,   Your daughter,    Emma
