Array 2631 First Ave West<br> Vancouver July 10/20<br>Dear Grace <br> I looked confidently for another letter from you by this time, but as there is none and it is Saturday afternoon I will write without waiting longer.  Do not forget your own suggestion to write twice a week.  Well I hope and wish you are getting on comfortably & happily.  You probably do not feel the heat much more than you would have done here the last few days.  It has been unusually warm - up to 88 & a fraction one day.  As for one I have not felt at all uncomfortable.  I think I will go over to Jessie's early next week, so address further letters there.  I have quite enjoyed myself and they have taken the best of care of me but Helen still has a good deal of "settling" to do and ought to have a clear chance to get on with it.  Then Marian has had her tonsils removed - it was done on Thursday, and she was back home next day, but I suppose she will be somewhat shut in for a while & perhaps she & I can be company for each other.  I am keeping very well I am thankful to say and may be good for something yet.  I hope you are getting along as well.  You will probably be surprised to hear that "Mrs. Earnest" Bollert has a little son born yesterday in the Gen. Hospital.  She has been very ill indeed but we hope she may soon be well on the way to recovery.  They have been very anxious about her.  Florence intends I think to go east sometime next week and then Grace and her father are to make their home here with Helen for a time at least.  There is so much room in this house and it is really very pleasant and cheerful.
