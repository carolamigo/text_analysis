Array Fort Simpson, B.C.  June 8th 1876    My dear Mother,   I have only a few minutes in which to write.  I had got all ready to go down to Victoria this   trip and meant to write you from there but I find the str. is likely to be a long time on the way this   trip, so I decided not to go.  Indeed I can scarcely see my way clear to leave as things are now.    Thomas has work and worry enough without taking any more - and to tell the truth I don't like the idea   of going away alone.  Jessie is very well and I should take a little girl to nurse her - but I am pretty   sure I should be homesick.  Our pet has improved lately very much.  We have her out a great deal.  She   is very fond of walking about but does not go alone yet.  She has eight teeth now, including two double   teeth and has got them without any apparent trouble.  The constipation has left her altogether.  She is   such a gay little blossom!  I wish I could tell you all the good things Thomas brought home when he came   - oranges and canned tomatoes & canned meat, and preserved fruit from a friend, and fresh meat and   vegetables.  You can get pretty much anything you want in Victoria for money - and Thomas say he will   get these things.  Would Papa be so kind as to see this account settled at the Book Room and get the   receipts - and also to renew Thomas' subscription for the Weekly Globe which has run out.   Our united love to our father and mother,   Your affectionate daughter    Emma
