Array Kindest love to my dear father & yourself, Sallie & Auntie, and Believe me, dear Mother, <br>   Yours with truest affection<br>    Emma<br><br>    Hamilton<br>  March 9th 1874<br>    My dear Mother,<br>   I was so glad to get your letter Saturday.  I fancied from its tone that you were beginning to look more happily on my future - was I wrong, mother dear!  I feel so sure it will all be right.  I wish you could see it as I do.  About prolonging our stay -  I do not know that it would be best even could it be done, which is doubtful.  I would not urge it myself.  I will explain why when I see you.  There is a lady here already who is to take my work - and tomorrow will be my last day in the school.   It will be well for me, I think to remain ten days longer in the college.  I want time to say good-bye to everyone - and to give out some dress-making - that gray silk might as well be made up, I suppose and I want to get a black one.  I can get it at wholesale price and both had better be made here.  I shall keep myself supplied with work as long as I am here.  I scarcely see how everything is to be got ready but mean to manage it somehow or other.  I wrote to Susie to know if George could meet me in Toronto so that I could get there pretty much all I want. Will you let me know Mamma, what you think I will want most, and what resources I may expect to have to draw upon, if I get knives & forks or anything of that kind.  I might get them in Toronto - better than elsewhere.  Thank Auntie & Sallie for their kind offer of help.  I think I shall make most of my preparations in Barrie.  Will you write immediately, Mamma, please, and let me know what you think about all these things.
