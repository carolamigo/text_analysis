Array 1200 Barclay St. Vancouver Aug. 25/20<br> Dear Grace <br> I mailed a letter last evening & now have yours of 20th.  A hasty line before the mail is gathered.  If you do not reach here till Wed. that will be Sept. 1st. Will your tickets hold good?  Then you remember when Jessie &c came that way the train did not get in till morning.  Of course Auntie & I could be in the house and you might be on time.  Let me know in time what you decide.  All well.  Love.<br>  Mother
