Array Victoria, B.C.        June 25th 1874          My dear Mother,        It may be a good while before I have another chance of sending you a letter so I had better write today.  Tomorrow morning, five A.M. the "Otter" is announced to leave for the North to have, all being well, the Fort S. missionary and his wife on board her.  If she leaves so early we shall likely sleep on board ship.  Then we begin in earnest - but we are both hopeful and happy.  I shall be the only lady passenger of course - it is chiefly miners on their way to the gold fields on the Stickeen river who go on this route - however, the Captain, I believe, is very agreeable - he is a H.B. officer and we will likely be very comfortable.        We remained a few days after the camp meeting at Chilliwhack.  We received so much kindness there, as indeed we have wherever we have been, that I really felt quite attached to both the place and the people.  Over sixty dollars was collected and presented to Mr. Crosby before we left the camp meeting.  Then there is a farmer there who says he promised that whenever Thomas married he would give Mrs. C. a cow, and declares his readiness now to send it to Fort S. any time or if we cannot keep one there to send butter instead.  I got to be quite in love with riding.  Did I tell you about a little horse Thomas has there, a fine spirited horse but quite gentle?  I had one splendid ride on him.  If there was any use for a horse and any way of keeping on[e] at Fort S. we would have this but I scarcely think there will be enough use for him to make it worth while.  Thomas wants to take him up for me to ride if he can but I don' suppose I should have much time for that. We spent a week at New Westminster on our way down the Fraser, making our home at the Parsonage with Mr. and Mrs. Russ.  They were so very kind.  Mrs. R. was as affectionate with me as a sister could be.  Offered even to take care of us in case of illness if I would go to her and I know she would do it in a kind Christian spirit.  We remained longer than we had intended there.  Thomas was completely tired out and it was a good place to rest.  I think I know pretty nearly all the Methodists of the place now - besides some others.  One lady there had a large box of bottled fruit put up for us before we left.          We reached Victoria again Saturday afternoon last.  As a little Hall had been added to the family at the Parsonage a week before, we could not stay there of course, so we are guests of a Mr. Trounce.   The house is a very handsome one with a beautiful garden.  The family are somewhat peculiar.  There are no children - just four elderly people, two sisters and their husbands.  They are painfully particular in their house keeping.  Mrs. T. makes it a point to see that no soiled boots enter.  Did you clean your boots? is an inquiry frequently addressed to visitors.  She always says just what she thinks regardless alike of politeness and other people's feelings.  "Get off that chair, no one is allowed to sit there but me" were almost the first words she addressed to Thomas after we came.  Fortunately she does not mind one??s laughing - it has been impossible for me to keep my gravity sometimes.  Temperance is a hobby with her.  Her husband I like very much indeed, they are all as kind as they can be to us.  A lot of fruit - preserved - is being put up for us to take to our new home.  So you see I shall have quite a lot of fruit to begin with.  They say too that wild fruit is very plentiful there so I hope we shall get on nicely.        Miss Pollard and Mrs. Hall, too, the other day gave me for a wedding present, I suppose, a silver gravy ladle, a couple of knife rests and two napkin rings - all very pretty.  We have been very busy this week, Thomas especially, arranging plans for the future, and buying furniture &c.  It is mostly through now, though.  We have all we need to make us comfortable and make the house pleasant except one or two things we may have to send down for again - wait till we get settled then I will, all being well, give you a full description.  The freight we had such a time packing arrived last week, apparently in excellent condition, and will go on with us.  I do not know yet how long it may be before we are in our own house.  It may be we shall use one of the Company's till spring next if we can be comfortable - and the church be built first.  Or if the house is put up first as I hope it will be, we shall likely stay in the meantime in a couple of rooms in the Fort.  For a few days it is likely we will stay with the family of the H.B. officer in charge.  We are taking up a few groceries with us - baking powder &c.  Indeed as a grocer here wishes to present us with ten dollars we may take it all out in groceries.  Almost everything, they say, we can get at the Fort.   So you see, Mother dear, that thus far our way has been blessed, and we have every reason to feel encouraged.  I did not get your letters till Saturday.  They had some of them been waiting some time.  There was one from Annie too.  It seemed so good to hear from you.  I hope we shall have more today.  There will likely be a mail in and perhaps we shall have no other for a month.  Our address will be Fort Simpson.  The mail is sent on from the office here.  I suppose Papa is back from the Conference by this time.  I am anxious to hear some news from it - and more anxious to know what your plans are for the coming year.   Love to Auntie and Sallie, I will write to both of them as soon as I can.  And now, Mother, do not feel uneasy about me.  I am taken good care of and have been well.  It is wonderful to me how quiet and trustful I have been kept.  "Not unto us" be the praise.  Thomas would write again now  but he really has so much to do it is impossible.  He joins me in truest love to yourself and my father.  Write often, dear Mother, and pray for,   Your affectionate daughter,    Emma
