Array Will send more money soon.  Let me know what you need.<br><br> 1200 Barclay St. Vancouver July 29/20<br>Dear Grace<br> I am afraid I am late with my letter this time but your last was rather behind and that put me off.  How little it takes to keep one busy when there is nothing particular to keep one right up to the mark.  I think it will do me good to get right into harness again as I hope to do when we get home again.  We have been having some company of late too & of course that takes time.  Sunday afternoon after an auto ride with them Jessie had the Bull family for afternoon tea which these warm days is served on the verandah.  While they were here a phone message said Dr & Mrs Stephenson of Toronto were in the city and they accepted an invitation to come up, so tea was served again to them.  We found that Mr & Mrs Forster (artist) had come out with them & were at the Vancouver.  Bob & Jessie went to church with the Stephensons & there met the Forsters & invited them for a drive Sunday & tea.  So we all went round the Marine Drive - it was a lovely day - and then back for tea to the verandah where Dr Wilson was awaiting us.  He knew the Aikins family in Winnipeg.  Then Sunday afternoon Jessie had another function.  Miss Edge & Miss Malkin leave in a few days for England, so they were here for a farewell visit & a few others to meet them.  Mrs Forster was here also.  Yesterday a cousin of Bob's, Mrs H(?) was here for dinner.  The Stephensons & Forsters are [on] their way to Japan & China to (?) the missions and Mr Forster to do artist work, and expect to spend some months away.  Several others from Toronto are to join them on the boat.  We enjoyed Mrs Forster very much - she is so genial and nice.  Of course I knew her long ago and so did Aunt Annie.  Mr Forster has aged a good deal but otherwise is not much changed. Tomorrow morning Jessie & Marian leave for Sechelt for two weeks or more.  Bob will probably spend some little time there too before they return.  In the meantime Auntie & I will be here with Emma.  We expect a good quick free time.  Harold & Helen are not going to get away on their trip this week.  Harold could not go - but may do so later.  Tuesday was Baby's birthday.  Auntie & I went out in the forenoon with some little gifts.  Auntie had a pretty new sweater for her.  The floor staining I think can be managed without difficulty.  I could sleep at Harold's if I wanted to be out of the way as I probably should, and Auntie could stay here till things were settled.  We shall see, and in the meantime do not worry about anything.  I am glad to know you get on so well.  With much love as ever Mother.
