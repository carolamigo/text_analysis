Array Making a start in Canada MAKING A START IN CANADA LETTERS FROM TWO TOUNG EMIGRANTS WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ALFRED J CHURCH M A Professor of Latin in University College London LONDON SEELEY CO ESSEX STREET STRAND 1889 INTRODUCTION Many young men of what is commonly called the upper middle class yearly leave their country to seek fortune or to put the case more modestly subsistence in Canada It has occurred to me having recently sent two sons to that country to publish some extracts from the letters in which they have described their experience and to say something about their preparations for this undertaking Many parents will be glad I imagine to know how their sons should be equipped and what is the sort of life which they actually lead My two sons then when they left England VI Introduction for Canada were aged respectively eighteen years one month and sixteen years nine months and were both strong and well grown I mention this because many lads at the age of the younger of the two are quite unfit for the work which as will be seen fell upon them This lad was nearly as tall as his brother five feet eleven inches and almost his match in strength As the two were very closely attached to each other and I looked for much advantage to both from their continued companionship I did not like to separate them Otherwise I should say that it would not be well to send out so young a lad They had been educated in the ordinary way at a Grammar School and for a short time before their departure at University College London I can hardly say that any attempt had been made to specialize their education Indeed the idea of emigrating though long cherished by them did not take 1 Introduction vii any definite shape till but a few weeks before it was carried into execution If it had I am not sure whether I should have cared to divert their attention from their general instruction Still I do not doubt that if they had realized the probability of their going to a country where both the French and German languages are spoken they might have applied themselves with more diligence to these studies When it had been determined that they should go they attended at the college a course of lectures on practical geology I very much regret that their teaching in this most valuable and interesting subject extended over so brief a time Of matters that were likely to be practically useful they learnt at home some simple operations in cooking for instance how to make a suet pudding to boil potatoes and to make bread They received instruction from a shoemaker and under his supervision heeled soled Vlll Introduction and patched boots They also learnt how to mend a rent in a coat and to darn a hole in a stocking I am told and I can well believe that they lost much by missing what they might easily have got and what is indeed within the reach of most lads some practical instruction in farriery There was a forge close to their home where they might have learnt how to shoe horses and acquired some elementary knowledge of the ordinary diseases of the animal and of the remedies with which they are treated If more time had been available they might have attended classes at the Veterinary College I am given to understand that even a very moderate skill in the veterinary art will be found one of the most profitable attainments that a lad can acquire They had the advantage of using a workshop belonging to a kind friend and neighbour Here they had acquired some skill in carpentering enough to enable them in a rude 6 Introduction ix kind of way to set up and even to construct their own beehives When it was settled that they were to go they received some practical instruction from a skilled carpenter They helped him to fence a field and to construct a wooden cow house and they worked under his supervision for some days at various miscellaneous jobs The lads had for several years before their departure lived in the country if one of the remoter suburbs of London can be called country Here they had learnt something about gardening and especially about the pruning of fruit trees They had kept pigs which they managed themselves and they had also in a small way been bee masters When the plan of emigration was matured they attended the first course of lectures given by the Ambulance Association having for its subject First Aid in Cases of Accident It x Introduction is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this point I should strongly advise all parents to insist upon their sons acquiring some elementary knowledge of what should be done in an emergency before the arrival of professional aid often long delayed as one may easily imagine in a thinly populated country I say insist because they will probably find them unwilling or contemptuous as my sons certainly were Young people seem to count upon an immunity from accident a delusion which their elders should not suffer to prevent them from acquiring the knowledge necessary for dealing with it in its first and most urgent needs There is no necessity for pointing out how often health or life may be saved by presence of mind guided by ever so little acquaintance with elementary medical facts When I add that the lads had received some lessons in riding they had not had it will have been seen Introduction xi that thorough country breeding of which riding is a necessary part but that they were not so expert as they might advantageously have been I have said enough on this part of my subject They took with them fishing rods and tackle I should particularly recommend under this head a good stock of artificial bait In choosing a rod particular care should be taken that the wood should be suitable to the climate with its extremes of heat and cold and especially its dryness The tackle should not be too fine They had also each a gun it was a twelve bore sporting gun one barrel choke the other cylinder They had a box of games and a small chest with various medical appliances of the most necessary kind The list of the outfit which the two lads took with them is as follows it must be remembered that they started their life in a Xll Introduction gentleman s house and therefore wanted some things which might not in every case be required Dress suit Best tweed suit Tennis suit One cloth suit of leather suiting Extra trousers of ditto The three suits that they had in wear Two pairs of corduroy trousers Ulster coat Pea jacket Mackintosh Dressing gown useful as an extra warm garment Twelve flannel shirts Two white shirts Four pyjamas of flannel Four pairs winter and summer drawers Four vests Twenty four pairs of socks Six collars the flannel shirts being furnished with collars Introduction xiii White cravats and cuffs Cardigan Two jerseys Twelve pocket handkerchiefs some coarse coloured handkerchiefs might be obtained in Canada Six Turkish towels Waterproof sheet should be large and of the best quality Blankets should be an undivided pair of large size and thick Rug I Six pairs of dress gloves Three hedging and ditching ditto Two pair Canada mittens A housewife with buttons needles etc of all kinds saddlery needles included One pair of high boots others can be bought in Canada Pair of boots Dress shoes Pair of shoes not nailed Pair of slippers Ambulance braces Helmet of Jager wool XIV Introduction Cholera belt Trunk which should be of a manageable size An indiarubber bath should have been added and some coarse cotton shirts Portmanteau for cabin I must express my hearty thanks to Mr A G Bradley 22 Great George Street Westminster by whose means my sons were settled in their first home I think that I may mention the names of the two tradesmen who supplied the outfit in a manner that has given satisfaction both here and in Canada they have gained considerable experience in finding out what is really suitable for the needs of young men thus emigrating Mr C T Merryweather tailor and outfitter Bridgegate East Retford Mr F T Clark bootmaker same address It should be especially remembered that pieces for repair of garments should be sent Introduction xv out also all old clothes available should be included And let everything be made large I may say that the total cost of outfit voyage and maintenance of the two lads for the first year also of taking up and stocking land has been less than 500 It may be done for a much smaller sum A J C CONTENTS PART I ONTARIO

 I Our New Home The First Week s Work A few Birds June 1886 On Saturday we left Toronto by the mid day train arriving here a few minutes before six The country through which we passed was quite different to that between Montreal and Quebec There were still large forests but the fields looked more cultivated and we saw lots of large orchards We saw Lake Sincoe and in the distance Barrie This is a splendid place with a sort of rambling old farmhouse a large garden and orchard and lots of vines The fruit has all done blossoming and is forming fast The farm is chiefly arable there are only about fifty head 1 2 4 Our New Home of cattle and a few horses The birds here are rather peculiar A robin is about as big as a thrush blackbirds and canaries are flying about in plenty There are also plenty of mosquitoes but I have only been bitten once and that hardly itched at all I enclose a mosquito Mr and Mrs B are very nice people indeed The family consists of two sons and three daughters We could not get our big trunk which the porters at Euston christened the Woolwich Infant into the house for some time At last one of the doors was taken down and then we managed it We began work on Monday at six This work was loading manure from the barn yard into waggons which were then drawn out to the fields a waggon being always waiting to be filled This was continued till eight when we went in to breakfast breakfast consisted of fresh meat tea bread and butter and fruit After breakfast we went to the The First Week s Work 5 potato pits to cut up potatoes for seed the potatoes had to be cut into pieces containing one or two eyes the juice stains the hands very much and we found it almost impossible to wash it off during the day soap only making it worse This work was kept on till twelve when we returned to the house for dinner consisting of roast mutton potatoes beans and pudding After dinner we planted potatoes till six we had to plant each seed potato by itself along a furrow and being kept in a stooping posture the whole time our backs soon began to ache At six we had a tea of bread and butter stewed fruit and tea after tea we went into the garden and worked at getting the tennis lawn into o o order When it became dark we went into the house and played whist till ten o clock when we had a supper of bread and butter and milk and then went to bed The next morning after the usual Tumble up boys at our door we started on the 6 The First Week s Work same work and indeed kept it up just the same every day till Friday all the potatoes being then sown On Friday morning we followed a plough on some quite new ground our portion of the work being to make the sods stop in the places into which the plough turned them this had to be done with our hands and as the sods were frequently of considerable length and size and very stiff it was no easy job and very exasperating when after a frantic struggle to push a sod three or four feet long out of the furrow you saw it slowly roll back into its former position We had also to help the man at the plough to clear it of roots of which there were plenty altogether one had to be pretty lively to keep up with the plough We left off at eight to go to breakfast after breakfast we did odd jobs such as helping to harness the horses and to fix up fences After dinner we dug weeds in the fields till tea at six after tea we went along A Few Birds 7 the stream and shot a few birds and came in at dark to play whist On Saturday we got up at six and fetched the cows in and then watched them being milked till eight when we had breakfast After breakfast we worked in the garden digging and spreading manure till twelve After dinner we went along the creek with our guns and shot some chipmunks a woodpecker and bee bird getting back about half past four About ten that night there was an alarm that the colts had got on to the railway track we went out with one of the men to try and find them but could not do so As we then heard that there would be no more trains till Monday morning we did not trouble any further About half an hour later the boss came home and we helped to put away his horses and rig June Herbert and I went out shooting in 8 A Few Birds the bush the other day He shot an eye holder a bee bird and a chipmunk and I shot two chipmunks An eyeholder is a bird with a large beak like a woodpecker a red mark on its head and a black one on its breast Its wings underneath are a bright orange It is a splendid looking bird When it is properly cured we will send the skin to you The eye bird is small with a black back white breast and a crest of orange red Chipmunks are little brown squirrels with dark stripes on their backs Yesterday we were sent out to chop down weeds some distance off We bird nested at the same time but we only found some young swallows in the hole of a tree There is a large kingfisher here which we have tried to shoot but we have not succeeded yet as it never settles We manage now to make our cartridges fairly well The tennis court has now been marked out and we are going to challenge the B Club near here as soon as we have had some A Few Birds 9 practice The mosquitoes have become perfectly awful They make for my hands when I am asleep They do not touch my face but sometimes they bite my neck I have about thirty bites on each hand and as many on each of my feet Socks are no protection at all they manage to get through even the thickest We get up about six o clock and bathe in the mill pond which is about twelve feet deep in the middle On Sundays we have not much to do and come down about eight Altogether it is a very jolly life though the work is hard We have however plenty to eat and as much time to ourselves as we want There are plenty of places round about with any quantity of fish but I have not tried yet as the fish in the stream are only very small 
 II Life at the Farm Work and Play Haying Before the Harvest June We had a tremendous thunderstorm here a few days ago The rain came down in great sheets and in a few minutes the road was turned into a stream six or eight inches deep We managed to get into shelter just before it came on On Friday afternoon we went to a garden party nine miles off There were six of us in a democrat a four wheeled vehicle with two seats one behind the other The roads were very bad and one or two hills were so steep that we had to walk up and going down had to hold on to keep the rig from overrunning the horses It took Life at the Farm 11 three hours to do nine miles We got home again about half past nine A lawn tennis match was to have been played against a neighbouring club but the rain prevented it The strawberries have been on for some time now The other day Mr B took a hundred quarts to market I am now learning to milk At first I took half an hour to half milk a single cow Every morning Dick goes to bring the cows in while I have to water and groom the driving horse and sometimes one or two colts if they have been used and to clean out their stalls before breakfast This morning when I took Tiny to the creek and was riding bareback with a rope round his neck he took it into his head to get excited and canter along the road and as I was not able to stop him not having a bridle I simply let him go and held on tight After breakfast this morning we had to go and head some steers and got back about half past one 12 Life at the Farm I can harness a pair of horses and put them in a rig now almost without a mistake The canaries here fly about in flocks just as sparrows with you and there are some splendid butterflies and humming birds Three days ago we began taking in the hay here the work is not at all unpleasant but rather hard We had breakfast at six a m dinner at twelve tea in the field or lawn supper at nine Yesterday we went on working till nine so as to be able to have a picnic to morrow up the mountain I was awfully glad to get to bed but was all right this morning I was down at ten just in time for breakfast as I did not have to fetch the cows in at six as usual Of course everywhere people have to work late with the hay when there is fear of rain and there is a certain amount of fun in hurrying it in as those in the field try to put on the loads so as to race those who are unloading at the barn This is really very exciting I have Life at the Farm 13 been at the barn stowing the hay away as it is brought The weather is delightful not too warm with a cool breeze from the lake though a few days ago it was awfully hot 96 in the shade The mosquitoes are gradually disappearing and that is a good thing Sundays here are very jolly as there is no work to do except occasionally to herd cattle and that cannot be called work as we sit in a shady place and read and have a dog to look after the beasts July As you may like to have a more accurate account of our work here is an extract from my diary Saturday Up at six a m Watered and groomed Tiny and cleaned out his stable milked two cows and fed the calves They eat like little pigs At eight breakfast After breakfast harnessed Tiny to the buggy Life at the Farm fetched the sheep down for one to be killed and then took them back After dinner herded cattle up beyond the old farm There were heaps of wild strawberries and raspberries Brought the cattle back at five had a bathe and milked two cows Monday Up at six a m and bathed the foreleg of the mare with hot water also had to milk her as the colt was not allowed to go near her Then did some hoeing in the garden and had a bathe After breakfast and dinner did a lot of various little jobs Tuesday Up at six a m and milked the mare again Shifted some pea straw out of the barn After breakfast unloaded a waggon of hay and got very hot as we were in a hurry expecting another load which by the way never came In the afternoon we played a lawn tennis match with the B Club Herbert and I Life at the Far m 1 won both our doubles and singles I played the captain who said he had not been beaten for three years When I was running the horse rake the other day I had a slight shine or two with Lucy who was in the rake Once she reared up and nearly broke the shaft which brought the boss round to see what was up in pretty quick time Yesterday I got up at six as usual and after a piece of bread and butter was set to work at some weeding in the garden I usually go and fetch the cows It had been raining all the day before and during the night too The clothes I wore were large straw hat flannel shirt pair of blue serge trousers socks and top boots At eight o clock I came in to breakfast which consisted of ham tea bread and butter After breakfast I went out and picked raspberries growing on canes or bushes about Life at the Farm two feet six inches high This I did till twelve my back was then beginning to ache We then had dinner which lasted about half an hour I picked more raspberries till two p m Afterwards I helped Herbert put a team of colts into the carriage and we went off to play a tennis match at C The day I have just described was one which we should term decidedly easy as we generally have not to pick fruit except when there is a large supply wanted Another reason was that it had been raining off and on for the last week and thus delayed the haying which had just begun We found that hard work and no mistake Three days ago we had a picnic to the shores of the Georgian Bay We bathed and ate wild strawberries and enjoyed ourselves very much The roads here are awfully rough now and then they are varied by patches of corduroy roads which consist of trunks of trees This makes a good deal of bumping Hi aymg M July I have only time for a few words We have been getting in hay very fast On Wednesday there was a sudden and very severe rainstorm I only brought in a load of hay about three minutes before it was raining bucketfuls and then the wind got up suddenly and one of the men had to rush and shut the barn doors to prevent the roof being blown off On Friday and Saturday we were working at hay till half past eight To morrow Monday we begin the wheat harvest I expect we shall have a fairly busy time of it We had an upset driving a team of colts into C on Wednesday One of them shied at a log in the road and we were all quietly deposited in the ditch Nobody was hurt August We have just finished taking the hay in here and for the next month or two we shall be employed getting in the harvest that 2 i8 Before the Harvest means breakfast at six and work till eight or nine in the evening We began cutting the wheat yesterday with a new machine that cuts the wheat and binds it into sheaves All the hay season I have worked in the barns taking the hay from the waggons and putting it away which is hot and dusty work though I have got used to it by now I feed the calves every morning and evening with pails of milk and most exasperating they are As there are four calves and two pails three of them get to one pail and one to the other the consequence is that the three get their heads jammed in and then jump about Wq have several colts here I am learning to ride them bareback sometimes without a bridle and with only a rope round their necks I can manage to stick on now though not very comfortably I have only been chucked off once Three nights ago Before the Harvest l9 we had a tremendous thunderstorm I was wakened about twenty minutes to three by the bedclothes being lifted off me by the wind we sleep with both door and window open There was only just time to get up and shut the window when the rain came down in torrents The lightning was wonderfully bright and incessant Once I could read my watch for nearly five minutes consecutively 
 III Harvesting An Awkward Customer A Hot Corner How to Drive in the Dark Finishing the Grain Harvest August To day being Sunday we had breakfast at a quarter past ten though I have been up since seven as I had to look after the driving horses and wanted to have time for a bathe as well Dick has been out most of the morning and is now herding cattle He has to drive them to the pastures and then watch them to prevent their getting to the crops We have been very busy all this week cutting the wheat and barley and then stacking it up Yesterday Dick and W played a tennis match against O beating them very easily indeed We do not expect Harvesting 21 to have any spare time for the next month as we shall be bringing in the different crops There has just been a spell of cool weather but it is hot again now about 960 By this time I can manage to stick on to a horse bareback pretty tight This morning we took three horses to the creek to water and raced back We had only bridles on so it was rather exciting We are both well and so sunburnt that I don t think you would know us if you met us in our working dress a large straw hat a gray shirt an old pair of trousers and sometimes boots up to the knees the sleeves of the shirts generally rolled up to the elbows our arms hands and faces being just about the colour of the chess box which Aunt K gave us Tell B that he would be surprised to see the way they garden here the celery trench is a slight furrow made with the corner of a hoe 1 inches deep and the tomatoes are planted out in patches like cab 22 Harvesting bages I don t think the fruit here is much better than at home the gooseberries are not nearly so good they have however a very good kind of red currant called the cherry currant the berries are about as big round as a fourpenny bit perhaps a little larger M wants to know how we get on without ices I expect we eat a good many more than you do We never go into C without having nearly a dozen each Everyone you meet treats you to an ice or lemonade Dick sends S a letter on birch bark It is just the same as they make the canoes from the rough outside skin being peeled off with a knife August All last week we have been getting in the wheat We have worked from 6 30 till 12 and from 1 till 8 or 9 good long hours and heaps to do the whole time Yesterday I went to the boss s other farm about six miles off to give a hand there Over twenty acres Harvesting 23 of wheat passed through my hands or rather through my pitchfork I pitched ten loads of sheaves on to the waggons and then pitched four loads off all between 12 30 and 7 30 and then I was less tired than on any other evening this week We shall have got the whole of the wheat and barley in by Tuesday night You ask about tobacco and cigars here They are simply ghastly As for the fauna and flora they are nothing very great There are squirrels musk rats mice chipmunks a sort of half squirrel ground hogs a sort of prairie dog I suppose about three feet long minx polecat and very seldom a skunk garter snakes and one or two rattlesnakes are seen every year A few hummingbirds lots of canaries sparrows and robins a kind of red breasted thrush blackbirds a kind of small crow crows and lots of small birds of the lark and stone chat kind The flowers are rather poor the wild iris being the best 24 Harvesting August We have been harvesting in real earnest following a reaping machine and stacking up the sheaves into groups of ten each consists of two leaning against each other This I did the other day from 6 45 a m till 7 p m ten acres5l about I could not work fast as there was a high wind on At other times we have been unloading waggon loads of sheaves in a barn This is done with hay forks the sheaves have to be tossed sometimes ten feet above your head to somebody who catches them with a fork and then throws them to another fellow who shoves them away I have done most of the unloading here and find it requires good muscles as well as a certain knack Yesterday I pitched off loads of sheaves from 6 30 a m till 9 p m allowing intervals for meals the only parts of me at all stiff were my fingers This shows that I am getting pretty well hardened to the work I think the harvesting very jolly and Harvesting 25 I am seldom really tired now after a day of it This morning Sunday I went down with P B to herd cattle about half past eight We came back at ten minutes to eleven I was rather hungry as I had not had anything to eat since yesterday s tea at 4 30 We have very fine cucumbers here and plenty of them I ate one about thirteen inches long for break fast this morning The weather now is hot enough to roast a potato August We have at last got all the wheat in and on Friday we had our first threshing from six a m till six p m with one hour s stop for dinner at twelve Dick was in the wheat mow handing or rather forking out sheaves and I had charge of two colts in the straw mow and had to drive them round to tramp down the straw They had tremendously hard work and were so tired that they did not resist at all when we rolled them out of a hole at the top of the barn on to a heap of straw I thought they would never get lb An Awkward Customer down safe but they did somehow We got the straw packed in so tight that the sides of the barn bulged out considerably About 500 bushels of wheat were threshed out of fifty acres not very grand was it The boss has been keeping a thorough bred polled Angus cow for his brothers It is a great job milking it as it kicks like one o clock It has to have its hind legs roped together and then it jumps around pretty lively As it weighs over 1 500 pounds you may imagine what a business it is It has a calf and charges round in very lively style on every opportunity It will run half a mile to get at a dog The other day it nearly knocked a colt through the stable wall Horned cattle are the only things which it is afraid of never having had anything to do with them before I have told you that the housewives have come in very useful So would the looking glass T also on the railway journey if I had but had a pocket comb with me As it was I could An Awkward Customer 27 only see the state I was in without being able to remedy it About half of the harvesting is done now Oats and barley are being brought in Three days ago when it was raining we put all the wheat that had been threshed through a fanning mill to separate it from the chaff grass seeds etc I had to supply the mill and it kept me going pretty sharp The quantity of house flies is positively awful They are most irritating and injurious to the temper The heat is fearful I write this letter in my shirt sleeves gasping for breath at every word and the perspiration pouring down my face into my eyes and maddening me almost as much as the flies do The pigs of the establishment have been put in my charge At present there are ten but I expect many more Two are being prepared for exhibition and eight for fattening September We are still hard at work harvesting and shall continue to be till the 28 A Hot Corner end of this month On Thursday and Friday we were threshing barley and wheat The dust was something awful Not getting the wheat done in one day we started again the next and in the afternoon did o a full hour s work in thirty five minutes The machine men were rushing it My place was at the end of the straw carrier Dick was next I passed it to him at the rate of thirty forkfulls a minute and he kept pace but the man next him could not and a great pile rose up next Dick compelling him to fork higher and so I had to pass the straw higher too We built a stack twelve yards long by six yards broad and about twelve feet high in the thirty five minutes the whole passing through first my hands and then Dick s On Monday P B and I drove twenty miles to a place where we had business We walked the horses the whole way there as we had a cow tied on behind We started at eleven a m and How to Drive in the Dark 29 got there at half past eight with an hour s stop halfway After something to eat we started back again at ten p m this time without the cow But after we had gone a couple of miles we had to stop as it was so dark that we could not see over the horses ears I made my way to a neighbouring farmhouse which we could see by its light and fell into a ditch and ran into two fences before I got there I bought a lantern for fifty cents and returned I found we had driven right across the road and that the horses were standing in a large ditch about three feet deep So you see we only stopped just in time The only way we had of driving before we got the light was to go as straight as we could till we felt the side wheels of the buggy going down into the ditch and then to pull the horses a little the other way till we felt the other ditch We hung the lantern on the dash board of the carriage and started again By its light we could see about two yards ahead of the 30 Finishing the Grain Harvest horses We got home about eight next morning both very sleepy All yesterday I was following a self binding reaper setting up the sheaves As the thistles were plentiful my hand became rather like a pincushion full of pins On Wednesday I bought some common cotton shirts to work in when barley had to be couched as the beards stick into the flannel ones and make them feel like hair shirts The flannel our shirts were made of was too good and the perspiration made them shrink awfully at first they ought to have been of much coarser flannel September It would be very nice if you could send me a drawing of Neighbour s new hive From what you say it seems to be handy and would indeed suit this climate very well It is extraordinary how few people keep bees here though they would have splendid honey getting facilities as there are two crops of clover and heaps of wild raspberries and Finishing the Grain Harvest 31 bushes of that kind You will be glad to hear that we have nearly finished getting in the harvest Indeed after this week I do not think there will be any more working after six in the evening We shall have I think about three days and that will about end up everything except the root crops and they only take about a week to get in Now as to wearing something when barley threshing I find that it is not anything like so bad as represented The last time we threshed barley I had two hours in what is supposed to be the worst place and I found no inconvenience at all I took the place while the man who had it went to get a drink and then found it was not worth while to go back to my old station But anyhow I shall get some goggles They are better than veils which it would be impossible to wear one gets quite hot enough without them There is no danger of our over working ourselves as we generally manage to get into a place 32 Finishing tbe Grain Harvest where nobody can run us I have been only tired out once since I came here I had to do some very heavy pitching I pitched eight loads of wheat sheaves over a beam seven feet high and sixteen feet behind me and further had to keep pace with the man who pitched them off the waggon I managed to hurry the man who took the straw from me I did not feel the least tired about an hour afterwards when I had had a bathe Yesterday afternoon I was running a mowing machine rigged up so as to cut peas I rather liked it after stacking sheaves of barley and oats Perhaps you would like to know something of our regular expenses here Three dollars a month for washing some postage a missionary subscription and one or two other small things so you see we do not need much What we spend the money on is chiefly those things we were not able to bring out or did not know of I think it would be worth Finishing the Grain Harvest 33 while almost to send you the flannel shirts we have not used or get rid of them as it is ruin to them to use them and have them washed here We could get some more suitable ones in their place The Parcel Post is thirty five cents a pound for anything under five pounds 
 IV A Slight Relaxation The Indian Summer Getting in the Root Crops What ought to be Learnt before Coming to Canada September This week we began drawing in peas of which there are fifty acres I had to level it straw and all and tramp it down This was very warm and dusty work Sometimes I sank down into it three or four feet deep I rather liked it as there was some satisfaction in seeing a heap about eight feet high trampled down quite level for it is very soft The waggons were unloaded in four forkfuls the fork being worked by horse power and fastened on pulleys On Tuesday morning I herded cattle It was awfully hot so I drove them A Slight Relaxation 35 down close to the bush and getting into the shade went to sleep The cattle did the same so I had an easy time of it In the afternoon I helped to stow away sheaves of barley in the barn In the evening we all drove to a ball in C and had a jolly time We came back the same night arriving at half past two Next morning we got up at seven worked till breakfast at eight and then went to tramp peas and stow oats Before breakfast on Saturday I was half way home from the stream where I had been watering a colt when a train came running along the line which is about ten yards from the road the colt shied and threw me off on to my head I got a goodish cut on it but nothing more happened except that I was stunned for about a minute After dinner I fished in the stream At first I used grasshoppers for bait with shot or float I got a few small ones this way The biggest I got by using only a piece of pink string On Friday 3 2 36 a 4 Slight Relaxation night we went to another ball at C which was rather a big affair There were about forty people there The woods about here are now beginning to change The Virginian creeper has turned a deep red and looks splendid as it hangs down from the trees if October There was an exhibition in C a week ago A number of prizes were offered for exhibits of honey and wax Only one man exhibited and his exhibit seemed to us a very poor affair The i lb sections could not have weighed more than io oz each The exhibition was very good for a town the size of C There was a splendid show of fruit especially apples some of which weighed a pound apiece Mrs B showed fruit vegetables flowers and poultry getting in all seventeen prizes ten or eleven firsts Nothing from the farm was shown though they had intended to show two pigs but it would have m A Slight Relaxation 37 taken too much trouble We have been having some wet and cold weather lately and there was a heavy fall of snow on Friday but we hope to get three weeks of fine weather the Indian summer before the cold sets in There were three inches of snow on the ground at mid day it was considered unusually early as they seldom have a fall till the middle of this month and not often then The wild duck and geese are beginning to come though we have had no shooting to speak of yet we hope to get some soon Dick and I preserve skins of anything which we shoot The woods are looking splendid now Imagine Virginian creepers hanging down from trees some three or four hundred feet high On Wednesday we had a football match at C I played for them and we won by three goals to one I don t think that I ever looked forward to Sundays so much as I do now The only work which we have to do is to feed the pigs After 38 The Indian Summer breakfast to day I strolled down to the creek and caught a few fish Then came lunch After lunch a pleasing repose The rest of the family all went to Sunday school excepting the boss so he and I cooked the dinner Towards the end of this month Dick and I hope to go camping on the islands in the lake and get a little shooting There is not much game to be got round about here o o October The last three or four days have been splendid the Indian summer has regularly set in We have been busy carting in peas and oats it is rather late to do so but the rainy weather we have had threw us back very much We work now till 6 30 by that time it is nearly dark There will be a tremendous rush for the next fortnight getting in the root crops and finishing the harvest After this there cannot be much more to do except preparing for the winter This morning after feeding the pigs horses etc I went with The Indian Summer 39 P in the buggy to look for the sheep which had strayed away in the road We started at 8 15 and got back at 11 driving about fourteen miles over roads filled with mudholes often quite a foot deep and in places covered with boulders Last night I went with P driving round the country He was buying up cockerels to fatten for the winter he gave 20 or 25 cents about iod or is a pair for them Turkeys can be bought from 60 to 75 or 80 cents geese for 45 cents Still poultry are said to pay pretty well here The wild geese and duck are coming down from the North in large numbers now the flocks of geese sometimes numbering as many as a hundred We are trying to rush the harvest and shall get it done in three days if the weather holds fine There are huge quantities of fruit going now the grapes are ripe and there is such a quantity of apples that they are lying by hundreds on the ground 4o The Indian Summer where they rot for want of eating We do all we can to save waste but we can t manage more than twenty apples each in one day besides the grapes Out here it seems the more fruit you eat the better your health is at least we find it so Dances at C are coming on now I have been learning the Canadian dances and am getting quite clever at them October Snow has beenlying on the ground for the last three days Last night we had quite a hard frost and to day there have been snow hail and rain off and on On Thursday Dick went to S a town nine miles off helping a man to drive some cattle which he bought from the boss he walked back as he did not care to wait five hours for the next train When he got in the whole front of his waterproof was a sheet of ice from the sleet and hail however he did not get a bit wet as he had boots up to his knees and a Getting in the Root Crops 4i waterproof down to his ankles We have just finished getting in the apples and grapes we were only just in time to save them from the frost On Tuesday I went to a party in C we got there about 8 30 which was in good time considering that we only stopped work at half past six and had to dress have tea and drive five miles Dick could not go as he had a cold All tennis is over now we shall get no more warm weather We have taken to chess instead How does K s cow do Do you know that the usual cost of a first class cow here except of course thoroughbreds is 20 A good horse costs from 100 to 200 which is very little compared with what is given in England Of course they are not quite such good ones I milk the five cows every morning and evening now one of them kicks furiously Yesterday afternoon we had a great time putting up the stoves They have no regular fireplaces here but a stove in one 42 Getting in the Root Crops of the lower rooms a pipe runs up through the ceiling into a bedroom and then into the chimney and thus warms both rooms splendidly There is only one coal stove in the house and that is in the hall it is a self feeder the hopper only has to be filled morning and night and then it feeds the fire by itself Everyone here seems to feel the cold tremendously though it only seems just a little cool to Dick and myself They say that Englishmen never do feel it half so much the first few winters We are still working at the root crops grubbing up potatoes with our hands after the plough has been over the lines We also have to grub up mangolds and slice the tops off This work which we have kept up for two or three days running is somewhat hard on the back and hands To day we went to the B Farm four miles off and cleaned barley in a fanning mill When we drove home again the teamster went as hard as he could What Ought to be Learnt before Coming 43 over the corduroy bridges and the stones The jolting was something appalling and we had to hang on with our eyelids thanking our stars that it was not after tea I have gained lb in three weeks During the harvest time I weighed 153 lb now I weigh 158 lb just what I did when I left the old country We are told that during the winter we shall get very fat October You ask what knowledge will be of use to you if you join us out here There are plenty of things which you might learn with advantage carpentering and blacksmithing for instance but a little veterinary knowledge would be worth all the rest put together It is of the very greatest importance out here as everybody has something to do with cattle and hardly any have any veterinary knowledge I only wish we had been able to learn something of it before we came out As it is we shall have to read it up now as much as we 44 What Ought to be Learnt before Coming can Thatching and gardening are also good o o o o things to know something about Dick s fall was not the first and will not be the last I have been thrown off about fifteen or twentv times already indeed I am getting quite used to it now We shall have a lot of driving and riding this winter as there will be several horses to be exercised The life out here is pretty much what we expected perhaps rather more civilized The country has a most quaint appearance after England For instance in pretty nearly every field are large piles of wood stones etc and now and then the tall charred trunk of a tree quite bare of limbs and burnt into the most extraordinary shapes Another curious feature in the country is the roads if we may so call them You drive over them in a waggon without springs sitting on a board or anything that comes handy This as you may imagine is the very extreme of all that is annoying and painful Bringing in the root crops is perhaps What Ought to be Learnt before Coming 45 the most unpleasant work harvesting though hard enough is rather jolly We shall have some ploughing soon There is a nice piece of rough ground reserved specially for us and it looks very inviting as it has only lately been cleared We don t get much shooting as on a big farm like this there is generally something to do This time I m afraid we shall not be able to get any camping out since the weather has made us late with the root crops They will not be done till the end of this month The mangolds and potatoes are done but there still remain about 12 000 bushels of turnips to be brought in This morning we all drove down to church Dick and I in the buggy The others started ahead of us and when we tried to pass kept galloping across the road in front of us Tiny got so excited that I could not hold him and he ran away We passed them then sure enough but there was a corner just in front which we went round at full speed I made sure we 46 What Ought to be Learnt before Coming should have been upset as the outside wheels of the buggy were quite two feet from the ground and there is a steep hill the other side of the corner However I managed to stop him But when we got to the bridge we had O O more trouble Some people who had been celebrating Hallowe en had put a big red waggon on the railing on one side and a large sleigh on the other Of course Tiny would not pass these at first and when he did he had his front legs in the air most of the time We got down iust in time for church 
 V Winter Occupations and Amusements Christmas Sleighing A Little Real Cold Cow Driving The Sport here Plans for going North West A few more Hints to Would be Immigrants November The winter is really commencing now A day or two ago we had quite a hard frost the water jugs in two of the rooms were frozen and the cold kept on during the whole of the next day Last Saturday week a sudden snowstorm came on while we were pulling turnips It was so thick that you could not see a team of horses forty yards away As it was impossible to leave the turnips which we had been pulling to be frozen while lying on the ground we had to go on at it All hands 48 Winter Occupations and Amusements were started to load them on to the carts and waggons This was somewhat cold for the fingers Fortunately the storm only lasted half an hour Still it left an inch and a half of snow on the ground By the way if not too late the woollen gloves should be like babies gloves a big bag for the fingers and a small one for the thumb those with fingers are next door to useless I got your letter on Tuesday at dinner but had not time to read it as I had to go to a threshing We were having a great time threshing just then it lasted all Monday Tuesday and Wednesday We began at seven on Monday and threshed out one barn on that day As it is best not to wash the face in the middle of a threshing we did not wash for dinner and so looked as black as niggers The only clean place on the face was just round the mouth where we had to make a road for the provisions Washing the face makes the dust stick worse Winter Occupations and Amusements 49 On Wednesday we finished the second barn and started on another I was outside on the stack while it was raining snowing hailing and blowing At twelve I drove a man home who had hurt himself a bit As I went straight from the threshing and was wet through when I came back I had a thick coat of mud all over In the afternoon Dick was on the stack while I went on horseback to return a lot of sacks which had been lent to the boss When I got back the threshing was over As they had threshed a few peas the dust was very bad Dick when he came in had a quarter of an inch of solid mud all over his face and I had to scrape part of it off with his knife before he washed The mud consisted of chaff barley beards and dust He began with goggles on but they got caked over at once It freezes every night now and sometimes in the day The other day it started to freeze about 10 a m after quite a mild night Dick and I have 4 50 Winter Occupations and Amusements bought some felt overshoes which go over light shoes such as we brought out and are much warmer than boots they are also snow proof The soles and sides are of india rubber They will last at least two winters Everyone here wears them and you can go out to work with only a pair of slippers and these overshoes on in the coldest weather We don t have such early hours now as in the summer we seldom get up before 6 30 or 7 Our winter has not begun in earnest yet it is most unusually late The last thing that we have done is moving the large straw stacks formed during the threshing into barns This finished yesterday thank goodness and thus ends the regular work Cattle feeding has just begun that is we get up at 6 30 and give the cattle some food to last till we have had our breakfast Then they get turnips sliced up by a machine which we have to turn and pretty stiff work it is Afterwards they are watered the whole stable is cleaned Winter Occupations and Amusements c i out and the beasts are bedded down with clean straw This takes about an hour and a half and has to be done every morning and evening Sundays included Dick feeds the pigs fifteen of them and I look after the horses so we do not come in for the cattle work much You will be pleased to hear that Dick weighs 11 stone 9 and is increasing He was 10 stone 10 a month ago I am also in good condition but I should not like to say how much my weight is December Dick and I have been staying with B in Toronto for a few days When we left B there was a foot and a half of snow on the ground and we were quite prepared to spend the night in the train The first train took one hour to do the three miles between B and C It had two engines and only two cars However we were only an hour late taking six and a half hours to do 4 2 52 Christmas ninety miles We had had a snowstorm during the whole of the two days before we left and it was just clearing a little when we did leave On the day before we left we had a shooting match which was almost extinguished by the snow We had to stand inside a building and shoot at a mark outside There were only four turkeys competed for and I got two and Dick one we paid ten cents apiece for shots and we each had three shots We sold the turkeys to Mrs B for fifty cents apiece The long boots which we brought out here are splendid I spent two days walking about in snow sometimes three or four feet deep and my feet never got damp By loosening the laces too we can make them quite warm The corduroy trousers are also very warm I expect when you receive this letter you will be making preparations for the Christmas dinner such as stirring the plum pudding etc We were back at B in time to help in the big stir I was cutting up beef five or Christmas 53 six days ago and I cut a round weighing over thirty pounds to be spiced for Christmas Do you know I am getting quite an expert butcher now I can cut up a beef quicker than you could believe When we returned to B we found that our work had become much easier Sawing and splitting wood feeding horses and cattle and sleigh driving were our chief occupations As yet we have had no snow shoeing or skating But the sleighing o o o o is simply splendid you go along so smoothly with a light swinging motion and as it is cold you are able to let the horses go at full speed without their getting hot You asked in your last letter about white foxes Once or twice they have come down as far as here but very seldom There are minx however and plenty of partridges and rabbits Everything now is in a state of great preparation for Christmas Three great rounds of beef are being spiced in the cellar In the evening we go and help decorate the church As there is no holly 54 Sleighing here all the decorations are in swamp cedar a tree which looks something like an arbor vitas The sleighing is very good now though the snow is only four inches deep Lately we have been doing some teaming Dick O O has charge of one team and I of another We have great fun sometimes when there are a lot of boys round They run and try to get on to the back of the sleigh and then we either go so fast as to prevent them getting on or swing them off going round the corners The sleighs are built like this J Z7 g z The top of the sleigh is constructed so as to turn on the runners so that when you go sharply round a corner the back runners swing right round and run out to one side for a few moments It is almost impossible then to A Little Real Cold 55 hold on to it Here is a sketch of the position of a sleigh turning a corner December It was snowing hard all day here on Christmas Eve During the morning and the best part of the afternoon the snow was very soft and wetting We got nearly wet through the only things that did not let in the wet were the corduroys However about half past four it began to freeze ferociously and one s coat got as hard as a board and crackled when one moved one s arms about When I brought my team into the stable they were covered with snow and ice nearly an inch thick and I had to scrape it off with a large 56 A Little Real Cold knife used for topping turnips That night the six o clock train passed B at twelve having been snowed up at a place thirty miles south of us We did not have an extra great time on Christmas Day We went in to service at ii and got out at 2 15 then we had a small sort of lunch and did nothing more till 5 30 when there was a great feed We had no work to do that day as we had arranged with the man who does most of the feeding that we should give him a goose and he o o should do all the work he proposed it and we were very glad to accept his offer Thank you very much for the Graphic and Illustrated The pictures will very nearly finish covering the walls of our room which are half covered already We have got some really heavy snow here now and some pretty bad drifts Last evening about 5 30 T and I started in the cutter a single horse sleigh to hold two or three to fetch P from a place four miles from here We had nearly arrived there when A Little Real Cold SI we got off the beaten track it was snowing so hard that I had to let the horse take his own way and trust to his keeping on the track and in less than half a minute we went slap into a deep drift The horse and cutter stopped dead and when we got out the snow was just up to our arm pits and I could only see part of the horse s neck and his head As we had lightened the cutter by getting out the horse managed to pull it through the drift and we started again with our pockets and clothes stuffed fiuTof snow When we came back we managed to keep what little track there was but we had to walk the horse most of the way This morning six more inches of snow had fallen when we woke fortunately there was no wind but if it does blow at all the roads will be nearly impassable We are getting some pretty severe frosts now and F has already had occasion to have his nose rubbed with snow We are wearing jerseys over our shirts and under our 58 A Little Real Cold waistcoats and when it gets really cold we shall start vests and cardigans too We have had one or two small blizzards I wish we could let one loose by way of effect on our friends at home they would never want another dose They are truly awful things The snow freezes in great lumps on your eyebrows and chin and nose every now and then you have to use your hands to open your eyes which get frozen up It is quite impossible to keep the snow from getting down your neck Dick is getting horribly fat and lazy Every evening nearly when he sits down in the sitting room he goes to sleep and snores loudly The Misses B generally wake him up by dropping the cat on to his face or something of that kind January 1887 You are right in thinking it cold here on Thursday the thermometer was at 150 F all day I wore a cap in the morning but in the afternoon a hood showing only my A Little Real Cold 59 eyes and nose My breath condensed into a lump of ice half as big as my fist on the outside of the hood It was impossible to keep always at work about every ten minutes you had to stop and start jumping up and down and bang your arms round to get warm again Even the milk got frozen in carrying it from the stables to the house a distance of about 150 yards Ever since Thursday night we have had a terrific blizzard blowing The snow is now three feet on the level and runs up to ten or fifteen feet in the drifts Yesterday Dick F and I were in the pleasure sleigh We got into a drift and broke three out of four traces In the afternoon we started to go to C and took an hour and a half to go a little over a mile Then we got into a drift and stuck completely the snow being over the horses backs They were quite unable to move either themselves or the sleigh so we got out It looked most peculiar to see each one as he got out sink 6o A Little Real Cold right down to his arm pits and his great loose ulster spread out on the snow alongside WTe trampled the snow down by the horses then lifted the sleigh right round and went back When we arrived at home our faces were caked over with frozen snow leaving only a space for eyes and nose All to day they have been running single O O engines with snow ploughs on the railway track to keep it open No one thought the clergyman would be able to get here this O O morning from D five miles off but he did so arriving at about twelve He had taken over three hours and had to walk in front of his horse and sleigh most of the way Of course there was no congregation so he went back January We are not having nearly such cold weather now as before Generally there are only about 200 of frost during the day and 3 2 at night Whereas we have been having A Little Real Cold 61 6 or 8 below zero during the day and 190 or 200 below at night I will now proceed to gratify your heart by telling you what I am wearing On cold days 8 below zero I wear vest pants corduroys flannel shirt jersey waistcoat or cardigan and leather trimmed jacket high boots one pair of socks a pair of wool mitts a pair of buckskins and a cap This cap we only pull right over our faces during blizzards On comparatively warm days I wear the same minus the cardigan or waistcoat The work now consists in getting up at 6 30 or 7 grooming our respective teams of horses then breakfast at 7 30 the whole crowd of us together eleven in all After breakfast I feed the pigs then we harness our teams and draw chaff hay turnips or carrots from the barn or from pits in the fields as the case may be It is rather fun driving to the fields for in front of the gateway and all round it there is a large drift When the 62 A Little Real Cold horses see this they make for it as hard as they can plunging and jumping in fine style in the snow which is often up to their backs Sometimes they get in so deep that we have to drag their legs out or the sleigh or both standing up to our waists to do it After dinner we do the same till 5 20 then we take the horses to water feed pigs colts etc knock the snow and ice off their feet and come in about 6 30 and have tea It is gi eat fun to see the steam sn ow ploughs pass here on the railroad they come past at full speed and run full tilt into a drift which is often as high as the smoke stack After a short time amid a tremendous cloud of snow you see the plough appearing on the other side perfectly choked up with snow It has cut clean through the drift leaving a high wall on either side Sometimes they have to charge two or three times at a drift before they can cut through it The passenger trains are often several hours late Co w D riving 6 3 February A few days ago P and I drove to Mr L s to see a friend who has got work there Mr L is supposed to have the best stables north of Toronto They are certainly very nice and it is very easy to feed cattle and horses in them Here it takes one man the whole day to feed thirty head while there one man in an hour and a half can do all that is necessary in the morning and the same at night Our friend seemed to like his quarters very much He gets 5 a month and his board and in the summer he is to get 10 The other day I had a great time driving a cow down here from North L I think that I mentioned in a letter about the end of September that P and I took a cow there Well I had to fetch it back I started at 7 a m and walked six miles to the railway track I caught the train at S which brought me to North L about 9 30 I then went and got the cow at once and started to lead it back home a dis 64 Cow Driving tance of some twenty miles As it had been kept in the stable and fed very well since September it was exceedingly lively and indeed during the first five hundred yards rolled me over three times in the snow After that however it cooled down and walked along quietly for the first four miles Then it got tired and I had to pull it along by the halter it was terribly slow as the snow prevented us from going more than two miles an hour I got very hungry before we O J O got to S the first place where we could stop This we reached at about 2 30 After three quarters of an hour for food and rest both for myself and the cow and its calf for it had a calf we started on again The cow was still tired and the calf rather footsore so it was a slow business About half way there the cow stopped dead and refused to move an inch I was just wondering what on earth I should do when a man came along with three calves which he had brought from S O H The Sport Here S starting an hour after I did With his help I managed to get them the rest of the way though it was anything but easy work The cow was a very valuable animal a thoroughbred polled Angus worth 200 Three days ago we had another blizzard which left us another foot of snow To day the thermometer stands at io below zero but there is no wind and the sun is very hot and the sky as blue as in summer Last night we went to a political meeting N The two candidates had both called a meeting at the same place and at the same time Of course there was a row They both set to work to abuse each other At last the Liberal had to go as things were getting a little too hot for him In your last letter you asked more particularly about the sport here We might have got some very decent deer hunting if we had had time Two or three fellows from the neighbourhood made a camping out expedition to the mouth of the Nottawasage River j 5 66 The Sport Here not very far from here They had a great time and shot several deer Quite a number of wild duck and a few gangs of geese came in October and November but as they were very wild and everybody was out after them it was not easy to get a shot The fish to be obtained in the Georgian Bay are black bass which are caught with a spoon and give plenty of play white fish the same as pike to judge by appearance and caught in the same way There are also plenty of lake trout Occasionally people use flies for these but most of the fish I m sorry to say are taken with nets In the mill streams and rivers there are plenty of chub For these I usually bait with a grass J O hopper And now I wish to tell you something of our plans for going North West in the spring When in Toronto we asked the advice both of Colonel D and the G They both said it was the best thing we could do Flans for going North West 67 Calgary in Alberta is where we specially thought of going It is just east of the Rockies and the climate is very much milder than here We thought of spending two years there and then if it still seemed advisable of going on to British Columbia We could then decide which of the three we liked best before settling down for good British Columbia the North West or Ontario This we must do at once as all free land grants are to cease in 1890 though probably the time will be extended As to getting there we shall try and get a passage with some cattle Men taking cattle up there employ several men to look after them and give them free passes over the railway If we cannot manage this we shall of course have to pay our fare which will be 50 by immigrant car We should have to have about 25 in our pockets when we got there Altogether we should want about 125 twenty five pounds Once there we shall board ourselves if we can That 5 2 68 Plans for going North West will be cheaper than boarding out at 12 a month Of course the man with whom we get work may give us board and lodging as well as wages But if we board ourselves we can do something in the way of keeping bees poultry and a cow I dare say the cooking would not be good at first but practice will improve that It would require some outlay to start this about 10 but we should more than get this back in six months time We feel that the sooner we learn to do for ourselves the better it will be We can get a shanty for 1 50 cents per month T seems to be learning quite the right kind of things in England Horse shoeing OO O he will find most useful I only wish we had had time to learn it in fact we have thought of putting in a few months with a blacksmith ourselves He ought also to learn welding 0 o iron and steel brazing and tempering such things as the tines of a fork Carpentering too is very useful what we learnt from More Hints to Would be Immigrants 69 Everson as the putting up a cow shed was invaluable He should be able to cobble a little and mend his own clothes Bookkeeping is quite indispensable if you mean to run a farm Gardening is also a good thing to know Our outfit was just about complete Some coarse cotton shirts as they keep out the thistles and the barley beards would have been an advantage flannel shirts make you like a pincushion directly A big fur cap round and large enough to cover the ears would also have been an advantage Flannel shirts should be of very coarse material good flannel is useless Some light strong breeches as well as corduroys are useful for the summer It is well not to have many cloth clothes and a light mackintosh is better than a heavy waterproof The india rubber baths which we did not bring would have been very useful 1 
 VI Lumbering Signs of Spring Cattle Driving Again Storing Ice Reasons for Thinking it Best to Move North West How to Start in a Small Way r Return of Spring Freeing the Mill Dam Skunk February A short time ago we had a blizzard which lasted for four days It did not blow very cold but the snow drifted tremendously One day the mail train which was due at 12 20 passed at 3 a m the next morning Next day Mr B and I went up the mountain The roads were in grand condi tion the snow being drifted eight or nine feet deep in some places Coming down one steep slope the horses slipped or rather sat down and we all had a sort of toboggan slide for about a hundred and fifty yards Fortunately Lumbering 7i the snow was deep enough to prevent our getting up any very great speed Twice I had to jump out and hold up the cutter to prevent its upsetting Soon we expect to go up there to haul lumber to the saw mill Lately we have been drawing firewood from the bush It is first sawn into lengths of four feet and then split and piled on the sleigh crossways It is terrifically hard work for the horses as the loaded sleighs have to be drawn over trunks of trees and through the under bush There were also numbers of holes made by the tearing up of trees in the high wind We turned one load clean over and had to put it on again With the other load we did very well till we reached a big hole and then chuck went the front bob of the sleigh into the hole and weight and jerk together broke the centre of one of the side beams The wood was piled on again and then in trying to draw out of the hole the horses drew clean away from the sleigh and 1 Lumbering bent the draw bolt which is quite an inch thick We had to chain them to the sleigh after that as we had no means of straightening the bolt But after a bit we got away all 0 O J right though the horse s legs were awfully cut about by their sharp shoes when they plunged into the deep snow March The day before yesterday one of the yearling colts got upset into a manger in the stable and not being discovered it remained there for some hours on its back the whole time When we found it it was necessary to chop the manger down with an axe to get it out and then it was utterly unable to move We spent about two hours rubbing its back and legs then we rolled it into a flat kind of sleigh called a stone boat and brought it down to a warmer stable We gave it gruel and linseed tea several times during the even ing and it seemed so much better at ten o clock that we thought there was no need to mm Signs of Spring 73 sit with it but yesterday its head was awfully swollen and it could not eat In the evening we had to kill the poor beast as inflammation ofthe bowels set in That seldom lasts more than half an hour so it was better to put it out of its pain To day the Chinook is blowing and we were able to dress with our window wide open Only three days ago the thermometer was down to 20 below zero Dick and I have started to teach ourselves book keeping as it would be little use to try to run a farm if we could not keep our books properly We found it pretty stiff at first but now we get on swimmingly We spend about an hour and a half at it every evening March This morning Dick and I had half an hour s skating but the ice was very poor It is the first we have had this winter Sleighing is nearly gone now as the roads in some Cattle Driving Again places are quite bare Yesterday I drove a load of lumber to C We made a road for the occasion through fields covered with ice and over ploughed fields as well which were often bar It is ticklish work to avoid the stumps and stones when driving over bare places Two days ago I started to walk up the mountain to meet some cattle about seven miles from here If they did not come I was to go on and bring them back next day They turned up all right and then came the business of driving them home They were completely tired out as they had already come some eight miles added to this the roads were in a frightful state two feet of soft snow in most places and where that had gone a foot of mud I had a very lively time The cattle tried to take every new road that we came to and made a rush for every gate However by dint of a long stick and incessant yelling I got them into a very obedient Storing Ice 75 state The boss has j ust sacked the man who did all the cattle feeding and milking or rather the man has just sacked the boss so the milking has again devolved on me To morrow we begin drawing ice from the o o lake It is cut into blocks about two feet cube and then about a ton and a half is put on to a sleigh We pack it all in an ice house fill up the cracks with small slips and then pour water to freeze it all solid after this we cover with eighteen inches of sawdust The ice will keep about fourteen months perhaps more Dick and I are proceeding like a house on fire with the book keeping We can now do simple keeping and can balance and close the ledger Do you know I have quite a reputation here as a doctor Twice I have been asked to look at children as you are something of a doctor One had the measles and the other inflammation of the lungs You would be astonished at the sudden 76 Reasons for Moving North West changes of temperature which we have here The climate is very changeable much more so than in the North West so far as I can learn Here are some temperatures taken at 7 a m February 21st 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 27th 28th 8 Mai 20 8 28 o 230 20 o 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 12 34 16 6 18 2 2 34 200 March I was sorry to hear the unsatisfactory news which you gave of the X s I should have thought they would have succeeded if anyone would But it is very hard to make grain farming pay unless you have a very good capital to start with and besides this they have had very bad corn seasons lately in Manitoba Now about going North West First I must try and disabuse you of the notion that Reasons for Moving North West the work there is harder than it is here In this place the work begins at 6 a m sometimes at 4 30 on a small farm it begins regularly at 5 In both cases it continues till 8 or 9 at night As all the time you are working in conjunction with other men you have to work your best for if you fall behind it becomes twice as hard at once In the North West work on a cattle farm would begin about 5 and would not last so long except on extraordinary occasions perhaps once or twice a month we should require to be in the saddle all night as well as all day But the work would not require nearly so much strength as it would be chiefly herding cattle After the first trouble of getting used to spending so much time in the saddle it would not fall so heavily on us Of work in the North West I only speak from what I have heard of the work here I have had experience Still if we found cow boy life too hard we would try to get work on other 78 How to Start in a Small Way farms this would not be hard I understand As to living it would be much the same as it is here Of course we should hav to camp out a good deal at night but that would be a blessing and not a hardship If we go on to a ranche in the North West we could in a year or two save enough to start with as the wages there are high When we have done this we should take up a little land two to three hundred acres and keep bees poultry and a few cows also we could grow fruit In addition to this we should keep a team and for the first year or two one of us might hire J o out with the team by the day whenever we had no work of our own for it He would earn 2 or 3 a day and so would help the farm considerably This would require very little capital to start and is one of the most paying branches of farming The two of us could take up three hundred acres of land and by complying with the requirements of the Land Office by cultivating a part of How to Start in a Small Way 79 it could in three years time get complete possession of it Then if we found we wanted capital we could sell part of it say fifty acres which if you had worked pretty well and had land well situated would fetch from 500 to 1 000 You see therefore that time is a consideration to us Everybody we meet advises us to go We shall earn good 0 O wages there as by that time we shall be competent book keepers Here the wages are miserably poor People pay labourers as little as they can and get as much as possible out of them for that little Though the boss has said several times that it is best to stay here he actually thought seriously at one time of giving up the farm here and going North West himself We shall get on well with riding there and after we have acquired some experience there of cattle there will be no difficulty in getting passes to British Columbia if we should wish to try that Another good reason for 8o How to Start in a Small Way going is the climate Here as the residents o o g themselves confess it is detestably changeable By the way we have both taken to wearing cholera belts so that the weather however suddenly it changes cannot affect our insides We are going to speak to the boss to night about getting off in the beginning of May and as to the chance of getting cattle passes As we shall be unable to let you know what way we go in time for your answer to reach us you had better send the 30 at once If everything goes as we hope we shall not have need for anything like this sum still it is best to be on the safe side and you may be sure that the money will not be spent unnecessarily The short time which we have put in in this country has taught us to be economical A cheque will I think be the best way though perhaps a draft is safer What you said about woollen underclothing is certainly right Even on the hottest summer days when from the nature of our work we Return of Spring 81 have to wear cotton shirts a thin vest is always advisable You asked some questions about the way of living here For breakfast we have meat and bread and butter ad lib The meat during the winter is beef either fresh or salted At dinner meat potatoes sometimes cabbages or beans and turnips also puddings of different kinds Occasionally soup takes the place of pudding For tea there is meat again fruit and bread and butter There is very little hardship about the living April The winter has really broken uj here I think and the snow is disappearing fast The days now are splendidly warm as the sun is very strong but the nights till last night have still been pretty cold about 22 F of frost All the roads are about six inches deep in mud and water Lambs are quite plentiful now and the birds are beginning to come back in fact we can both feel 82 Return of Spring and hear the spring returning We have been breaking in two three year old colts lately one has been in harness four times and has run away twice The other day I rather astonished him I wanted to take him down to the driving horses stable so I caught and bridled him I had quite a job to do it Then when he stood still for a minute I jumped on his back He had never experienced anything of the sort before and did not know what on earth to do For about half a minute he stood stock still and then started to go backwards chiefly on his hind legs After doing this for a short time I got him to go forward in a sort of fashion but it was mostly sideways At last one of the men came up behind with a long stick and gave him a couple of whacks and off he went in fine style Now he goes quite easily though it is not safe to make him canter or go beyond a slow trot as he would probably try some tricks and we don t want him to get S Return of Spring 83 into that way I do not get on him now as I m a bit too heavy for him The other colt has only been in harness once he has a pretty bad temper and it would take very little to make him kick furiously also he is as obstinate as a mule All this week Dick and I have been cleaning wheat to send to the flour mill at C It is very slow sort of work one turns the crank of the fanning mill while the other keeps the hopper full when we get about fifty bushels cleaned we bag it up and start on another lot Fifty bushels or twenty five bags make one load for a sleigh and a pretty heavy load too when the roads are bad Drawing out manure from the stable yards has commenced now and we have done a good deal of it still it is not half bad sort of work after all though of course there are other things which are preferable Mrs B has recommended that we should get some mittens made here of factory 6 2 84 Freeing the Mill Dam yarn which costs about sixty cents a pound and have them faced with skeepskin she said she would get some of the people round here to knit them for some of our old clothes a good plan I think The ordinary Berlin wool mittens cannot stand the rough wear though they are very good and warm to wear when not at work A pound of wool would make four pair The snow has not quite disappeared yet yesterday at noon the temperature was 68 F in the shade and at night it did not go below 5 2 This very moment it is 7 2 in the shade The thaw has been tremendously rapid and on Friday which is usually kept as a Sunday here we were working all the afternoon stopping ice at the water gate of the dam in order to let the water get away The ice had broken into blocks weighing about half a ton These kept striking against the planks so that we could not take them off we had to stand on the blocks which S Freeing the Mill Dam 85 were swaying and heaving in a fairly lively way and chop the corners off so as to let the water carry them over the edge of the planks The really lively part was getting off after you had set them free and before they went over Here is a little sketch of the dam c c c u 3 Ii 1 A A A solid immovable woodwork height 12 to 14 feet B movable planks for letting the water go over faster or slower by taking them off or putting them on c c c upright studs against which the planks were held by the force of the water The ice jammed against the top of B so that the planks could 86 Freeing the Mill Dam not be taken off Blocks too large to go between c c c had to be stopped Last night the ice jammed again and the water rose so high in consequence that it flowed over the top of the dam in several places further along The dam itself was only saved by the centre stud c giving way when of course all the middle planks went with it The height from the top of the planks is about 18 to 20 feet and the water falls on to a platform of large logs We are going to send you two or three skins The mink skin is almost large enough to make a muff You must be careful of it as it is worth something I have been offered 3 50 14 shillings for it already I shot it by the dam four or five days ago This morning we saw the first chipmunk we have seen since the winter began It is one that last summer used to sit on the edge of a roof just outside our window and this morning it appeared in its old place and chattered gait Skunk 87 away in a manner peculiar to the species It evidently took a great interest in the dressing process for it watched us intently the whole time Just as I was finishing this letter we had an alarm of skunk A fearful odour suddenly began to come in at the open windows and a cry of Skunk arose at once Dick rushed upstairs and came down with a loaded gun but we could not find the animal for it had made off but even out of doors it was not hard to tell that there had been one PART II EXPLORING BRITISH COLUMBIA L 
 VII A Change of Plans Our Journey to Victoria A Rough Voyage Our Destination at Last In their last letters the lads proposed the plan of going North West and gave some idea of the way in which they intended to work A few days after this an offer was made to them by an uncle in British Columbia Mr Z and his wife who had gone there with a view to settling were at that time engaged in looking out for a suitable locality His proposal was to this effect that the lads should come and join him in exploring the island of Texada If as he was inclined to think this island should prove a desirable place he further proposed that they should join him in running a farm of the same description as the 92 Our Journey to Victoria one they thought of starting near Calgary The offer was accepted and at the end of April they started to join their uncle at Victoria The next letter which was written from Victoria describes their journey to that place May As I have not much time I will describe our journey to this place by giving an extract from my diary I am afraid it is not very full but it is all I had time for Tuesday April 26th Rose at 7 a m had breakfast and finished packing After dinner we carried our baggage to the station came back and said good bye to the B s and then caught the train at 3 35 to B We arrived here about 6 p m and went to the house of a fellow we knew At 12 p m we caught the train for North Bay which landed us there at 8 next morning We slept all twm Our Journey to Victoria 93 night on seats without any cushions which were slightly uncomfortable Wednesday The train which was to meet us was seven hours late owing to having a very heavy load of cars so we went off to the Pacific Hotel and had a very good breakfast for 20 cents each I don t think they got much change out of us Then we strolled about the place and inspected the engine works which are very extensive After some dinner we stayed in the reading room till 3 30 and then went down to the station We got on a car which was going with our train but it was an hour before the train itself came in When it did come it shunted about till 6 30 At last we made a start for the West At first there was some very rocky country and we passed through two small tunnels the first I have seen in Canada When we came to the first of these there was an awful uproar among the colonials probably they had 94 Our Journey to Victoria never seen such a thing before During the night we managed to get to sleep but woke up at odd times thinking it was breakfast time Three times at ii i and 3 did I wake up with this hope only to find that it was a horrid delusion Thursday We woke finally at 4 o clock and spent the time till breakfast in looking out of the window The country now abounds with small lakes not less than one every mile of the track They were absolutely covered with wild fowl After breakfast alternately dozed and looked at the scenery which has become very rugged In the evening we arrived at Port Arthur There was just time to buy a loaf of bread when we started again Friday At 7 next morning we arrived at Rat Portage We got out here and were driven in a large dray at full gallop to the Queen s Hotel Here we had breakfast The country has now become rather flatter and is Our Journey to Victoria 95 more or less heavily wooded Near Winnipeg itself it is almost absolutely level and void of trees At last we found ourselves upon the Boundless Prairies At 2 o clock we reached Winnipeg Here we found an immense crowd at the station We got out and rushed about to find the train for the West We were only just in time to get seats though the train did not start for another hour or more It was awfully crowded and for the first few stations many had to stand The country was if possible more level than before studded every now andi then with farmhouses One of these about thirty miles from Winnipeg was on fire Saturday We reached Brandon about 7 in the evening Here the thermometer stood at 70 in the shade The prairie here is rolling and hilly there are plenty of streams and pools which are covered with wild fowl Brandon is a very nice place and is supposed Our Journey to Victoria to be the most prosperous town in Manitoba The prairies which have been a brown colour till now have begun to get greener There has been a scarcity of rain in these parts for a year or two All the prairie about here is strewed with buffalo bones many carloads of which are shipped to the sugar refineries During the morning we saw some deer and later a caravan of waggons going over the plain The plain is lined with old buffalo trails leading to the deepest pools which have water in summer There is still a little snow to be seen among the recesses of the hills Our travelling is at an average rate of thirty miles an hour In the train dining car you can get a pretty good dinner for 75 cents soup salmon lamb four kinds of vegetables including green peas apple tart and dessert The country through which we have passed during the latter part of to day is covered with about an inch of snow the reason is Our Journey to Victoria 97 that we have run into a snowstorm As we approached Medicine Hat the country became a good deal more varied and interesting in parts it was quite hilly At Medicine Hat some Indians came and tried to sell polished buffalo horns Whether they were real or not I can t say probably there were some of both After this the country again became absolutely flat and desolate apparently no settlements at all Once we had to stop some time to allow a herd of cattle to get off the track About midnight we reached Calgary Naturally we could not see much of it Directly we stopped crowds of people swarmed on to the cars to see who was there I got on to the platform for a moment and immediately a crowd of people poked their faces close to mine and inspected me so I got back again We started again in about twenty minutes Sunday This morning we found ourselves 7 Our Journey to Victoria entering the Rockies As we go on the scenery becomes splendid On each side of us are great peaks covered with snow and with great masses of pine trees Everywhere the snow is about three inches deep and the weather is rather cold The railway lies between two great ranges of hills thickly covered with pine forests The sun is just now rising and the snow topped mountain peaks standing out against the deep blue background of the sky look splendid as the light is thrown upon them Occasionally we pass houses which are inhabited by men who have to look after the track We breakfasted at Field About 1 30 after another halt we passed over a wooden bridge two hundred feet high We stopped once because of landslips which had to be shovelled out of the track the melting snow on the mountains makes the land very unstable When we went uphill we had an engine behind to help shove We passed two or three more bridges about two Our Journey to Victoria 99 hundred and fifty feet high and then the highest on the C P R three hundred feet high It seemed awfully steep when we looked out of window as there is no railing at the side The line is now running along the edge of the cliff on one side there is the sheer rock and on the other a ravine about half a mile deep and two miles broad There is a river winding along the bottom of it and the banks are covered with pines The mountains here are about 10 000 feet above the sea level and 4 000 above the level of the plain We have just now been passing under huge sheds made to prevent the slidings of mountain snow carrying away the track These sheds cover in the track altogether The line here takes a most circuitous wind along by the foot of some tremendous peaks About every five hundred yards we cross a bridge over some awful precipice Monday We woke at 5 a m and still found ourselves among the mountains but 7 2 Our Journey to Victoria they are not quite so high Now and then there are some clear spots and occasional Chinese settlements We reached New Westminster at 2 30 and caught the Victoria steamer I was fortunately not ill We reached Victoria at 9 30 The place swarms with Chinese with enormous pig tails I can t write any more now To morrow we start early for Texada being a party of five Aunt K and Uncle W Herbert myself and a Greek sailor Texada Island May We started from Victoria on Friday 6th and made about forty miles getting mto a small bay Maple Bay at 10 30 p m Next morning the wind was strong and squally and we did not start till late It was an awful job the getting out of the bay for we had to tack right across it several times and when we did get into the open a big A Rough Voyage 101 squall came and we had to let the mainsail fly and then haul it down The jib blew out of the bolt ropes directly after and we rushed up the coast at the rate often miles an hour under bare poles alone We got into Horse Shoe Bay Chemainus at 3 wet through though we got warm at the last the Greek Dick and myself taking the rowing boat and towing the sloop down the bay to the wharf We found an inn where we dried our clothes and had tea sleeping there on Sunday night as well On Monday we camped for the night on the north end of Thetis Island We lit a fire and had coffee and biscuits butter hot potatoes and fish We cut some poles and rigged up a big tarpaulin as a tent and then put the boughs off the fir poles on the ground and spread the bedding on them and the four of us slept on the top the Greek always sleeps in the boat In the morning after breakfast we started 102 A Rough Voyage again The tides run very strong on this coast and when we reached a place called Dod s Narrows which is about seventy yards across the tide running through at about ten knots and the wind falling we could not steer the boat one bit W had one of the long oars out and pulled a bit on one side to keep us off the rocks and went on pulling a few seconds too long and we got caught in the whirlpool on the further side below the rapids and were flung round twice quite helpless and he not taking his oar out of the water quick enough got a dig in the ribs from the end of it I got hold of the other oar and when we got clear of the whirlpool we pulled away as hard as we could However we could get no wind and about a mile from the rapids we stopped to get some lunch Before long we found that a back current was taking us back to the rapids at about three knots an hour so we started to pull again The wind came for a short time and took us A Rough Voyage 103 on our way a bit then it stopped and we had to tow into Nanaimo where we had tea beds and breakfast All this time we have been going north along the east coast f Vancouver Island in among all the little islands We started from Nanaimo in the morning with a good wind and crossed to the mainland ten miles and coasted up to Normanby Island where we camped sleeping on the boat for fear of wolves Next morning we started again up the channel between Texada Island and the mainland but having no wind only did ten miles and then towed into an inlet on the mainland where we camped The same thing happened next day and after making ten miles we towed into a bay at the north east part of Texada Island Starting again next morning the wind failed us and we towed into this harbour our destination W and K sleep in a tent and Dick and I in an old log hut with no doors 104 Our Destination or windows and only one third of the floor down Here the cooking is done with a stove and it serves as general living room W and K have been making gigantic efforts to bake bread and till the last time made it rather like lead The cooking is a terrible job to them every meal and it sounds very amusing to hear them blame everything but the cook the wood the stove those who cut the wood those who light the fire all get a share of the credit for heavy bread etc We have not done much exploring yet but at present the island seems to me all rocks and stones and one or two swamp meadows W however seems much taken with it I went over to Comox Vancouver Island two days ago the land there is first rate but most of it is taken up Harwood Island too as far as we could see would be a very nice place We may find good land on this island when we have explored it a bit more Last Our Destination 105 night the cove here was swarming with dogfish and they made a tremendous noise rushing about I was lying on a log at the edge of the rocks and pulled four out by their tails in about six minutes We had a bathe but the water was cold There are a few big trees on this island we saw some yesterday which would have squared to four feet one hundred feet from the ground and were seven or eight in diameter at the base 
 VIII The Island We go Exploring Chase After an Eagle A Savoury Dish Jubilee Day June At last we are seeing something of the backwoods as we have come to an island the population of which without ourselves consists of exactly four The country is extremely mountainous with occasional swamps of a few acres in extent and it is in the hope of finding a good sized piece of this that we are staying here At present we have only come across several small pieces and two or three small lakes which might be drained There are very good markets for produce not far off which would make dairying and fruitgrowing poultry keeping etc prosperous The Island 107 work In the harbour there are heaps of fish and in the autumn there must be good hunt ing as the place is alive with deer There are also plenty of eagles I know of eight nests within a mile radius ravens crows water fowl and any number of hummingbirds Herbert and I sleep together in the old log hut Our bed consists of a big tarpaulin on the boards then two grass mats then a buffalo skin fur upwards lastly ourselves and three blankets our coats being the pillows We get up at 5 30 light a fire get breakfast ready and eat it then go for an exploration getting back at 1 after lunch we explore again and get supper ready about 5 30 after supper we read or go for a walk bed about 9 30 or 10 I am afraid my writing is not very good but I cannot do any better as I am leaning on one elbow and writing with the same arm we have no chairs or tables By the bye v io8 We go Exploring if you wish to improve your writing you must do it soon for you are not likely to do it out here The weather now is beautiful hardly any rain as that nearly all comes in the autumn or winter The last two or three days we have been exploring pretty hard Yesterday we went to a lake taking our fishing tackle and on reaching it I started to fish while Herbert and W went round the lake After a quarter of an hour I had a bite and landed a lake trout weighing half a pound I was using paste then Afterwards I tried artificial flies and though the fish rose splendidly I did not catch any not being an adept in the art These lake trout are very game fish and are splendid eating having beautiful pink flesh To day we went on another exploration taking our lunch with us After walking for two hours we arrived at a lake and went round it lunching on the further side I We go Exploring 109 fished during the time having cut a splendid rod with my axe and using this time cheese paste there being too many trees for flies I used the cork of a bottle for a float and soon had a fine bite After playing a bit as much as I was able without a winch I landed a beautiful trout weighing three quarters of a pound We did not stay much longer so this was the only one I caught These lakes have small greenish mud turtles in them and a good many duck to day we saw two or three broods in the reeds After lunch we pushed on hard going up some awful hills of pure rock covered with thick moss After climbing nearly straight up for about four hours more we reached about the middle of the island where we could see the sea on both sides of us We then turned back taking a direct course to home as near as we could with the help of a compass which we have to use always on exploration here We went fairly straight striking our harbour about a We go Exploring mile and a quarter from the camp which we reached about 6 20 feeling that we had had enough for one day When walking here we generally take a straight line by the compass both going and coming We can never go more than two miles an hour as the country is very rough Sometimes we come to a mass of fallen trees which have to be clambered over sometimes to a deep ravine with a thick growth of young fir trees which we have to push our way through the ground all the time being rough and stony full of holes and covered with rotten and fallen trees Occasionally we chance on a green swamp with from three to twelve inches of water in it though many of them are nearly dry These we go straight across taking advantage of trees lying upon them Sometimes in the bush we find gigantic trees blown down and lying in our direction then we have a fair path for from 200 to 300 feet but rather slippery and ending in small We go Exploring chasms from ten to thirty feet in depth We have our boots nailed in order to be able to walk on these trees without slipping as sometimes they have no bark and on others it is wet or very loose We have bathed two or three times but the beach is not nice as it has quantities of barnacles on the stones which make it decidedly unpleasant There was a good deal of rain yesterday though it soon cleared up again we hardly felt it under the trees June A few days ago we went round the harbour and just outside it in the small boats picking up drift wood for seats tables etc for the camp We got a boat load and arriving home at half past one had lunch and started to make benches We sleep in a hut now above the main camp about sixty or seventy feet higher up To get to this we have to go up a very steep and winding pathway I have seen nobody except our own Chase After an Eagle party not counting Indians for nearly a month Yesterday Herbert and I went out shooting in the open boat along the shore landing every now and then as we were only rowing about ten yards from land and stalking anything worth shooting After rowing about twenty minutes we spotted an eagle on a tree about a hundred yards in shore so I landed Herbert with the rifle to stalk him while I kept the gun in case he came my way After about five minutes of anxious suspense I heard first one then another rifle shot and then a tremendous crashing and saw Herbert coming towards me as hard as he could carrying a great dead eagle a splendid bird with a white head and tail huge claws and a beak that would make you pale to look at It turned out that his first shot was successful in killing the bird his second wounded the mate which managed to escape We then continued our journey and saw what we Chase after an Eagle 113 thought was the wounded eagle settle a little further on I landed with my rifle and made my way towards him but he flew away and settled somewhere ahead so we followed him up and I landed again and saw him perched about seventy feet up on a bare tree about sixty yards from the shore I saw that I could not get up the cliff to the foot of the tree so I fired at him from the beach and saw him drop as I thought I scrambled up the cliff and after ten minutes search found a feather covered with blood but that was all At that moment I heard Herbert shout and found that the eagle had contrived to drop into the sea mortally wounded He rowed after it and managed to secure it after some trouble as it was most ferocious and lay on its back in the water with just its head and claws appearing He attacked it with an oar which it promptly laid hold of with all its might and was thus hauled into the boat When I got in it made a savage onslaught on 8 Chase after an Eagle my legs but the corduroys were a good armour against its claws It turned out to be the one Herbert had wounded My shot had gone through its leg and into its stomach thus nearly finishing it off We had some difficulty in killing it as it was still very lively This island positively swarms with eagles ravens and crows At the place where the stream runs into the harbour we found cartloads of dead herrings most likely in consequence of a very high tide lately when they had been driven up the stream as far as the tide went and when that dropped had not dared to go out being left dry or killed by the freshwater The harbour here is always full of herrings sprats etc and there is a great commotion when dog fish come in hundreds leaping out of the water at a time and tremendous scrambles ensuing at the surface Every night before we go to bed we have a systematic slaughter of mosquitoes A Savoury Dish IJ5 but they are not nearly so bad here as in Ontario I have to use the greatest precision as regards my bed for if I alter my position an inch I am nearly transfixed by a projecting edge of rock If I can avoid this I am very comfortable as I get into a groove lined with moss Herbert and I have already made a kind of clothes horse and an easy chair to hold two out of the drift wood June Last Monday we went for an exploration up to the north end of the island passing by a spot where a forest fire had raged It was positively awful walking all the fallen trees being out of sight and covered with a thick undergrowth We reached the sea on the other side and stopping to rest for ten minutes started home again About a mile and a half from home we saw a coon scuttling up a tree so we went for it and when we reached the foot of the tree W went up after it 8 2 n6 A Savoury Dish When near the top he began cutting it off half way through he turned giddy and came down I then went up meaning to come to close quarters with the coon when about two feet off him he made a clear spring of thirty feet to the ground were he was speedily put an end to On Tuesday we skinned the coon and got it ready for cooking for as we had heard that the Yankees eat them we determined to do so too At supper we had roast coon which was all very well if we had not known what it was but as we did and had spent some hours skinning it it was all we could do to do our duty to it On Thursday an Indian came round in a canoe selling a deer he had shot W bought half of it for fifty cents As we are on an island where there is only one settlement and that consists of three houses we have to go to Comox in Vancouver Island for all supplies The sailing is not very good as the wind is apt to get up quite suddenly Jubilee Day 117 The last time we crossed it was very bad indeed and we came very near to being capsized We were very nearly flat on the water and two thirds of the sail and mast were underneath There are some most beautiful hummingbirds here a sort of bronze all over They have backs which shine like gold in the sunlight bright crimson throats and long curved beaks Yesterday Herbert saw a panther nothing very dangerous but not a nice customer As it was Jubilee Day we hoisted the Union Jack on a tree just by our camp In the evening we drank the Queen s health in punch Jsa 
 IX The Way we Live Now More Exploring A Fine View A Sudden Squall We Decide to Leave the Island The letter which begins this chapter was written by the lady of the party encamped upon Texada Island June Where we are now is a little nook in a very pretty bay It is a lovely place but when I say that there is scarcely a yard of level ground you will understand that it has its drawbacks We have as I dare say you know a tent for W and myself another tent on the top of a little hill close by for the boys and a hut which serves for kitchen and parlour Sailor John sleeps in the sloop The Way we Live Now 119 The ground our tent is pitched on is very uneven I have to run up a hill to get to the washhand basin and I invariably slide down backwards once if not twice There were rather deep holes where we made our bed but W filled them up with pieces of rock then we put pine boughs then moss after that a canvas blanket cover a buffalo robe and finally blankets It was really very comfortable but lately W has made a really grand bedstead as he thought it better to be further from the ground besides it gives the spiders and beetles more trouble to get at us The hut is a great convenience We have our stove in it with shelves for our stores It has it is true no door and no windows and three fourths of the floor are gone but there is enough left for us W and the boys have now made a table and four good benches and we get on admirably well They as you know are busy exploring the island and I sometimes go with them r 120 The Way we Live Now But exploring is not an easy thing in this country No words indeed will adequately describe the places that have to be got over Sometimes there are large masses of rock covering the ground and there are smaller pieces everywhere Then there are very thorny rose bushes with small very red sweet smelling flowers by the way and blackberries a very pretty shrub called sal lal ferns fir trees and any quantity of other bushes and trees Then the ground is covered at intervals with fallen trees Every few yards you have to get over one Some you can step over but most require a good climb As for trying to go round them that is out of the question for many of them are over seventy yards long Many of the large trees that are thus lying on the ground are quite rotten and have a number of young fir trees some of them quite tall growing all along their trunks Sometimes they are useful for helping us to cross swamps I am getting The Way we Live Now 121 quite used to walking along them over hollows that are unpleasantly deep Swamps there are in abundance and lovely lakes these latter full of trout The boys have caught a few of these but I look forward to o their getting more when they become more skilful Deer are in plenty but it is now the close time for them However we have had a taste of them for two Siwashes Indians came over the other day in a canoe the Siwashes seem to be allowed to kill them at any time and W bought the hindquarters of one for fifty cents and some tobacco It was most delicious meat Sometimes I know you will like to know how we fare we have cod from the bay John cooks it cut up in pieces with onions and tomatoes It is eatable in this way but not a very good fish after all I am head cook though John and indeed all help John has some Greek ways of dressing things which make them palatable The bread at first 122 The Way we Live Now was a great trial I brought some bottles of yeast from Victoria and made a dreadful mess of the first batch Perhaps I used too little yeast anyhow the loaves would have done for ballast Eventually they were sunk in the harbour and I assure you that they went down like lead At last I made some yeast for myself Since then and especially since I have been able to have some of that excellent Winnipeg flour I have managed very well We have hot rolls for breakfast Imagine that Sometimes John makes them sometimes W or the boys Then there is a supply of pilot bread or biscuits to fall back on One day last week they killed a coon and when they had skinned it thought that they would like it cooked for dinner I remonstrated faintly but was overruled Indeed I could not refuse when they offered to prepare it And prepare it they did and very nicely too so that it looked just like a hare At first they left the eyes in but it The Way we Live Now 123 looked so dreadful that I never could have basted it especially as it had to sit with its head out of the oven door Even after the eyes were taken out it had a quite dreadful grin Still when it was cooked it really looked very nice and W and the boys seemed to eat it with great appetite As for me I got off with a very small piece But then see the inconsistency of these creatures Suddenly when we were eating our pudding W said That coon was a trifle green and one of the boys said I am glad I ate it and yet somehow I wish I hadn t and the other chimed in So they all joined in vilifying the poor beast I was not altogether surprised when I remembered that they had had their noses over it a good part of the afternoon But coon is not an every day luxury For food generally we have fish tinned meats and soups cheese butter syrup cake pie or pudding and of course very admirable bread The last thing at night we m 124 The Way we Live Now generally have some chocolate Our great want is green vegetables though the canned are tolerably good Milk of course we have none except the condensed As for clothes the place is simple destruction to them Cooking and walking through the bush would finish anything W and the boys dress if you can call it dressing anyhow but W always puts on a collar for service on Sunday I kept to collars as long as I had any clean Now I wear embroidery I have made vain endeavours to starch some collars myself but somehow they won t come stiff But I mean to try again We have some minor plagues The mosquitoes are not much to complain of but the midges in the evening are a great pest Not that they make any difference to me but W and the boys complain of them loudly Small flies I am glad to say do not trouble us either in the house or out The Way we Live Now 125 of doors Other insects are innumerable the ants are simply enormous and there are bright beetles like those that are sometimes 0 worn for ornament There are crowds of mice and I am always patching bags that they have eaten through Yet they are so tame that one does not like to be hard upon them There are numbers of butterflies and some very pretty birds some of which have a very nice song but not so nice I think as our larks and blackbirds at home There is one W says that reminds us of home with its note something between a postman s knock and a policeman s rattle The crows of which there seem to be whole flocks are not musical When we first came they used to gather round our tents in the early morning and waken us with their quarrelling The boys thought of throwing boots at them but were afraid they would carry them off Besides the crows there are eagles in abundance The boys shot two fine specimens The Way we Live Now the other day When I tell you that there are panthers in the island I shall have about completed my list One of the boys had a little adventure with one of them some short time ago He went down into a swamp to cut a stick for a fishing rod and lo in the bush which he had picked out there was a panther lying He had nothing but his axe with him The panther happily moved off and so when he had got his stick did the boy So no harm came of it but he had a scare So my dear M this is the way we live now July We are getting on a great deal better now Yesterday we came across some really good land We dug into it and found there were ten feet of very good peat This with the quantities of dead fish which are thrown up would make exceedingly good manure Without much difficulty we could get tons of it to the More Exploring I2J harbour at low tide and ship it away Things look much brighter than they did a few days ago You will be glad to hear that we are both remarkably well The large amount of exercise which we take is making us grow like one o clock especially the sculling and rowing You will guess what it is like when I tell you that the waistcoats which were made much too large for me will not now meet across my chest by some two inches Also it is almost out of the question to button the coats The pilot coats are now just a nice fit and are without exception the most comfortable things for wear that we ever came across You just put one on and lie down anywhere with something for a pillow and you feel as if you were in a feather bed for softness and warmth We are both very brown and I think that you would consider us very dangerous looking ruffians if you saw us when we go exploring in the bush Long boots corduroys a 128 More Exploring check shirt and a felt tennis hat with the brim well pulled down form our costume Sometimes we carry a rifle or a hatchet The long knives too add something of the ruffian to our appearance I have not looked in a looking glass for over a month now and what is more have not the slightest wish to do so To day we went out to follow the course of a certain stream and fix the position of some swamps We found about fifteen acres of swamp and bottom land and a biggish lake On the other side of this was a howling wilderness of rock and forest We found another stream running into the lake and followed it After an hour s hard walking we found ourselves within five minutes walk of the place from which we had started The stream had wound about in the most extraordinary fashion Once we saw a splendid buck within easy range It stood still and looked at us But alas we had not the rifle More Exploring 129 We also found that the beavers had been mending and raising an old dam within the last twenty four hours There were lots of footmarks so there must be some about still The Siwashes however have killed most of them In a day or two we go further down the island Here we hope to find larger stretches of good land July As you have been some time without a letter I will give you a description of what we have been doing during the last few days On Wednesday the three of us rowed about four miles down the island to find a new camping ground We went to a bay where there is a river running out We hope to find some good land somewhere along the course of this We found an old hut in very fair condition The only drawback was a large hole burnt in the middle of it by the Siwashes But this we can board over We 9 130 More Exploring came across one or two deserted logging camps and shot a brace of grouse On Thursday we rowed to a Siwash village where there is a Roman Catholic mission Most of the inhabitants were out fishing or shooting The Padre was also away so we started home again We rowed considerably over twenty miles that day and the sun was awfully hot In first crossing the channel we sighted a huge whale It gradually got nearer and nearer to us and then disappeared After a bit it suddenly came up about thirty yards to one side of us making straight in our direction W and I were rowing and you bet we didn t stop to watch We made the boat go pretty quick and the whale passed just by our stern Coming home we saw no less than seven whales in different parts of the channel now while I am writing I can hear them blowing On Saturday we went to camp by the river which we found on Thursday We rigged up a tarpaulin for More Exploring J3i K and W and Dick and I found a nice little hollow behind a tree under some bushes First we spread a waterproof sheet then folded our coats into pillows and with our guns and knives handy lay down and pulled the blankets and another waterproof sheet over us We were very comfortable indeed as the sal lal bushes on the top of which we were made a sort of spring mattress It was necessary to have our arms ready as we were some five and twenty yards from the camp fire and the whole place was swarming with gray wolves On Sunday we took a walk up the river After going some way we came to a splendid fall The river ran through a narrow gorge about thirty feet broad The whole gorge was on a tremendous incline and it was headed by the fall where the water came sheer down some twenty feet We could feel the ground shake quite a quarter of a mile away and a large cloud of mist and spray hung over the falls We then 9 2 J 132 A Fine View climbed on to a hill which was near and from there saw the grandest piece of scenery I have come upon since we passed the Selkirks The river came from a large lake several miles long and one or two broad All round it were steep hills covered with timber and in the background rose the Cascade Mountains capped with snow In the evening there was the mosfmagnificent sunset that I have ever seen It was really beyond description I was looking over the smooth sea dotted all round with little islands and lit up with a bright red light Behind the sea rose up the mountain range along the coast of Vancouver Island while behind them again were the snow mountains their white peaks shining with a brilliant flame colour the clouds just above the mountains were edged with the same hue and the whole sky was reddened with the light This lasted about half an hour and then the whole sky changed to a wonderful steel gray which was almost as beautiful though quite A Fine View 133 different You could not realize a quarter of its beauty from the best description I only hope you will be able to see something similar soon when you come out here There is lots of fun in camping out here and the scenery is very grand indeed almost too grand and rugged I think For my part I should like to see a little bit of the scenery you get green fields and farmhouses better than all the mountains in British Columbia Before long however I hope we shall be doing something towards making part of the scenery a little less wild Perhaps then the rest will become pleasanter by contrast July The day we posted our last letters to you we went to Comox in the sloop The wind fell almost directly after we had started so we had to pull the sloop by means of the two sweeps a man at each We pulled here twenty two miles and can feel it now in our left hands which got rather cramped Coming 134 A Sudden Squall back next day the wind again fell in somewhat of the same way We got out the sweeps but after we had been pulling for two hours a regular storm got up suddenly and the sea was running very high indeed in less than ten minutes from the time when it had been like glass We were only just able to beat round the point ahead of us If we had failed to do this I don t know what would have happened Once round that we made good time down to the harbour We have been doing a little prospecting lately for minerals but have found nothing except a few small veins not worth troubling about The place is all jumbled up by earthquakes and upheavals and things of that kind so that it is almost impossible to find really large ledges or veins We shall not stay in this island much longer There is not sufficient good land to make it worth our while to start a farm here After all I think we shall go back to our old plan and make our way to Calgary Of We Decide to Leave the Island 3S course it is rather a disappointment not finding anything here but still it is plain there is nothing and so we must make the best of things PART III ALBERTA 
 X We Move North West OnaRanche About Taking up Land Wild Duck Shooting Calgary August You will be somewhat surprised to see the name at the head of this letter We have been here now about three days and have been looking out for work This I m glad to say we have got it is on a horse ranche five miles from here The pay is 15 each a month and board The arrangement is only for a month but we shall stay on longer if we can agree with the man about wages 15 is very low but as we saw no immediate chance of better we determined to take it The country round here looks very nice as far as we have seen but we cannot of course 140 We Move North West judge yet Perhaps you would like to hear something of our journey here We took seven days to go from Comox to Victoria in the sloop the distance is about 140 miles Of these we had to pull at least 80 as we had either no winds or head winds The only fair wind we had was in Victoria Harbour a little too late for use We left Victoria on a Sunday at 2 a m reaching Vancouver at 9 We had a bath and something to eat and then started to come up the Fraser River Valley The mosquitoes nearly crowded us out of the cars I never saw anything like them All the inhabitants wore nets over their heads We crossed over 1 200 bridges ranging from 5 feet high and a yard or two across to 300 feet high and 300 or 400 yards long In some places the mountains were very smoky though not nearly so bad as represented in reports Certainly though there have been very large fires about When at Comox we were offered 20 On a Ranche 141 a month each and board on separate farms I was for taking it but Dick didn t like it and so we came here I hope you like the eagle s wings We are both in excellent health You would be amused to see us riding about on our Mexican saddles which are by the way awfully clumsy and uncomfortable They weigh 30 lb and sometimes more The ponies are the scrubbiest looking animals I have ever seen yet they carry you wonderfully well over the roughest ground The saddles have what is called a horse in front on which you sling your lasso and anything else you wish to carry with you The stirrups are large wooden affairs with leather in front to keep bushes from catching your feet Our plans must depend on seeing land which we like The money I think we can save as the wages we can get will be from 20 5 to 40 10 a month and board Hi 142 On a Ranche and we shall have very few expenses It does not seem much to start on but we can get 320 acres of land for 20 5 in fees and for living on it 320 more for 1 per acre to be paid in three years if we still want the land We ought to start soon so as to get land near the town It costs very little to live if you have cows and poultry and one or two small things of your own to help you on and if necessary one could work out part of the time with a team and earn 60 12 a month By the way a first class team and waggon would only cost jo other prices are equally low so we could start a good many small things to be gradually increased Living here is of a somewhat simple nature in fact pork damper and tea damper pork and tea and tea damper pork are the varieties in which we indulge Occasionally however bread is substituted for damper We get up now at 5 30 Dick milks and L About Taking up Land H3 I look after two thorough bred horses At 6 30 we breakfast and then draw hay off the prairies Twice a week one of us rides round the fences to see that they are in good order We hope soon to get on to a farm where cattle require to be herded as that will give us good opportunities for inspecting the land round The country seems to be a very fine one It consists chiefly of great rolling hills with streams winding amongst them The mosquitoes however are simply awful Calgary is a very go ahead town and is growing at a tremendous pace September The son of our host here has told us of two good spots about forty miles from Calgary that is about a day and a half s journey by waggon They are valleys bordering on streams with plenty of timber at hand There is plenty of natural hay and a considerable amount of game During the winter there is rather 144 About Taking up Land more snow than in Calgary which is a decided advantage This place I speak now of the best of the two is within easy reach of the projected railway from Calgary to Edmonton which is to be commenced next year To get a place nearer Calgary besides being hard to do would not be any greater advantage over a place forty miles off as under that distance no good amount of timber can be found If possible we want to secure some land in the district I have spoken of and to do this we must be quick as considerable tracts of land are being taken up every year We have just seen in a paper that a large party of Ontario farmers had started West from Winnipeg to spy out the land If we cannot get this place we shall have to go more than forty five miles from Calgary which means another day s journey and this would make a great difference Now if we could borrow 200 we should next spring buy a team and waggon and go About Taking up Land 145 for a week up country to fix on a location If we found one that satisfied us we should come back send in our claim to the land office work out for six months and in the succeeding fall enter into possession finally I think by that time we shall have had sufficient experience to start for ourselves as we shall have been out here for two and a half years By next fall we shall have about 100 of our own to add to the 200 which we should borrow This would give us a great advan o o tage in starting as it will enable us to get things that will bring in a return the next year We expect to be able to pay back the whole interest and capital in three years I think I have given all our plans and thoughts on this subject Tell F that all round Calgary and the North West generally there is splendid pike fishing Where we are now we often change our salt pork for jack steaks and very good they are We catch them with a spoon bait from 10 146 About Taking up Land a canoe and they give very fine sport the general size is from 4 to 12 lb I forgot to say that though we should buy our provisions for the first six or nine months yet we should doubtless be able to supply ourselves with fresh meat by means of our guns and rods T had better not come to us before we have been settled six months as during that time we shall be roughing it a bit and it would not do for him to do too much at first Tell him to try and if possible learn how to thatch both houses and haystacks To day Dick and I have just returned from Calgary Dick rode down looking a regular cow boy on a small white cayeuse or Indian pony with a huge Mexican saddle and stirrups with huge leather flaps to them He wore his old gray coat and a large gray felt sombrero on his head altogether he looked an awful ruffian I drove down with Mr G the owner of About Taking up Land 147 this ranche as I am unable to walk owing to an accidental stab which I gave myself with my large knife I was trying a dodge for opening it with one hand and it half opened without my knowing it and so I ran it about two inches into my right thigh I was quite lame yesterday but can get around all right to day The tourniquet braces came in very useful for bandaging as we had not our regular medicine chest with us We went into town chiefly to make use of a note of introduction to a Mr M He was very kind indeed and has taken all our luggage into his strong room till we get fixed for ourselves We told him exactly how we stood and he promised to write to a friend of his and get us places for the winter with a company which is working up at Reddeer River He also said that we ought to start for ourselves at once if possible and said we could do so very well indeed with 200 to 300 He very much approved of our ideas as to how and 10 2 Y 148 About Taking up Land with what stock we should start He was also very much taken with the notion of bee keeping Very little is done here in that way and so we could command almost any price we wished for honey Fowls also he thought well of and said they alone could feed us eggs fetch 30 cents a dozen he also said that when we had land fenced in we ought to keep sheep He told us there would be difficulties and losses to contend with but that if we made up our minds to succeed we were bound to do it Further he gave us a note to the land commissioner or agent asking him to help us in the choice of land and said that when we fixed on any section of country we might come to him and he would show us the reports of the Government surveyors on that particular part Then we ought to go on a few days trip to see the land and if we liked it take it up If you object to the idea of borrowing we can wait till we have saved enough to start but the About Taking up Land 149 result would be to place us further from Calgary and we might not get such good land By the way you will find I think somewhere in my diary which I sent off to day an estimate we made when we first thought of the plan The prices named for horses and cattle are high but I think it best to get first rate stock at a high price and not second rate beasts the first always command a certain value and with the second you can never be sure of getting more than half what you paid for them Our first object Mr M said is to get land with good hay on it good timber near or on it and with good water This kind of land is getting harder to obtain every year so you see we ought to hurry We left British Columbia firstly because the climate is so hideously wet in winter and spring and secondly because what land is not already taken up costs from 5 to 30 per acre to render it fit for cultivation This 150 Wild Duck Shooting climate as far as we can judge is much superior A few days ago we went out duck shooting in the slough there is about two feet of water standing in it and any amount of mud So we put on old clothes and had a fairly good time The duck were very wild so we only managed to get five brace during the afternoon Our guns have turned out very good ones and are the admiration of all that see them We could if we liked get 2 more than we gave for them for people are always offering to buy them But we shall stick to them as good guns are not always easy to get out here 
 XI Haying A Buck Jumper We Buy a Team Breaking them in September You will see by my heading that we have left our last place We went first to a ranche on S Creek which is twenty five miles south of Calgary and were there for a week haying This was rather a tough job To begin with we got a lift for twelve miles after leaving Calgary but then we had to leave our valise behind and carry our bedding on our backs and walk over eleven miles of rough prairie We got to the haying camp late in the evening to find that the high wind had blown the tents down and had rendered it almost impossible to cook so we had supper 152 Haying off cold salt pork and sour bread which you could pull out in strings a yard long There was a severe frost every other night and we had not enough bedding and so could hardly get to sleep By the way if you get T any blankets to bring out mind and get double ones that is two large ones sewn together Single ones are worse than useless a pair of double ones is the only thing to have Dick and I if we get permanent employ ment for the winter are going to invest in a buffalo robe as a supplement to our bedding A fellow who is leaving here has two to sell SMI 1 r i u H ne only wants for each and the usual price is 6 to y After we left the haying camp we came to P Creek which is half way to Calgary and are now living in a log hut with an English fellow who has been out here five years He offered to let us make his shack our headquarters till we should get fixed for the winter It will save us an awful lot as hotel charges here are L A Buck Jumper J53 gigantic A day or two ago we went out shooting and got three brace of snipe and a prairie chicken or two They make grand eating after living on salt pork and beans One job we are trying to get is that of cutting rails We should take a tent stove and some provisions and go up into the bush for the winter and spend the whole time cutting and piling rails which could be drawn away by teams every day We ought to be able to make from i to 2 a day each besides our food We may go up to Reddeer fifty miles north of Calgary to work for a ranching company there We don t yet know what sort of work this last would be but that does not matter much as long as it carries us over the winter This morning I tried to get on the only available horse to go to a neighbouring ranche It was a broncho which three months ago was running wild in British Columbia but my right leg being still a little stiff from the cut I got a fortnight ago 154 A Buck Jumper I was not quick enough in getting properly seated before he started to jump and kick around bucking as it is called here He threw me a complete somersault I landed with my feet in the air my shoulders reaching the ground first it took my breath away completely for a time and for two or three minutes when I did breathe I roared like a broken winded horse only rather worse However I got H and Dick to hold him while I got seated When I got to my destination two and a half miles away he was so much cooled off that I was able to bring our valise and 4 lb of butter back though I had to walk him all the way October I am glad you like the skins they are hardly worth taking any trouble about still if we go north we may be able to send you a few better ones Yesterday I saw the rancher from Sheep Creek about cutting some rails and he said he could not say if we We Buy a Team could have the job yet which means he does not want us Also I saw the manager of some lumber mills here he said that he had promised all his places but that if any men failed to turn up we might have the places It would be 25 s a month each and board to last till the place froze up one to th ree monttisl ns morning M who is to write to a getting us places on the ranche at Reddeer Calgary Fall Show is on now If there is a chance it would be a very good notion for Teddy to get into the way of thatching the great difficulty here is to make a good roof We are seriously thinking of buying a team of horses waggon and harness at once then getting a few provisions and starting out for a week or ten days looking at land Our reason is this we can hear of no work just yet that is for a fortnight or three weeks and we want to be doing something mean m We Buy a Team while If we could not get work for ourselves and team and I think we could during the winter a fellow here has promised to keep the team all winter for the use of it Another reason is that horses are so much cheaper now than in the spring and if we can get two mares we can get a return for our money next spring if we care to sell the colts If we do get work for them it means i a day extra besides their keep Again if we start for ourselves next year it will save us a lot of time if we don t we shall get bigger wages and be more independent as we shall have private means of locomotion Probably long before you get this we shall have cabled for some money it would take something between 40 and 50 to do it We have lots of shooting now and have great feeds of wild duck grouse prairie chicken and snipe the last are awfully good When I was in Calgary last I was We Buy a Team lS7 unable to get back for two nights the second I spent at a house three miles from here very nice people indeed English too Dick shot a skunk just outside the shack but its skin is not worth taking as the hair is not tight in Yesterday morning a lot of prairie chicken came and woke us up by running about on the roof H and I slipped out at once but they flew before we could see them however we each got one as they went There are seven or eight hanging in the cellar now We go to Calgary on Monday to see about the team p S We have just cabled for 40 I believe we have something like this amount still of our own There is a team going which we cannot let slip We are now going into Calgary to buy it waggon harness and all After that we shall start for a week s exploring October I am sorry not to have written to 158 We Buy a Team you before but somehow a wandering sort of life does not seem conducive to keeping up a correspondence Next year if we have a place of our own you may expect more letters I hope you and A will come out and see us as soon as you can I can promise you lots of sport wild duck prairie chicken snipe deer bear black grisly and cinnamon wolves gray timber and prairie also trout and pike fishing If we take up land on little Reddeer River all on the estate except the grislies and cinnamon and they will be within a few miles and with them mountain lions a kind of puma We are feasting now every day on duck chicken or snipe which we can shoot sometimes without going ten yards from the house The snipe are the best eating we have had for a very long time I have just been trying a dodge for washing flannel things with ammonia I think it will answer The trial I gave it was very Breaking them in hard as the things were exceptionally dirty This winter in all probability we shall stay where we are now except when we get work at any distance off If we are not able to get work for the winter for wages we shall stay here working with our team for board and lodging and that of the team also The work will consist of hauling logs to build stations from the bush to here and also in hauling hay to Calgary for sale At present we are engaged in breaking in our team We get an occasional job for a few days helping with the harvesting etc We were very grateful for the draft We received it or rather the bank did the day after we cabled and owing to its coming so quickly we were enabled to buy a splendid team of bay mares before they were shipped with a lot of other horses to Ontario We have also bought a waggon and a set of double harness with the money we saved this v i6o Breaking them in summer by our work So we shall in future have a team and waggon and we shall have a four times better chance of getting work this winter than we have had before We gave 40 for the team It consists of two bay mares one dark and the other light one is three years old and the other four They do not stand very high but they are what is called low heavies that is with short legs and heavy bodies very clean cut and neat and not by any means what would be called bulky They will in another year s time or so when they are full grown be very strong Everybody who has seen them has admired them and when they are thoroughly broken in they will be worth from 50 to 60 We are going to call them Belle and Vi It was rather a big business breaking them in as they were awfully wild Three days ago we started on the work and this is what we did first of all we separated a small Breaking them in 161 bunch of horses from the main herd which was running free on the ranche this bu nch we drove into a corral or enclosure We then drove out one by one all the horses except the two we wanted then we fastened up the corral and began work We first proceeded to lasso one of them When this was done the three of us held on to the other end and pulled with all our strength the horse in the meantime rushing madly about the corral rearing and jumping striking with its front feet and lashing out behind After about ten minutes a difference became apparent It had been lassoed with a slip noose so it began to gasp and roar and as the noose became tighter round its wind pipe to stagger and reel and finally fell over its tongue hanging at full length from its mouth perfectly black and dripping with blood It however regained its feet again by a terrific struggle but only to fall a second time Then two of us sat on its head and another ii 162 Breaking them in tied its four feet together We then put a strong rope halter on and took the noose from off its neck After a few minutes it began to revive and tried to get on its feet The end of the halter was next tied to the horn of the saddle its feet were untied and one of us pulled it round the corral by main force After a while we were able to hold the halter by hand and slowly approach it tickle its ears and pat its neck All this was done with the greatest caution as the least quick movement would have terrified it After a rest one of us would hold the halter while another went at a respectful distance and drove the horse with a whip EVery time it flung itself about a jerk of the halter would tend to convince it that it was no longer its own master When a few hours of this sort of thing had passed it became comparatively tame though when first tied up to the wall of a stable it Breaking them in 163 flung itself against the wall till huge bruises were raised over its eyes and on any prominent parts of its head We drove them about eight miles and put them into another corral for the night and 0 gave them hay The next morning we had to throw it again repeating the choking process in order to replace a broken rope on its halter For about three hours we led it with a halter one going behind as before till it would allow itself to be led without anyone driving it The other horse was treated exactly in the same way and both are now fairly submissive Yesterday we put the harness on them for the first time as all we had done so far was merely halter breaking a very small fragment of our labours We started off to fetch them after breakfast When we got there we led them round a bit and took them to water and then started home each leading a horse About half way home we changed our mode of progression 11 2 w 164 Breaking them in i and I went ahead holding a rope with each hand Herbert going behind and driving them After about ten minutes they took it into their heads to get frightened and both bolted off at full speed I hung on for about forty yards and then had to let go as I had absolutely no check on them only holding each with one hand the rope pulling through my hand blistered and rubbed the skin off all my fingers After about fifteen minutes we cor nered them up against a fence and managed to get hold of the long ropes attached to their halters and then resumed our way home arriving in about half an hour We then tied them up to posts at first they pulled back and flung themselves about a bit but soon got used to it We next slowly put the harness on during which they stood unusually quiet After leading them round separate with the harness on we tried to hitch them together and then we had a great commotion They twisted all about and finally one threw itself Breaking them in 165 breaking its bridle to pieces I sat on its head while Herbert separated it from the other Then a fellow we knew arrived with a horse he had just bought and which had been worked before So we hitched them together not till after a tremendous struggle as his horse although it had been worked was much wilder than ours However after a regular fight during which it struck out with its fore feet at a tremendous rate giving me two whacks one on the leg and another on the ribs but doing no damage we hitched them to an empty waggon and drove around They both went fairly quietly one of us holding the reins and another holding the halter rope In the afternoon our mail was brought to us from Calgary I don t think there is any chance of our going back to British Columbia as we are very much pleased with Calgary To be sure butter is 35 cents a pound but for us that will be a greater advantage than draw 166 Breaking them in back For the last month we have had beautiful harvest weather not a drop of rain We live regally sometimes having snipe or teal or cold duck for breakfast roast duck or grouse for dinner and sundry wonderful puddings of our own manufacture We have now a regular supply of wild duck as we shot five brace two days ago they are in the cellar hanging We each consume half a duck at a meal sometimes a whole one This morning we fetched a load of hay from the stacks the colt going very well After fetching the hay we let the horses feed for half an hour and then put the other colt in the waggon for the first time she ran at full gallop for about two hundred yards and then quieted down and we fetched a load of fence rails and posts Herbert and G then drove to a place two miles off to see some logs etc and I stayed behind and put up a small corral to put hay in so as to keep stray animals from eating it After two hours they Breaking them in 167 came back the colt quite tamed down Tomorrow we shall drive the two new colts into Calgary when I shall post this letter October The team is really a splendid one Both mares are in very good condition and well matched They pull tremendously We had one of them out the other day getting a load of logs for building and when the waggon got into a mud hole she pulled steadily and so strongly that the old horse in with her could not hold his own and was pulled back against the load and then the hooks came off the whiffle trees and she nearly turned a somersault We fixed up again and she pulled almost the whole load out by herself We have not worked the other one since we drove them to Calgary she got hot then and going through a creek gave her a chill resulting in a slight attack of water farcy her hind leg swelling up to twice its right size She was very quiet while we bathed it as soon Breaking them in as she found that it relieved her It is nearly right now and she is feeling in such good spirits that this morning she tried to have some fun with Dick and got on her hind legs to pat him with her fore feet somehow he didn t see the joke We have been building a log stable and have got it about half done it will take about fifty logs to build it I shall be glad when it is done as it is rather hard on the horses having to stand out in the cold with no shelter We are not getting wages now but I don t think our time is wasted as we get our own and horses feed and we are breaking them as well as learning log building when the team is fairly broken we shall have a very fair chance of getting work at any rate for most of the winter We don t intend to regularly cultivate our ground in the way of raising crops for sale we should only plough and sow enough oats to feed our work horses poultry and pigs Breaking them if 169 twenty to thirty acres would more than cover it Our chief interest would be dairying and O poultry as there is a good sale for butter and eggs etc in Calgary I don t think working out here would give us enough experience to pay for not having land of our own as all that people do here is to run cattle out on the prairie put up hay for food and grow oats I think we can learn better by treating our cattle according to good books than by foi 0 0 lowing the methods used here by the usual run of farmers which are reckless to an extreme and by which they lose great quantities of stock and render their horses almost unmanageable Our team which we have only handled for about ten days is now a good deal gentler than the majority of old teams round here As to good land there is not any unoccupied nearer than twenty five miles from Calgary We want to get land which we can stick to for ever and ever I don t see 170 Breaking them in much good in getting your land into good shape and then selling it We don t look upon it as an investment but rather as a means of getting a permanent and independent livelihood and perhaps something more This country will be just the place for T as it is a sure cure for asthma 
 XII A Fight with a Prairie Fire The Team turns out Well The Wintei Winter Here Sport During the November On Sunday week October 30th we had a great fight with a prairie fire I had driven into Calgary the day before On Sunday morning I saw the fire an made out that it was about seventeen miles off and not far from home I started at once and driving back as fast as I could got here at 12 30 Dick and H were just setting off We changed horses had something to eat and started The fire was then about a mile away and we reached the place at 1 15 About twenty men were already i 72 A Fight with a Prairie Fire there We set to work beating with wet sacks and kept this up till io p m when a waggon came along with a supply of food and a raw hide The food was very welcome we had had nothing you will remember since mid day the hide was hitched with long ropes to two saddle horses and started one horse on each side of the line of fire the ropes being about twenty yards long so that the animals were out of the reach of the flames We had put a sack of earth on the hide to weigh it down and there were long ropes at the side with men holding them This was to guide it The rest of the fellows at work went behind with their sacks to put out any spots of fire left by the hide Dick and I were among these and very fast we had to run most of the time for the horses were terribly scared by the flames and went at a great pace We had to keep up with them as well as we could for a spot of fire if left for a minute would A Fight with a Prairie Fire 173 have spread and spoilt all the work of the hide This we kept up till 4 30 a m with not more than five minutes rest now and then when we had to stop and wet the hide Altogether we went rather over thirty miles going round the fire and leaving off about five miles from home By that time every one was dead beat the horses as much as the men There were two teams and thirteen saddle horses at work and those that had dragged the hide in one little coulee or valley where the flames were ten or twelve feet high were singed all over When we got across after the hottest three minutes I ever had or wish to have every one s clothes were on fire Dick had four large holes burnt in his breeches and one side of my shirt was burnt off The fire destroyed a few stacks but did no serious damage What would have happened had it been left no one can tell Such a job I hope never to see again In the little coulee I spoke of it was 174 A Fight with a Prairie Fire like a furnace Every now and then the wind would come in a gust and then the fire would travel faster than a horse could go We got it out just in time for when we had just finished the wind began to blow very strongly and a small piece which we had not put out got up steam and rushed away east at a fearful pace It reached Bow River which was six miles off in less than twenty minutes and burnt a streak as clear as if a road had been made There was another fire burning on the other side of the Bow River This was not put out till a slight fall of snow came and finally settled it Yesterday I drove into Calgary in a go cart a sort of diminutive dog cart The horse a broncho had never been driven single before so I expected rather a lively time especially as the cart was a borrowed one and I had been warned not to drive fast over rough places for fear of its coming to The Team Turns out Well 75 grief Directly the broncho s head was loosed off he went as hard as he could tear over the rough prairie I thought something would break every moment but wonderful to say it held together We are very much pleased with our team they are real good pullers The other day we went to fetch logs from the bush We got four long green logs awfully heavy They are quite twenty four feet long Also we had a shorter one measuring about eighteen feet As the waggon was coupled too short the weight was wholly thrown on the hind wheels over which the logs were just balancing Well after we left the bush we came to a swamp and of course the hind wheels sank in up to the hubs and the waggon stopped We rested the mares about two minutes and then set off again They pulled till I thought the harness would go and the waggon slowly moved out of the swamp This was pretty good considering that they had brought the 176 The Team Turns out Well load about nine miles already Last night we had rather a misfortune Something got into the stable and scared the horses so much that one of the mares slipped her colt It is a great pity as next spring it would have been worth 30 or 40 Dick you will be pleased to hear is bread maker for the establishment At this very moment he is making the dough up into loaves for baking We are both first rate cooks now and can get up an awfully good feed out of bacon beans and flour with a little grease You would not know what was in the stuff and would only think how good it was By the way judging from your last letter you seem to have rather an exaggerated idea of the winter here Seven months long you call it I think We are now in the middle of November and don t expect winter till after Christmas though of course it may come any day But if it came at once it could not last The Winter Here 177 longer than four months probably it will only last for two Ploughing always begins here in March when the frost is well out of the ground We do of course have cold snaps here and when it is cold it is cold and no mistake November At last we have got a touch of winter There is snow on the ground two inches thick and that is as much as they ever have here and last night the thermometer went 7 O down to 18 below zero All yesterday it kept at about 50 below Our cat was a little uncertain as to where she should locate herself The oven door happened to be open and as she sometimes sleeps there after sniffing around she got in But before ten seconds were gone she came out again in a pretty big hurry The oven was a little warm even for 50 below zero Next she got on to the dresser which is close to the stove and tried first with one paw and then the 12 i78 The Winter Here other to see if the stove top was too hot Apparently it was Finally however she settled down on the plate in front of the stove and remained there for the rest of the day barring meal times This snap of cold has found us a little unprepared We have been adding a new room on to the hut and putting the logs on the roof has shaken down some of the plaster The wind gets in quite a bit However we hope to have everything done in a week s time To day I have been nailing down the floor While doing this I was interrupted by Vi knocking with her foot against the water tub to let us know she wanted something to drink I suppose I had to get up and go out to her They Belle and Vi are wonderfully quiet and affectionate now Yesterday they stood quite still while I was picking the snow and ice off their feet and fetlocks That means something I can tell you for the ice gets frozen on to the hair in large lumps and takes some pulling before it will come off J Sport during the Winter 179 November You said in your last letter that you thought our method of taming horses was a bit cruel Well I guess it can t be helped You see when we get them they are quite wild There are other ways of course but they are far worse than the one we employed There is plenty of water here in the winter and plenty of sport too Snipe in any quantity They are just like the English bird and are brutes to hit as they clear off at a terrible lick before you can get a sight of them But they are awfully good eating Also we have deer wild cats gray wolf and last but not least the mountain lion They the mountain lions don t often come down our way Now and then they make a raid on farms or ranches anything in the way of sheep calves or colts being very acceptable to them They will not however attack a man unless provoked or driven into a corner In the Rockies and in British Columbia there are plenty of them The only objection to the 12 2 i8o Sport during the Winter shooting here is that you have to wade about in a huge marsh with thewater up to your waist This takes something off the pleasure though you don t think so much about it if you are shooting for your larder We are very comfortable here now and like the life very much it is healthy and not too slow Also there is money to be made if you stick at it and don t get into the habit of going into the town too much People seem to find it much harder out here to keep hold of money than to make it As far as we can see the best way to do that is to keep out of Calgary as much as is possible December I suppose this letter will reach you about Christmas time so please give our love and best wishes all round I wish we were at home to help with the provisions as I guess you will miss us a bit in this respect but I know that the others will do their best to make up for us The weather here has be Sport During the Winter 181 come pretty cold now Our team I m sorry to say are looking rather thin We cannot get any oats for them and hay alone is not good to work on In a few days however there will be oats in plenty To morrow we take them to the blacksmith I expect we shall have a fine time as they will be terribly frightened H s team will be worse than ours One of his horses is we think really crazy no matter how kind or gentle you are to him he will take the first opportunity to kick or strike you A few days ago he nearly caught me but I was a bit too quick for him and jumped into the manger just as his heels went whack against the logs 
 XIII A Chinook Christmas A Christmas Gift Horse Breeding Caught by the Cold A Warm Bed A Gay Christmas December We are having a regular North West winter 16 sometimes and then2 or30 above freezing Several days ago we watched the thermometer In the morning at 8 a m it stood at 16 F two hours afterwards it went down to 30 We then started to the bush when nearly there I remarked to H on a peculiarity in the atmosphere ahead of us It looked just as it does when you see the heat rising out of the ground on a hot day Half a minute afterwards down came a chinook on us feeling quite hot compared with the cold wind before Herbert who was about 100 yards behind heard my yell but did not feel Christmas the wind till about two minutes afterwards as it was travelling slowly though indeed it increased to a gale in about an hour s time We were not sorry to get it as we have had an unprecedentedly early and long spell of cold weather As we were going to the wood we shot a partridge and a wood grouse also a whisky John in winter plumage the latter has a body as big as a robin but larger limbs and tail I suppose when this letter reaches you you will be recovering slowly from the effects of Christmas dissipations We I m afraid shall not have much to recover from Our Christmas feed will probably consist of salt pork boiled beans and a jam or treacle tart with bread Possibly we may manage to shoot a chicken or two but they are getting awfully wild now and very hard to kill owing to their enormously thick plumage The chinook that I spoke of has brought splendidly fine weather while I am writing 184 Christmas though it is freezing hard outside as the wind has shifted into a more northerly quarter Two days ago we saddled Belle and Vi for the first time Belle bucked a little over a waggon standing near but was soon quiet again Vi however put her feet head and tail together in real earnest but she slipped and rolled over frightening herself so much that she became quite subdued We do not intend to use them as saddle horses at all but think it as well that they should be broken to it in case it might be necessary M has just told me of a good place ten or twelve miles out of Calgary and we are going out to see it the first chance we get If it is as good as M says we ought to make quite as much as 500 a year out of putting up hay and selling it during the winter in Calgary What we have to find out is if there is good water in the place and timber near at hand We shall have no difficulty in borrowing as it would be as safe an invest A Christmas Gift 185 ment as any out here However if there is any difficulty at all about it I guess we can make a start without it next year if we rustle hard enough What is in favour of borrowing though is that if a man starts with a little capital in this country he can go ahead three times as fast as one who has to rustle his start Through the extreme kindness of a relative the sum of 200 was presented to the two boys in order to assist them in starting for themselves The news reached them on Christmas eve December We have written to X The news of his kindness in starting us free is the best possible Christmas gift you could have sent us You can t think what a lot of anxiety it has taken from us This gives us the sure chance of getting really good land Work i86 Ho rse B reeding and makes us independent to a great extent of outside work The winter is getting on most satisfactorily To day the temperature was above freezing and there was a clear sky and plenty of sunshine We shall stay in this locality now and take land north of Calgary Though all the land for some seventy or eighty miles has been taken to the south of Calgary very little of that to the north has been touched The reason is the difficulty of crossing the Bow River when bringing stock or produce to Calgary This winter however a bridge is being built and will be opened in a few weeks Then of course there will be a rush for the best land and we being on the spot will get a pull over the rest I guess We shall devote ourselves chiefly to horse breeding at present In time we shall get to selling grain and hay Horse breeding how ever strikes us as the thing to pay most both now and in the future Garden fruit we shall Ho rse Breeding have of course but this is rather uncertain owing to the small fall of snow here indeed all kinds of crops here are rather uncertain owing to the summer frosts We are fairly well satisfied with the winter There have been some pretty cold snaps 270 below zero was the worst but mild weather has been decidedly in the preponderance In this country horses are turned out during the winters just like cattle and after the hardest winters have appeared robust and even fat little colts and all Horse breeding will not be such a risky business as it may seem We have not had very much experience it is true but ever since we have been out here we have had more or less to do with them Again in this climate they are subject to very few diseases We shall also keep a few cows and poultry Our work will be something of this sort herding horses morning and evening branding them in the spring and fall putting up hay for the riding and working horses i88 Horse Breeding during the winter harvesting a crop of oats for our own use putting up fences and stables In addition to this after three years time there would be buying and selling to be done and shipping the animals off to Ontario or Manitoba which are the chief markets Of course we shall have to work pretty hard at first putting up our log hut and some corrals etc but we shall not mind that Why doesn t M come out If the idea that he will be of no use prevents him let him forthwith dispel it from his mind We would soon teach him what real work was and make him think himself the hardest worked brute in creation At first of course we would let him off lightly as a greenhorn and a tenderfoot January 1888 We have been having a week of real winter It would not have mattered if we had been ready for it But the shack is not properly plastered there is no hay for the horses as Caught by the Cold 189 the stacks are a mile and a quarter off and the supply of firewood and food is rather low The spirit in the thermometer has not been within shouting range of zero since Monday week excepting on one day and then we all rushed off to the bush ten miles away to get more firewood The snow is so deep now that horses can hardly draw a waggon and sleighs are rare round here Yesterday we borrowed a sort of sleigh known as a jumper it is very low and you sit just behind your team s heels Well we started in this thing to Calgary to get some food When we were three miles on the way we had to stop and get thawed out at a house as the snow thrown up by the horses hoofs had frozen on our faces and made it impossible to see Finally we had to turn round and come home Then I saddled a horse and rode over to a neighbour s and borrowed enough food to keep us going till we can get some from Calgary I forgot to say that just as we got home the 190 Caught by the Cold pole came out of the jumper and the team went on leaving us sprawling in the snow Tell cook that I ve got a new dodge for bread making instead of yeast I think it is the same plan as that used in Palestine by the old Jews The last time dough was made for bread I took a small piece of it and put it aside to get sour to day in making bread I am using this sour piece of dough instead of yeast for we have none of that left The bread is not made yet but is doing very well so far January I suppose that Christmas gaieties have not allowed you much time for writing at least that is the way we account for absence of mail last Thursday Dick and I walked three miles to the post office and back again through snow which was knee deep When we got there the only thing for us was a small circular from some bookseller in Calgary We felt like going on to Caught by the Cold 191 interview him at first but afterwards thought better of it The day before yesterday we went with our team to get firewood and had an awful time of it coming home The snow was drifted three or four feet in lots of places and very often the horses were up to their bodies in snow even where there were no drifts the trail was awfully heavy We had ten miles of this and in order to lighten the horses work walked all the way back and most of the way there and this in a deep snow with a crust not quite hard enough to bear your weight and yet which held your feet at every step We had got nearly home half way up the last hill when the horses gave out and tried to make little rushes t get on not pulling steadily together For a long time we had to stop and let them get their strength again Certainly they had done splendidly There is some talk of Dick and myself o 192 A Warm Bed going to the bush to camp out and cut rails for two or three weeks It seems a tempting prospect living in a tent with the thermometer often going down to 20 and 30 F However a tent is very easily warmed only it gets very cold when the stove is out Still if we go we shall have lots of bedding I will tell you how much to see if you think I it enough First a tick filled with hay on top of this one half of a double blanket then ourselves then the second half of the double blanket and on top the two big white blankets and the two blue ones we brought out with us then the two heavy ulsters the two waterproof sheets the two white waterproofs and the pea jackets indeed a man needs a steam crane to lift the bedclothes in order to get up but once in you do not find it a bit too much The waterproofs go half under and half over the bed and keep draughts from getting between the blankets You talk about fancy dress balls and dinners A Gay Christmas l93 etc and then say the Christmas has not been so gay as usual Why to us poor devils living in daily fear of losing some portion of our flesh from frostbite with one long round of bacon and beans it sounds like a paradise We are considered quite old stagers here as people know we have been both in Ontario and British Columbia and don t know quite how long either so we can talk of greenhorns 13 
 XIV Blizzard Out in the Bush Another Team Driving Downhill We take up Land Preparing it for Habitation We all Try to get Drowned February You must excuse the long interval between this letter and our last as we have been camping out in the bush for seventeen days cutting posts and rails By the way you need be under very little anxiety about the blizzards you hear of in the N W States hurting us We have them much modified only two or three people were frozen to death in Alberta this last one When it came on we were two and a half miles from home with Belle and Vi and a slight sleigh It was awfully sudden and we could not see ten yards in front Out in the Bush 9S of us and felt nearly suffocated by the wind but Belle and Vi knew what was wanted when we turned their heads home and all we had to do was to hold on while they really tore home straight across the prairie in what I think must have been a bee line for the shack as we were home in less than no time Our thermometer did not go below 22 to 17 F until the wind had subsided when it went down to 300 F We had rather a nice time in the bush as we were really warm there being no wind among the trees We worked all day in our shirt sleeves There were only three cold nights in one of which the thermometer went down to 2 50 F that was our last night there Three days before we caught an awfully pretty little brown owl about four inches long and his head larger than all the rest of his body he was splendid at keeping the mice out of the tent He was frozen to death on that last night which was a great 13 2 Out in the Bush pity as he was very tame and would eat from the hand There were no animals to be seen except birds though we saw lots of wolf trail and heard them howling and yelling all round at night They woke us up one night when they were killing a cow about a quarter of a mile off the noise they made then was tremendous We saw one bear black trail and followed for two miles with our guns but it got so dark we had to give it up Next day the trail was covered with snow By the way the wolves in the bush are called timber jacks and are larger and fiercer than the coyote or prairie wolves they all have splendid furs on now I wish I could get some During the last week in the bush snowstorms prevented any supplies reaching us and for the last three days we had beef straight with a little baking powder and treacle to eat with it and the beef would Beef j straight means beef and nothing else Another Team 197 not have held out for more than two more meals You say in your last letter that G recommends hiding from a blizzard in the snow As far as I have seen in this country one could only follow the ostrich s example and hide one s head and leave the rest to luck not much use in a blizzard I think I said we might be getting some more bronchos any time as now is the best time to break them We saw three yesterday and have arranged to get them if the owner will sell at our price 240 48 for the three February The day before yesterday I rode over to S Creek I was to join another fellow there and together we were going to ride up the creek and spy out the land He never turned up so I slept at a shack there and came back next morning I saw one section of land which I thought would have suited us but it was not possible to examine it properly as the weather was so 198 Another Team bad I suppose you have heard by this time that we have bought three new mares wild bronchos They are getting quite gentle now though two of them are still very nervous one three year old especially The other day we hitched one into the waggon with Vi She ran quite a bit and Dick says that he had for about ten minutes the roughest ride he has ever experienced We also got a little cayeuse or Indian pony to do our rough riding till the others are better able to stand it It was on him that I rode over to S Creek When I started I left Dick laughing at me He said I was quite as big as the pony and ought to take my turn at carrying We are having glorious weather now The snow is nearly all gone It freezes about 200 at night but thaws during the day in fact the winter seems to have quite broken up Last night however there was a snowstorm and the temperature stood at Driving Downhill 199 20 The roads as you may imagine are in a pretty bad condition In driving to Calgary to day I came across a cutting where there was about six feet of water and slush Consequently I had to go down a place which was something very like perpendicular I give a small plan of the incline which is no exaggeration at all Belle and Vi had to stiffen all four legs and slide for about twelve feet to get down without upsetting I had to brace my feet against the front pf the box and lean back with all my might holding on to the reins in order to keep them up Happily the snow was pretty deep so it was not so slippery as it might have been 200 We Take up Land March We should have written last week but we were both so awfully busy that we had not timie and I did not feel up to writing last night to catch this morning s mail as I had just come in from a forty mile ride and was a bit tired We have taken up land here about twenty two miles from Calgary and in a fairly well settled district We have each homesteaded 160 acres and each pre empted 160 acres making in all 640 acres It is a nice little valley well sheltered on all sides and with lots of natural hay on it and within easy reach of timber it is about a quarter of a mile from Sheep Creek a good sized stream which boasts of splendid trout fishing We shall also buy eighty acres of Canadian Pacific Railway land that is adjoining it in order to get possession of certain springs which are open all the year round We shall be allowed ten years to pay for it so it will be all right not more than j 8 a year It is almost necessary to We Take up Land 201 buy this eighty acres if not absolutely as the land we have taken cup would decrease in value if we did not as there is not water on it through the winter If we did not take this section we should have to go much further off or take up an inferior one Belle had her first long ride yesterday about forty miles and came through the ordeal very well indeed though she was a bit tired In the evening I went to her and found her lying down I sat on her shoulder and patted her She was not a bit frightened most horses won t stand anyone near them when they are lying down We bought a stallion last Saturday for 225 45 it was a very good bargain and a chance not often got or we should not have bought it It took down our cash account quite a bit but as we shall be working out all the summer it will be no inconvenience and we have no debts It will save us its own value in two years besides the work it does and it is a 202 Preparing it for Habitation splendid team horse and wonderfully gentle We shall camp out in a tent on our land next week I think and put up a log house and do a little fencing and ploughing Then we shall work out till the winter except for three weeks to put up our own hay Herbert is at C Ranche about eighteen miles west of Calgary buying another mare We shall sell our saddle pony and one of our saddles to help pay for her You thought in your last letter that going in for horses would bring us into connection with a low set But here it is quite different two thirds of the ranchers go in for cattle and it is impossible to draw a distinction between cattle dealers and horse dealers regarding their characters from what I have seen the proportion of gentlemen among horse raisers is quite as great as among cattlemen and farmers Our experience of them is that they are very decent fellows and quite straight and bearing excellent characters through the Preparing it for Habitation 203 country In fact the horse dealers are quite a different sort of people here to some that are to be found in England though there are black sheep here as well as anywhere else We were at an auction the other day and bought a mower rake and stove and two or three other things very cheap which saved us quite a bit among other things we picked up a turning lathe very cheap it will come in handy in winter evenings Our money is invested as safely as it could be and as we mean to do a lot of work this summer we hope to show you a model ranche

whose land adjoins our own and are working tremendously hard hauling logs to build our house and Preparing it for Habitation 205 rails to fence with The house of course will take some time After we have done that we shall turn to the fencing We shall want about a mile and a half of that As soon as the frost goes we shall break thirty acres as we want to get a crop next spring We shall have a few potatoes and vegetables in this spring A man who lives near here told me the other day that once when he was fishing in the creek he pulled out about eighty pounds of trout This may be a little tall but still it shows that the stream is a pretty good one He said also that none of the fish weighed under a pound Last Sunday I had a small adventure with a horse in the pasture here I was trying to catch him Well I got the lasso round his neck but he got a start on me and as the ground was very slippery and I was on foot I could not stop him so he pulled me over I thought that if I hung on to the rope a bit 206 Preparing it for Habitation perhaps he would stop but I guess he didn t The further he went the faster he went and after doing ten miles an hour over hard rough frozen ground for the distance of some two hundred yards I decided to let go I got rather bumped and am stiff now from it Dick then went to the stable to saddle Bull the stallion and run the horse in He had broken out of the pasture and when he arrived at the stable a quarter of a mile from the hut there was our friend standing with Belle and Vi You talk about the difficulty of getting a good house in England now Here we have to be thankful if we can t crawl in and out through the walls In our last residence we could see through them on all sides However we have determined that ours shall be a model house I hope the determination will last May We have been hard at it all this Preparing it for Habitation 207 month hauling logs and lumber for the house Three or four days ago we had just started home with a load from the bush where we had been at work when we got into a morass The wheels of the waggon sank in as far as the axles I had just time to get one of the horses on to firm ground but Belle sank till she looked as if she were lying on the ground 0 0 We unharnessed her got her out and started again having thrown off half the load We hadn t gone half a dozen yards when she got in again deeper than ever She pulled till she was so embedded that she could only move her head We were pretty near two hours before we managed to get her out She did exactly what we told her in the way of lying still and jumping or rather trying to jump At one time I thought we should have had to pull her out with the logging chain and the other horse We did not get home that night and had to put up at a friend s house ten miles off 208 We all Try to get Drowned When there is not a heavy load on the waggons we ride on the coupling between front and hind wheels Of course when we cross S Creek the water comes over this and as there is no higher place to go to we have to grin and bear it The water is snow water from the mountains and as you ll guess not remarkable for its warmth Yesterday we went to Calgary When about seventeen miles off we saw a rainstorm coming down from the mountains so we raced it Belle and Vi did the distance without a stop and hardly seemed at all tired We arrived ten minutes before the storm We got back from Calgary to day all safe in spite of mud holes and swollen creeks But we nearly all came to grief at F Creek owing to false information Two men whom we met told us that it was not too deep to cross with a load When we got to the bank it looked to me too deep but as they had just crossed we determined to go We all Try to get Drowned 209 by what they said We hadn t gone three yards when I saw what was up Still it was no use turning back then A few yards more and the horses were out of their depth and the stream began to take horses wao gon and all along with it Belle and Vi however did not see the fun of this and did their best to struggle across Fortunately they got foothold on some shingle We then waited till the stream slewed the waggon round on OD to the same bed and then unhitched them and got them to the other side The next business was to unload the waggon as quick as we could for the water was rising fast We did all we had time for and then hitched the two mares on to the end of the waggon pole They pulled it out and about nine hundredweight of lumber with it Had this happened fifteen feet lower down there would have been little chance of saving either waggon or horses as the banks are four or five feet high and perpendicular and there is a good 14 zio We all Try to get Drowned fifteen feet of water The waggon too was pretty heavy having got thirty three hundredweight on board By the way you asked for a description of Dick He is a little taller than when we came out and very much broader His face is the colour of a mahogany sideboard L and I think if he were to appear in B in his usual costume there would be a general stampede out of the town P S Mab has got a little colt which does nothing else but run races all day with its own shadow 
 XV Our House Work and Play Doing a Hay Contract Rest after Toil A Misfortune May Having finished chinking and plastering we are at last installed in our new house and are very comfortable It is twenty four feet by twenty inside which is considered big in this country and indeed it seems so to us after having lived for some time in a house twelve by fourteen There is a sod roof on and we are going to put lumber over it though as yet the rain has not come through There are two windows and we shall make another as soon as we have time Our cellar is six feet square There is a timber partition up the middle of the house in one half we have the stove and cook in the other we sleep 14 2 212 Our House sit read etc There is going to be a veranda in front when we have time We have ploughed a fire break round the place and a corral to one side of it to keep the colts in while we are breaking in their mothers There is also a snubbing post close to the house that is a post fixed into the ground very tight used for tying wild horses to while putting on the saddle or harness during the breaking in Our water comes from a hole we dug in the coulee a few yards in front of the house In the room we sleep in there is a table in one corner a double bed in the one next to it in the third corner the big trunk known generally as the Woolwich Infant and in the last a lot of sacks of oats for the horses We sit at present on our two gun cases placed across two kegs of nails In the kitchen there is a stove at one end with the cooking things hung up behind it a pile of oats heaped up in one corner saddles harness and bridles in the other Work and Play 213 We have broken in Queenie to the saddle When we first put the saddle on her she bucked tremendously but quieted down afterwards The next day she bucked even worse than before and when I got on her the first thing I knew was that I had lost my stirrups which were much too long for me and I 0 slipped on one side one leg over the saddle and one under her body It was awfully hard work to hang on while she bucked I clung 0 0 with one hand to a strap round the horn of the saddle and I guess it skinned my knuckles just a bit Until to day she used often to run away with us going round in a circle so small that it seemed possible to touch the centre of it We did not buy the Canadian Pacific Railway land after all they asked too much and we found water on our own place There is a clump of timber on one corner of our section and we can get all we want beyond within a few miles by paying 50 for a 214 Work and Play timber permit Timber land costs 5 an acre besides the surveying fees Our house faces south west and we get a glorious view of the Rockies which we can see through the window when lying in bed We are trying now to get a contract for putting up hay for some of the people round here I think we shall manage it June We are just finishing railing in our pasture land For the last week Dick has stayed all day in the bush cutting and piling rails while I hauled them down to our place We landed four loads a day that is about 200 rails and took about two hours and a half to each load so you can guess that we have had good busy days Towards the end of the week Belle and Vi thought that they had had about enough of it and became rather bad tempered They didn t show it to me but would bite and kick one another This summer we intend to break in a new Work and Play 215 team Mab and Dolly enlarge our pasture land to 180 acres and put up about thirty tons of hay for our own use Then we want to get a contract for hay at the S Creek Ranche I went to see the manager and made him an offer he will let me know in a day or two whether he takes it or no I rode over to see him on Queenie When we got to the river two dogs began to jump about and bark on the other side so my lady insisted on walking down the river till I was just wet through and madder than anything with her On the whole though she behaves very well considering that she has only just been broken to the saddle Everything round here is looking beautiful just now The birds are present in flocks We have had no time for fishing yet though the river is not 500 yards from us Our room looks quite jolly now We have put up some bookshelves and the photos also our bats rackets and guns The round 2l6 Work and Play log walls show the things off very well Dick has been trying unsuccessfully to sketch the house lately but he makes it look rather like a pigsty so I won t send any of his attempts just yet July We have started putting up our own hay twenty five or thirty tons and everything is going splendidly We are having grand weather no rain at all till last night when there was a short storm which could do us no harm as We had stacked all the hay that was raked up We have ten tons in the stack and about as much more lying on the ground cut To morrow morning I shall hope to cut enough to finish it After that I have twenty five tons to cut and rake for a neighbour at 75c per ton This will be three days work Then we start on a contract we have got for the R Ranche at 2 62 per ton This we expect will keep us going to the middle of September After Work and Play 217 that we come back to our own place and put up stables and fix up generally for the winter besides training Queenie for the October races Since she has been broken in she has shown a good deal of speed and two or three fellows have been after her One man offered me a big mare and a horse for her We hope she will take the half mile or three quarters of a mile We expect to clear over 300 on the 200 tons contract If we do we shall be able to put in the whole time till next haying on our own place Yesterday as I was running the mower driving Vi and Mab Mab s colt kept getting in the way and had one or two near shaves of getting her feet cut off in the knives So I stopped the machine and we tried to catch her As we had no long rope to lasso her in the open we ran her into the corral and roped her there Though only ten weeks old she fought furiously I did not think she was strong enough to do any harm and so was 2l8 Work and Play m slightly careless how I handled her She suddenly got up on her hind legs and hit me on the nose with one of her forefeet making it bleed and knocking me down After that I was more careful Mab and Dolly are now broken and are wonderfully gentle A few days ago we went fishing for two evenings and caught seventy four trout running from half a pound to two pounds and a half The whole outfit weighed seventy seven pounds Two rods were going one day and one the next The baits we used were little gilt minnows and salmon flies also spoon bait of the size used for black bass For about an hour the first evening they would get on just as fast as you could throw the minnow in haul the fish in and unhook him One big one got away from Dick with a spoon and another with a minnow in each case breaking the gimp There is an awful quantity of mosquitoes here now In the early morning or evening Doing a Hay Contract 219 we cannot do any work without a smoke to work by and we have to set smudges smokes going for the horses On Friday I came across a piece of ground where one could make a tennis lawn very easily It is quite level and very fairly smooth Hay Camp September You will be surprised at not having heard from us before but I have been quite unable to post a letter though I ve had one written in my pocket for some days We have been camped here for about a month We got the contract that I mentioned before and have got to get the hay up by September 15th There are 200 tons of it We had about ten days wet weather to start with which delayed us a good deal so now we have to rustle in good earnest We have been working seven days in a week from 5 a m to 8 p m I think we shall just manage it if the weather holds 220 Doing a Hay Contract I m afraid you would not think much of our camp if you saw it The cooking place is just eight feet square and consists of four posts in the ground and a few boards nailed on to three sides Our sleeping place is a tent eleven feet long by six broad Four of us sleep in it and it is lucky that the nights are cool or we should be roasted alive Last night we helped to tie up a wild cow a hundred yards from camp A cow boy had separated a cow from the herd and was trying to drive it to the ranche to be killed for beef but as he was on a bad horse he could not do it He lassoed it over the horns and yelled to us to bring a rope and help him The end of his lasso was round the horn of his saddle and he was holding it in We went up just outside the cow s reach to throw a rope round its forelegs The cow made for us and the lasso became so tight that the cow s horns touching it now and then made Doing a Hay Contract 221 it sound like a banjo string if it had broken there would have been some ticklish work as the cow was perfectly furious However we managed to throw it over and then it was killed September At last we are through with our hay contract It has only got to be measured and paid for now We were awfully glad when it was finished and have been taking it easy ever since We have put up another three tons for ourselves and I have cut about ten tons more for a neighbour Most of our time however since the 15th has been employed in shooting and fishing Some of the fish we catch are being salted for the winter Dick goes down regularly in the morning and catches about fifteen pounds of trout Yesterday we both went and just at the south west corner of our place we found fresh deer trail and a few minutes later saw two deer Unfortunately we only 222 Rest after Toil had shot guns with us and loaded with small shot so we had to leave them The ducks are now in full swing and the geese are beginning to show up Also there are quite a number of prairie chickens around We ought to come out of our hay contract pretty well I think It has cost us about 150 in labour and provisions and we ought to get somewhere between 550 and 600 for it 1 October I have only just time to write a line We had rather a misfortune last Saturday afternoon Nearly half our contract hay was burnt by a prairie fire just before the ranche took it over Thus the loss falls on us About seventy or eighty tons went worth 200 so that we shall only clear about 125 now for our summer s work We had to put in all Saturday night keeping a look out on the fire and since we came A Misfortune 223 home have had a saddle horse always ready in case of a wind getting up and scattering the burning hay over the prairie and firing the range There are two big fires raging around one twenty miles off the other about six They will not trouble us however unless a big west wind gets up I was out shooting this afternoon and got four brace three brace of prairie chicken and one brace of ruffled grouse called wood partridges here There are immense quantities of game round here but one is entirely dependent on luck in putting them up without a dog When T comes out he ought to bring a setter It would really pay as we could then without any difficulty keep the house supplied with fresh meat While I was shooting Dick was fishing and caught two trout one weighing two pounds and the other two and a half pounds To morrow we go into Calgary to get some things for the winter After that we shall not I hope 224 A Misfortune have to take a team in till next spring Bull goes with us to be sold though I m afraid it is rather a bad time of year for selling THE
