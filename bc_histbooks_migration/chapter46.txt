november at last we have got a touch of winter there is snow on the ground two inches thick and that is as much as they ever have here and last night the thermometer went 7 o down to 18 below zero all yesterday it kept at about 50 below our cat was a little uncertain as to where she should locate herself the oven door happened to be open and as she sometimes sleeps there after sniffing around she got in but before ten seconds were gone she came out again in a pretty big hurry the oven was a little warm even for 50 below zero next she got on to the dresser which is close to the stove and tried first with one paw and then the 12 i78 the winter here other to see if the stove top was too hot apparently it was finally however she settled down on the plate in front of the stove and remained there for the rest of the day barring meal times this snap of cold has found us a little unprepared we have been adding a new room on to the hut and putting the logs on the roof has shaken down some of the plaster the wind gets in quite a bit however we hope to have everything done in a week s time to day i have been nailing down the floor while doing this i was interrupted by vi knocking with her foot against the water tub to let us know she wanted something to drink i suppose i had to get up and go out to her they belle and vi are wonderfully quiet and affectionate now yesterday they stood quite still while i was picking the snow and ice off their feet and fetlocks that means something i can tell you for the ice gets frozen on to the hair in large lumps and takes some pulling before it will come off j sport during the winter 179
