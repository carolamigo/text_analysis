september this week we began drawing in peas of which there are fifty acres i had to level it straw and all and tramp it down this was very warm and dusty work sometimes i sank down into it three or four feet deep i rather liked it as there was some satisfaction in seeing a heap about eight feet high trampled down quite level for it is very soft the waggons were unloaded in four forkfuls the fork being worked by horse power and fastened on pulleys on tuesday morning i herded cattle it was awfully hot so i drove them a slight relaxation 35 down close to the bush and getting into the shade went to sleep the cattle did the same so i had an easy time of it in the afternoon i helped to stow away sheaves of barley in the barn in the evening we all drove to a ball in c and had a jolly time we came back the same night arriving at half past two next morning we got up at seven worked till breakfast at eight and then went to tramp peas and stow oats before breakfast on saturday i was half way home from the stream where i had been watering a colt when a train came running along the line which is about ten yards from the road the colt shied and threw me off on to my head i got a goodish cut on it but nothing more happened except that i was stunned for about a minute after dinner i fished in the stream at first i used grasshoppers for bait with shot or float i got a few small ones this way the biggest i got by using only a piece of pink string on friday 3 2 36 a 4 slight relaxation night we went to another ball at c which was rather a big affair there were about forty people there the woods about here are now beginning to change the virginian creeper has turned a deep red and looks splendid as it hangs down from the trees if
