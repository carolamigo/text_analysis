july as you may like to have a more accurate account of our work here is an extract from my diary saturday up at six a m watered and groomed tiny and cleaned out his stable milked two cows and fed the calves they eat like little pigs at eight breakfast after breakfast harnessed tiny to the buggy life at the farm fetched the sheep down for one to be killed and then took them back after dinner herded cattle up beyond the old farm there were heaps of wild strawberries and raspberries brought the cattle back at five had a bathe and milked two cows monday up at six a m and bathed the foreleg of the mare with hot water also had to milk her as the colt was not allowed to go near her then did some hoeing in the garden and had a bathe after breakfast and dinner did a lot of various little jobs tuesday up at six a m and milked the mare again shifted some pea straw out of the barn after breakfast unloaded a waggon of hay and got very hot as we were in a hurry expecting another load which by the way never came in the afternoon we played a lawn tennis match with the b club herbert and i life at the far m 1 won both our doubles and singles i played the captain who said he had not been beaten for three years when i was running the horse rake the other day i had a slight shine or two with lucy who was in the rake once she reared up and nearly broke the shaft which brought the boss round to see what was up in pretty quick time yesterday i got up at six as usual and after a piece of bread and butter was set to work at some weeding in the garden i usually go and fetch the cows it had been raining all the day before and during the night too the clothes i wore were large straw hat flannel shirt pair of blue serge trousers socks and top boots at eight o clock i came in to breakfast which consisted of ham tea bread and butter after breakfast i went out and picked raspberries growing on canes or bushes about life at the farm two feet six inches high this i did till twelve my back was then beginning to ache we then had dinner which lasted about half an hour i picked more raspberries till two p m afterwards i helped herbert put a team of colts into the carriage and we went off to play a tennis match at c the day i have just described was one which we should term decidedly easy as we generally have not to pick fruit except when there is a large supply wanted another reason was that it had been raining off and on for the last week and thus delayed the haying which had just begun we found that hard work and no mistake three days ago we had a picnic to the shores of the georgian bay we bathed and ate wild strawberries and enjoyed ourselves very much the roads here are awfully rough now and then they are varied by patches of corduroy roads which consist of trunks of trees this makes a good deal of bumping hi aymg m
