october the team is really a splendid one both mares are in very good condition and well matched they pull tremendously we had one of them out the other day getting a load of logs for building and when the waggon got into a mud hole she pulled steadily and so strongly that the old horse in with her could not hold his own and was pulled back against the load and then the hooks came off the whiffle trees and she nearly turned a somersault we fixed up again and she pulled almost the whole load out by herself we have not worked the other one since we drove them to calgary she got hot then and going through a creek gave her a chill resulting in a slight attack of water farcy her hind leg swelling up to twice its right size she was very quiet while we bathed it as soon breaking them in as she found that it relieved her it is nearly right now and she is feeling in such good spirits that this morning she tried to have some fun with dick and got on her hind legs to pat him with her fore feet somehow he didn t see the joke we have been building a log stable and have got it about half done it will take about fifty logs to build it i shall be glad when it is done as it is rather hard on the horses having to stand out in the cold with no shelter we are not getting wages now but i don t think our time is wasted as we get our own and horses feed and we are breaking them as well as learning log building when the team is fairly broken we shall have a very fair chance of getting work at any rate for most of the winter we don t intend to regularly cultivate our ground in the way of raising crops for sale we should only plough and sow enough oats to feed our work horses poultry and pigs breaking them if 169 twenty to thirty acres would more than cover it our chief interest would be dairying and o poultry as there is a good sale for butter and eggs etc in calgary i don t think working out here would give us enough experience to pay for not having land of our own as all that people do here is to run cattle out on the prairie put up hay for food and grow oats i think we can learn better by treating our cattle according to good books than by foi 0 0 lowing the methods used here by the usual run of farmers which are reckless to an extreme and by which they lose great quantities of stock and render their horses almost unmanageable our team which we have only handled for about ten days is now a good deal gentler than the majority of old teams round here as to good land there is not any unoccupied nearer than twenty five miles from calgary we want to get land which we can stick to for ever and ever i don t see 170 breaking them in much good in getting your land into good shape and then selling it we don t look upon it as an investment but rather as a means of getting a permanent and independent livelihood and perhaps something more this country will be just the place for t as it is a sure cure for asthma
