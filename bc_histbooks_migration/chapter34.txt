june last monday we went for an exploration up to the north end of the island passing by a spot where a forest fire had raged it was positively awful walking all the fallen trees being out of sight and covered with a thick undergrowth we reached the sea on the other side and stopping to rest for ten minutes started home again about a mile and a half from home we saw a coon scuttling up a tree so we went for it and when we reached the foot of the tree w went up after it 8 2 n6 a savoury dish when near the top he began cutting it off half way through he turned giddy and came down i then went up meaning to come to close quarters with the coon when about two feet off him he made a clear spring of thirty feet to the ground were he was speedily put an end to on tuesday we skinned the coon and got it ready for cooking for as we had heard that the yankees eat them we determined to do so too at supper we had roast coon which was all very well if we had not known what it was but as we did and had spent some hours skinning it it was all we could do to do our duty to it on thursday an indian came round in a canoe selling a deer he had shot w bought half of it for fifty cents as we are on an island where there is only one settlement and that consists of three houses we have to go to comox in vancouver island for all supplies the sailing is not very good as the wind is apt to get up quite suddenly jubilee day 117 the last time we crossed it was very bad indeed and we came very near to being capsized we were very nearly flat on the water and two thirds of the sail and mast were underneath there are some most beautiful hummingbirds here a sort of bronze all over they have backs which shine like gold in the sunlight bright crimson throats and long curved beaks yesterday herbert saw a panther nothing very dangerous but not a nice customer as it was jubilee day we hoisted the union jack on a tree just by our camp in the evening we drank the queen s health in punch jsa
