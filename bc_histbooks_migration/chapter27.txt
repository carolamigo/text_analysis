march i was sorry to hear the unsatisfactory news which you gave of the x s i should have thought they would have succeeded if anyone would but it is very hard to make grain farming pay unless you have a very good capital to start with and besides this they have had very bad corn seasons lately in manitoba now about going north west first i must try and disabuse you of the notion that reasons for moving north west the work there is harder than it is here in this place the work begins at 6 a m sometimes at 4 30 on a small farm it begins regularly at 5 in both cases it continues till 8 or 9 at night as all the time you are working in conjunction with other men you have to work your best for if you fall behind it becomes twice as hard at once in the north west work on a cattle farm would begin about 5 and would not last so long except on extraordinary occasions perhaps once or twice a month we should require to be in the saddle all night as well as all day but the work would not require nearly so much strength as it would be chiefly herding cattle after the first trouble of getting used to spending so much time in the saddle it would not fall so heavily on us of work in the north west i only speak from what i have heard of the work here i have had experience still if we found cow boy life too hard we would try to get work on other 78 how to start in a small way farms this would not be hard i understand as to living it would be much the same as it is here of course we should hav to camp out a good deal at night but that would be a blessing and not a hardship if we go on to a ranche in the north west we could in a year or two save enough to start with as the wages there are high when we have done this we should take up a little land two to three hundred acres and keep bees poultry and a few cows also we could grow fruit in addition to this we should keep a team and for the first year or two one of us might hire j o out with the team by the day whenever we had no work of our own for it he would earn 2 or 3 a day and so would help the farm considerably this would require very little capital to start and is one of the most paying branches of farming the two of us could take up three hundred acres of land and by complying with the requirements of the land office by cultivating a part of how to start in a small way 79 it could in three years time get complete possession of it then if we found we wanted capital we could sell part of it say fifty acres which if you had worked pretty well and had land well situated would fetch from 500 to 1 000 you see therefore that time is a consideration to us everybody we meet advises us to go we shall earn good 0 o wages there as by that time we shall be competent book keepers here the wages are miserably poor people pay labourers as little as they can and get as much as possible out of them for that little though the boss has said several times that it is best to stay here he actually thought seriously at one time of giving up the farm here and going north west himself we shall get on well with riding there and after we have acquired some experience there of cattle there will be no difficulty in getting passes to british columbia if we should wish to try that another good reason for 8o how to start in a small way going is the climate here as the residents o o g themselves confess it is detestably changeable by the way we have both taken to wearing cholera belts so that the weather however suddenly it changes cannot affect our insides we are going to speak to the boss to night about getting off in the beginning of may and as to the chance of getting cattle passes as we shall be unable to let you know what way we go in time for your answer to reach us you had better send the 30 at once if everything goes as we hope we shall not have need for anything like this sum still it is best to be on the safe side and you may be sure that the money will not be spent unnecessarily the short time which we have put in in this country has taught us to be economical a cheque will i think be the best way though perhaps a draft is safer what you said about woollen underclothing is certainly right even on the hottest summer days when from the nature of our work we return of spring 81 have to wear cotton shirts a thin vest is always advisable you asked some questions about the way of living here for breakfast we have meat and bread and butter ad lib the meat during the winter is beef either fresh or salted at dinner meat potatoes sometimes cabbages or beans and turnips also puddings of different kinds occasionally soup takes the place of pudding for tea there is meat again fruit and bread and butter there is very little hardship about the living
