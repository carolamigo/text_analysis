january i suppose that christmas gaieties have not allowed you much time for writing at least that is the way we account for absence of mail last thursday dick and i walked three miles to the post office and back again through snow which was knee deep when we got there the only thing for us was a small circular from some bookseller in calgary we felt like going on to caught by the cold 191 interview him at first but afterwards thought better of it the day before yesterday we went with our team to get firewood and had an awful time of it coming home the snow was drifted three or four feet in lots of places and very often the horses were up to their bodies in snow even where there were no drifts the trail was awfully heavy we had ten miles of this and in order to lighten the horses work walked all the way back and most of the way there and this in a deep snow with a crust not quite hard enough to bear your weight and yet which held your feet at every step we had got nearly home half way up the last hill when the horses gave out and tried to make little rushes t get on not pulling steadily together for a long time we had to stop and let them get their strength again certainly they had done splendidly there is some talk of dick and myself o 192 a warm bed going to the bush to camp out and cut rails for two or three weeks it seems a tempting prospect living in a tent with the thermometer often going down to 20 and 30 f however a tent is very easily warmed only it gets very cold when the stove is out still if we go we shall have lots of bedding i will tell you how much to see if you think i it enough first a tick filled with hay on top of this one half of a double blanket then ourselves then the second half of the double blanket and on top the two big white blankets and the two blue ones we brought out with us then the two heavy ulsters the two waterproof sheets the two white waterproofs and the pea jackets indeed a man needs a steam crane to lift the bedclothes in order to get up but once in you do not find it a bit too much the waterproofs go half under and half over the bed and keep draughts from getting between the blankets you talk about fancy dress balls and dinners a gay christmas l93 etc and then say the christmas has not been so gay as usual why to us poor devils living in daily fear of losing some portion of our flesh from frostbite with one long round of bacon and beans it sounds like a paradise we are considered quite old stagers here as people know we have been both in ontario and british columbia and don t know quite how long either so we can talk of greenhorns 13
