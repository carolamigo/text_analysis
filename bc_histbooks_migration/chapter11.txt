september we are still hard at work harvesting and shall continue to be till the 28 a hot corner end of this month on thursday and friday we were threshing barley and wheat the dust was something awful not getting the wheat done in one day we started again the next and in the afternoon did o a full hour s work in thirty five minutes the machine men were rushing it my place was at the end of the straw carrier dick was next i passed it to him at the rate of thirty forkfulls a minute and he kept pace but the man next him could not and a great pile rose up next dick compelling him to fork higher and so i had to pass the straw higher too we built a stack twelve yards long by six yards broad and about twelve feet high in the thirty five minutes the whole passing through first my hands and then dick s on monday p b and i drove twenty miles to a place where we had business we walked the horses the whole way there as we had a cow tied on behind we started at eleven a m and how to drive in the dark 29 got there at half past eight with an hour s stop halfway after something to eat we started back again at ten p m this time without the cow but after we had gone a couple of miles we had to stop as it was so dark that we could not see over the horses ears i made my way to a neighbouring farmhouse which we could see by its light and fell into a ditch and ran into two fences before i got there i bought a lantern for fifty cents and returned i found we had driven right across the road and that the horses were standing in a large ditch about three feet deep so you see we only stopped just in time the only way we had of driving before we got the light was to go as straight as we could till we felt the side wheels of the buggy going down into the ditch and then to pull the horses a little the other way till we felt the other ditch we hung the lantern on the dash board of the carriage and started again by its light we could see about two yards ahead of the 30 finishing the grain harvest horses we got home about eight next morning both very sleepy all yesterday i was following a self binding reaper setting up the sheaves as the thistles were plentiful my hand became rather like a pincushion full of pins on wednesday i bought some common cotton shirts to work in when barley had to be couched as the beards stick into the flannel ones and make them feel like hair shirts the flannel our shirts were made of was too good and the perspiration made them shrink awfully at first they ought to have been of much coarser flannel
