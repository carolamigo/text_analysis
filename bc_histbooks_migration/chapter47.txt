november you said in your last letter that you thought our method of taming horses was a bit cruel well i guess it can t be helped you see when we get them they are quite wild there are other ways of course but they are far worse than the one we employed there is plenty of water here in the winter and plenty of sport too snipe in any quantity they are just like the english bird and are brutes to hit as they clear off at a terrible lick before you can get a sight of them but they are awfully good eating also we have deer wild cats gray wolf and last but not least the mountain lion they the mountain lions don t often come down our way now and then they make a raid on farms or ranches anything in the way of sheep calves or colts being very acceptable to them they will not however attack a man unless provoked or driven into a corner in the rockies and in british columbia there are plenty of them the only objection to the 12 2 i8o sport during the winter shooting here is that you have to wade about in a huge marsh with thewater up to your waist this takes something off the pleasure though you don t think so much about it if you are shooting for your larder we are very comfortable here now and like the life very much it is healthy and not too slow also there is money to be made if you stick at it and don t get into the habit of going into the town too much people seem to find it much harder out here to keep hold of money than to make it as far as we can see the best way to do that is to keep out of calgary as much as is possible
