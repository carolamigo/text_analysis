december it was snowing hard all day here on christmas eve during the morning and the best part of the afternoon the snow was very soft and wetting we got nearly wet through the only things that did not let in the wet were the corduroys however about half past four it began to freeze ferociously and one s coat got as hard as a board and crackled when one moved one s arms about when i brought my team into the stable they were covered with snow and ice nearly an inch thick and i had to scrape it off with a large 56 a little real cold knife used for topping turnips that night the six o clock train passed b at twelve having been snowed up at a place thirty miles south of us we did not have an extra great time on christmas day we went in to service at ii and got out at 2 15 then we had a small sort of lunch and did nothing more till 5 30 when there was a great feed we had no work to do that day as we had arranged with the man who does most of the feeding that we should give him a goose and he o o should do all the work he proposed it and we were very glad to accept his offer thank you very much for the graphic and illustrated the pictures will very nearly finish covering the walls of our room which are half covered already we have got some really heavy snow here now and some pretty bad drifts last evening about 5 30 t and i started in the cutter a single horse sleigh to hold two or three to fetch p from a place four miles from here we had nearly arrived there when a little real cold si we got off the beaten track it was snowing so hard that i had to let the horse take his own way and trust to his keeping on the track and in less than half a minute we went slap into a deep drift the horse and cutter stopped dead and when we got out the snow was just up to our arm pits and i could only see part of the horse s neck and his head as we had lightened the cutter by getting out the horse managed to pull it through the drift and we started again with our pockets and clothes stuffed fiutof snow when we came back we managed to keep what little track there was but we had to walk the horse most of the way this morning six more inches of snow had fallen when we woke fortunately there was no wind but if it does blow at all the roads will be nearly impassable we are getting some pretty severe frosts now and f has already had occasion to have his nose rubbed with snow we are wearing jerseys over our shirts and under our 58 a little real cold waistcoats and when it gets really cold we shall start vests and cardigans too we have had one or two small blizzards i wish we could let one loose by way of effect on our friends at home they would never want another dose they are truly awful things the snow freezes in great lumps on your eyebrows and chin and nose every now and then you have to use your hands to open your eyes which get frozen up it is quite impossible to keep the snow from getting down your neck dick is getting horribly fat and lazy every evening nearly when he sits down in the sitting room he goes to sleep and snores loudly the misses b generally wake him up by dropping the cat on to his face or something of that kind
