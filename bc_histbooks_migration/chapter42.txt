october i am glad you like the skins they are hardly worth taking any trouble about still if we go north we may be able to send you a few better ones yesterday i saw the rancher from sheep creek about cutting some rails and he said he could not say if we we buy a team could have the job yet which means he does not want us also i saw the manager of some lumber mills here he said that he had promised all his places but that if any men failed to turn up we might have the places it would be 25 s a month each and board to last till the place froze up one to th ree monttisl ns morning m who is to write to a getting us places on the ranche at reddeer calgary fall show is on now if there is a chance it would be a very good notion for teddy to get into the way of thatching the great difficulty here is to make a good roof we are seriously thinking of buying a team of horses waggon and harness at once then getting a few provisions and starting out for a week or ten days looking at land our reason is this we can hear of no work just yet that is for a fortnight or three weeks and we want to be doing something mean m we buy a team while if we could not get work for ourselves and team and i think we could during the winter a fellow here has promised to keep the team all winter for the use of it another reason is that horses are so much cheaper now than in the spring and if we can get two mares we can get a return for our money next spring if we care to sell the colts if we do get work for them it means i a day extra besides their keep again if we start for ourselves next year it will save us a lot of time if we don t we shall get bigger wages and be more independent as we shall have private means of locomotion probably long before you get this we shall have cabled for some money it would take something between 40 and 50 to do it we have lots of shooting now and have great feeds of wild duck grouse prairie chicken and snipe the last are awfully good when i was in calgary last i was we buy a team ls7 unable to get back for two nights the second i spent at a house three miles from here very nice people indeed english too dick shot a skunk just outside the shack but its skin is not worth taking as the hair is not tight in yesterday morning a lot of prairie chicken came and woke us up by running about on the roof h and i slipped out at once but they flew before we could see them however we each got one as they went there are seven or eight hanging in the cellar now we go to calgary on monday to see about the team p s we have just cabled for 40 i believe we have something like this amount still of our own there is a team going which we cannot let slip we are now going into calgary to buy it waggon harness and all after that we shall start for a week s exploring
