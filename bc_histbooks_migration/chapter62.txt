september you will be surprised at not having heard from us before but i have been quite unable to post a letter though i ve had one written in my pocket for some days we have been camped here for about a month we got the contract that i mentioned before and have got to get the hay up by september 15th there are 200 tons of it we had about ten days wet weather to start with which delayed us a good deal so now we have to rustle in good earnest we have been working seven days in a week from 5 a m to 8 p m i think we shall just manage it if the weather holds 220 doing a hay contract i m afraid you would not think much of our camp if you saw it the cooking place is just eight feet square and consists of four posts in the ground and a few boards nailed on to three sides our sleeping place is a tent eleven feet long by six broad four of us sleep in it and it is lucky that the nights are cool or we should be roasted alive last night we helped to tie up a wild cow a hundred yards from camp a cow boy had separated a cow from the herd and was trying to drive it to the ranche to be killed for beef but as he was on a bad horse he could not do it he lassoed it over the horns and yelled to us to bring a rope and help him the end of his lasso was round the horn of his saddle and he was holding it in we went up just outside the cow s reach to throw a rope round its forelegs the cow made for us and the lasso became so tight that the cow s horns touching it now and then made doing a hay contract 221 it sound like a banjo string if it had broken there would have been some ticklish work as the cow was perfectly furious however we managed to throw it over and then it was killed
