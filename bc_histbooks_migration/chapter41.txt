september you will see by my heading that we have left our last place we went first to a ranche on s creek which is twenty five miles south of calgary and were there for a week haying this was rather a tough job to begin with we got a lift for twelve miles after leaving calgary but then we had to leave our valise behind and carry our bedding on our backs and walk over eleven miles of rough prairie we got to the haying camp late in the evening to find that the high wind had blown the tents down and had rendered it almost impossible to cook so we had supper 152 haying off cold salt pork and sour bread which you could pull out in strings a yard long there was a severe frost every other night and we had not enough bedding and so could hardly get to sleep by the way if you get t any blankets to bring out mind and get double ones that is two large ones sewn together single ones are worse than useless a pair of double ones is the only thing to have dick and i if we get permanent employ ment for the winter are going to invest in a buffalo robe as a supplement to our bedding a fellow who is leaving here has two to sell smi 1 r i u h ne only wants for each and the usual price is 6 to y after we left the haying camp we came to p creek which is half way to calgary and are now living in a log hut with an english fellow who has been out here five years he offered to let us make his shack our headquarters till we should get fixed for the winter it will save us an awful lot as hotel charges here are l a buck jumper j53 gigantic a day or two ago we went out shooting and got three brace of snipe and a prairie chicken or two they make grand eating after living on salt pork and beans one job we are trying to get is that of cutting rails we should take a tent stove and some provisions and go up into the bush for the winter and spend the whole time cutting and piling rails which could be drawn away by teams every day we ought to be able to make from i to 2 a day each besides our food we may go up to reddeer fifty miles north of calgary to work for a ranching company there we don t yet know what sort of work this last would be but that does not matter much as long as it carries us over the winter this morning i tried to get on the only available horse to go to a neighbouring ranche it was a broncho which three months ago was running wild in british columbia but my right leg being still a little stiff from the cut i got a fortnight ago 154 a buck jumper i was not quick enough in getting properly seated before he started to jump and kick around bucking as it is called here he threw me a complete somersault i landed with my feet in the air my shoulders reaching the ground first it took my breath away completely for a time and for two or three minutes when i did breathe i roared like a broken winded horse only rather worse however i got h and dick to hold him while i got seated when i got to my destination two and a half miles away he was so much cooled off that i was able to bring our valise and 4 lb of butter back though i had to walk him all the way
