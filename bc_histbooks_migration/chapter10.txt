august we have at last got all the wheat in and on friday we had our first threshing from six a m till six p m with one hour s stop for dinner at twelve dick was in the wheat mow handing or rather forking out sheaves and i had charge of two colts in the straw mow and had to drive them round to tramp down the straw they had tremendously hard work and were so tired that they did not resist at all when we rolled them out of a hole at the top of the barn on to a heap of straw i thought they would never get lb an awkward customer down safe but they did somehow we got the straw packed in so tight that the sides of the barn bulged out considerably about 500 bushels of wheat were threshed out of fifty acres not very grand was it the boss has been keeping a thorough bred polled angus cow for his brothers it is a great job milking it as it kicks like one o clock it has to have its hind legs roped together and then it jumps around pretty lively as it weighs over 1 500 pounds you may imagine what a business it is it has a calf and charges round in very lively style on every opportunity it will run half a mile to get at a dog the other day it nearly knocked a colt through the stable wall horned cattle are the only things which it is afraid of never having had anything to do with them before i have told you that the housewives have come in very useful so would the looking glass t also on the railway journey if i had but had a pocket comb with me as it was i could an awkward customer 27 only see the state i was in without being able to remedy it about half of the harvesting is done now oats and barley are being brought in three days ago when it was raining we put all the wheat that had been threshed through a fanning mill to separate it from the chaff grass seeds etc i had to supply the mill and it kept me going pretty sharp the quantity of house flies is positively awful they are most irritating and injurious to the temper the heat is fearful i write this letter in my shirt sleeves gasping for breath at every word and the perspiration pouring down my face into my eyes and maddening me almost as much as the flies do the pigs of the establishment have been put in my charge at present there are ten but i expect many more two are being prepared for exhibition and eight for fattening
