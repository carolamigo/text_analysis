march we should have written last week but we were both so awfully busy that we had not timie and i did not feel up to writing last night to catch this morning s mail as i had just come in from a forty mile ride and was a bit tired we have taken up land here about twenty two miles from calgary and in a fairly well settled district we have each homesteaded 160 acres and each pre empted 160 acres making in all 640 acres it is a nice little valley well sheltered on all sides and with lots of natural hay on it and within easy reach of timber it is about a quarter of a mile from sheep creek a good sized stream which boasts of splendid trout fishing we shall also buy eighty acres of canadian pacific railway land that is adjoining it in order to get possession of certain springs which are open all the year round we shall be allowed ten years to pay for it so it will be all right not more than j 8 a year it is almost necessary to we take up land 201 buy this eighty acres if not absolutely as the land we have taken cup would decrease in value if we did not as there is not water on it through the winter if we did not take this section we should have to go much further off or take up an inferior one belle had her first long ride yesterday about forty miles and came through the ordeal very well indeed though she was a bit tired in the evening i went to her and found her lying down i sat on her shoulder and patted her she was not a bit frightened most horses won t stand anyone near them when they are lying down we bought a stallion last saturday for 225 45 it was a very good bargain and a chance not often got or we should not have bought it it took down our cash account quite a bit but as we shall be working out all the summer it will be no inconvenience and we have no debts it will save us its own value in two years besides the work it does and it is a 202 preparing it for habitation splendid team horse and wonderfully gentle we shall camp out in a tent on our land next week i think and put up a log house and do a little fencing and ploughing then we shall work out till the winter except for three weeks to put up our own hay herbert is at c ranche about eighteen miles west of calgary buying another mare we shall sell our saddle pony and one of our saddles to help pay for her you thought in your last letter that going in for horses would bring us into connection with a low set but here it is quite different two thirds of the ranchers go in for cattle and it is impossible to draw a distinction between cattle dealers and horse dealers regarding their characters from what i have seen the proportion of gentlemen among horse raisers is quite as great as among cattlemen and farmers our experience of them is that they are very decent fellows and quite straight and bearing excellent characters through the preparing it for habitation 203 country in fact the horse dealers are quite a different sort of people here to some that are to be found in england though there are black sheep here as well as anywhere else we were at an auction the other day and bought a mower rake and stove and two or three other things very cheap which saved us quite a bit among other things we picked up a turning lathe very cheap it will come in handy in winter evenings our money is invested as safely as it could be and as we mean to do a lot of work this summer we hope to show you a model ranche when you come to see us we send you the temperature fahrenheit for january to give you an idea of our worst month a m a m p m january 1st 1 160 10 26 10 30 2nd 8 15 10 30 3rd 10 90 10 9 4th 11 100 lowest at night 180 5th 8 17 25 6th 9 200 8 7th 9 6 l6 204 preparing it for habitation jan a m uary 8th 9 8 lowest at night 12 o o 28 gale of wind 9th m 10th 10 1 ith 10 12th 13th 14th thermometer out of order 15th 16th 17th 18th 19th 20th 2ist 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 27th 28th 29th 30th 3ist p m io o 24 4 o 24 io 0 io 110 io 0 20 io 22 8 o 25 8 12 8 o 20 8 189 8 0 0 8 22 8 8 8 8 8 33 34 34 0 34 34 lowest at night 250 i 29 o i 12 260 260 i5 12 i8 i 18 i 1 18 18 180 180 o m b era s creek
