april the winter has really broken uj here i think and the snow is disappearing fast the days now are splendidly warm as the sun is very strong but the nights till last night have still been pretty cold about 22 f of frost all the roads are about six inches deep in mud and water lambs are quite plentiful now and the birds are beginning to come back in fact we can both feel 82 return of spring and hear the spring returning we have been breaking in two three year old colts lately one has been in harness four times and has run away twice the other day i rather astonished him i wanted to take him down to the driving horses stable so i caught and bridled him i had quite a job to do it then when he stood still for a minute i jumped on his back he had never experienced anything of the sort before and did not know what on earth to do for about half a minute he stood stock still and then started to go backwards chiefly on his hind legs after doing this for a short time i got him to go forward in a sort of fashion but it was mostly sideways at last one of the men came up behind with a long stick and gave him a couple of whacks and off he went in fine style now he goes quite easily though it is not safe to make him canter or go beyond a slow trot as he would probably try some tricks and we don t want him to get s return of spring 83 into that way i do not get on him now as i m a bit too heavy for him the other colt has only been in harness once he has a pretty bad temper and it would take very little to make him kick furiously also he is as obstinate as a mule all this week dick and i have been cleaning wheat to send to the flour mill at c it is very slow sort of work one turns the crank of the fanning mill while the other keeps the hopper full when we get about fifty bushels cleaned we bag it up and start on another lot fifty bushels or twenty five bags make one load for a sleigh and a pretty heavy load too when the roads are bad drawing out manure from the stable yards has commenced now and we have done a good deal of it still it is not half bad sort of work after all though of course there are other things which are preferable mrs b has recommended that we should get some mittens made here of factory 6 2 84 freeing the mill dam yarn which costs about sixty cents a pound and have them faced with skeepskin she said she would get some of the people round here to knit them for some of our old clothes a good plan i think the ordinary berlin wool mittens cannot stand the rough wear though they are very good and warm to wear when not at work a pound of wool would make four pair the snow has not quite disappeared yet yesterday at noon the temperature was 68 f in the shade and at night it did not go below 5 2 this very moment it is 7 2 in the shade the thaw has been tremendously rapid and on friday which is usually kept as a sunday here we were working all the afternoon stopping ice at the water gate of the dam in order to let the water get away the ice had broken into blocks weighing about half a ton these kept striking against the planks so that we could not take them off we had to stand on the blocks which s freeing the mill dam 85 were swaying and heaving in a fairly lively way and chop the corners off so as to let the water carry them over the edge of the planks the really lively part was getting off after you had set them free and before they went over here is a little sketch of the dam c c c u 3 ii 1 a a a solid immovable woodwork height 12 to 14 feet b movable planks for letting the water go over faster or slower by taking them off or putting them on c c c upright studs against which the planks were held by the force of the water the ice jammed against the top of b so that the planks could 86 freeing the mill dam not be taken off blocks too large to go between c c c had to be stopped last night the ice jammed again and the water rose so high in consequence that it flowed over the top of the dam in several places further along the dam itself was only saved by the centre stud c giving way when of course all the middle planks went with it the height from the top of the planks is about 18 to 20 feet and the water falls on to a platform of large logs we are going to send you two or three skins the mink skin is almost large enough to make a muff you must be careful of it as it is worth something i have been offered 3 50 14 shillings for it already i shot it by the dam four or five days ago this morning we saw the first chipmunk we have seen since the winter began it is one that last summer used to sit on the edge of a roof just outside our window and this morning it appeared in its old place and chattered gait skunk 87 away in a manner peculiar to the species it evidently took a great interest in the dressing process for it watched us intently the whole time just as i was finishing this letter we had an alarm of skunk a fearful odour suddenly began to come in at the open windows and a cry of skunk arose at once dick rushed upstairs and came down with a loaded gun but we could not find the animal for it had made off but even out of doors it was not hard to tell that there had been one part ii
