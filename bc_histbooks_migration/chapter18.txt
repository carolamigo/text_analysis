november the winter is really commencing now a day or two ago we had quite a hard frost the water jugs in two of the rooms were frozen and the cold kept on during the whole of the next day last saturday week a sudden snowstorm came on while we were pulling turnips it was so thick that you could not see a team of horses forty yards away as it was impossible to leave the turnips which we had been pulling to be frozen while lying on the ground we had to go on at it all hands 48 winter occupations and amusements were started to load them on to the carts and waggons this was somewhat cold for the fingers fortunately the storm only lasted half an hour still it left an inch and a half of snow on the ground by the way if not too late the woollen gloves should be like babies gloves a big bag for the fingers and a small one for the thumb those with fingers are next door to useless i got your letter on tuesday at dinner but had not time to read it as i had to go to a threshing we were having a great time threshing just then it lasted all monday tuesday and wednesday we began at seven on monday and threshed out one barn on that day as it is best not to wash the face in the middle of a threshing we did not wash for dinner and so looked as black as niggers the only clean place on the face was just round the mouth where we had to make a road for the provisions washing the face makes the dust stick worse winter occupations and amusements 49 on wednesday we finished the second barn and started on another i was outside on the stack while it was raining snowing hailing and blowing at twelve i drove a man home who had hurt himself a bit as i went straight from the threshing and was wet through when i came back i had a thick coat of mud all over in the afternoon dick was on the stack while i went on horseback to return a lot of sacks which had been lent to the boss when i got back the threshing was over as they had threshed a few peas the dust was very bad dick when he came in had a quarter of an inch of solid mud all over his face and i had to scrape part of it off with his knife before he washed the mud consisted of chaff barley beards and dust he began with goggles on but they got caked over at once it freezes every night now and sometimes in the day the other day it started to freeze about 10 a m after quite a mild night dick and i have 4 50 winter occupations and amusements bought some felt overshoes which go over light shoes such as we brought out and are much warmer than boots they are also snow proof the soles and sides are of india rubber they will last at least two winters everyone here wears them and you can go out to work with only a pair of slippers and these overshoes on in the coldest weather we don t have such early hours now as in the summer we seldom get up before 6 30 or 7 our winter has not begun in earnest yet it is most unusually late the last thing that we have done is moving the large straw stacks formed during the threshing into barns this finished yesterday thank goodness and thus ends the regular work cattle feeding has just begun that is we get up at 6 30 and give the cattle some food to last till we have had our breakfast then they get turnips sliced up by a machine which we have to turn and pretty stiff work it is afterwards they are watered the whole stable is cleaned winter occupations and amusements c i out and the beasts are bedded down with clean straw this takes about an hour and a half and has to be done every morning and evening sundays included dick feeds the pigs fifteen of them and i look after the horses so we do not come in for the cattle work much you will be pleased to hear that dick weighs 11 stone 9 and is increasing he was 10 stone 10 a month ago i am also in good condition but i should not like to say how much my weight is
