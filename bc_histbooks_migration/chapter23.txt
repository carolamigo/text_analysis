february a few days ago p and i drove to mr l s to see a friend who has got work there mr l is supposed to have the best stables north of toronto they are certainly very nice and it is very easy to feed cattle and horses in them here it takes one man the whole day to feed thirty head while there one man in an hour and a half can do all that is necessary in the morning and the same at night our friend seemed to like his quarters very much he gets 5 a month and his board and in the summer he is to get 10 the other day i had a great time driving a cow down here from north l i think that i mentioned in a letter about the end of september that p and i took a cow there well i had to fetch it back i started at 7 a m and walked six miles to the railway track i caught the train at s which brought me to north l about 9 30 i then went and got the cow at once and started to lead it back home a dis 64 cow driving tance of some twenty miles as it had been kept in the stable and fed very well since september it was exceedingly lively and indeed during the first five hundred yards rolled me over three times in the snow after that however it cooled down and walked along quietly for the first four miles then it got tired and i had to pull it along by the halter it was terribly slow as the snow prevented us from going more than two miles an hour i got very hungry before we o j o got to s the first place where we could stop this we reached at about 2 30 after three quarters of an hour for food and rest both for myself and the cow and its calf for it had a calf we started on again the cow was still tired and the calf rather footsore so it was a slow business about half way there the cow stopped dead and refused to move an inch i was just wondering what on earth i should do when a man came along with three calves which he had brought from s o h the sport here s starting an hour after i did with his help i managed to get them the rest of the way though it was anything but easy work the cow was a very valuable animal a thoroughbred polled angus worth 200 three days ago we had another blizzard which left us another foot of snow to day the thermometer stands at io below zero but there is no wind and the sun is very hot and the sky as blue as in summer last night we went to a political meeting n the two candidates had both called a meeting at the same place and at the same time of course there was a row they both set to work to abuse each other at last the liberal had to go as things were getting a little too hot for him in your last letter you asked more particularly about the sport here we might have got some very decent deer hunting if we had had time two or three fellows from the neighbourhood made a camping out expedition to the mouth of the nottawasage river j 5 66 the sport here not very far from here they had a great time and shot several deer quite a number of wild duck and a few gangs of geese came in october and november but as they were very wild and everybody was out after them it was not easy to get a shot the fish to be obtained in the georgian bay are black bass which are caught with a spoon and give plenty of play white fish the same as pike to judge by appearance and caught in the same way there are also plenty of lake trout occasionally people use flies for these but most of the fish i m sorry to say are taken with nets in the mill streams and rivers there are plenty of chub for these i usually bait with a grass j o hopper and now i wish to tell you something of our plans for going north west in the spring when in toronto we asked the advice both of colonel d and the g they both said it was the best thing we could do flans for going north west 67 calgary in alberta is where we specially thought of going it is just east of the rockies and the climate is very much milder than here we thought of spending two years there and then if it still seemed advisable of going on to british columbia we could then decide which of the three we liked best before settling down for good british columbia the north west or ontario this we must do at once as all free land grants are to cease in 1890 though probably the time will be extended as to getting there we shall try and get a passage with some cattle men taking cattle up there employ several men to look after them and give them free passes over the railway if we cannot manage this we shall of course have to pay our fare which will be 50 by immigrant car we should have to have about 25 in our pockets when we got there altogether we should want about 125 twenty five pounds once there we shall board ourselves if we can that 5 2 68 plans for going north west will be cheaper than boarding out at 12 a month of course the man with whom we get work may give us board and lodging as well as wages but if we board ourselves we can do something in the way of keeping bees poultry and a cow i dare say the cooking would not be good at first but practice will improve that it would require some outlay to start this about 10 but we should more than get this back in six months time we feel that the sooner we learn to do for ourselves the better it will be we can get a shanty for 1 50 cents per month t seems to be learning quite the right kind of things in england horse shoeing oo o he will find most useful i only wish we had had time to learn it in fact we have thought of putting in a few months with a blacksmith ourselves he ought also to learn welding 0 o iron and steel brazing and tempering such things as the tines of a fork carpentering too is very useful what we learnt from more hints to would be immigrants 69 everson as the putting up a cow shed was invaluable he should be able to cobble a little and mend his own clothes bookkeeping is quite indispensable if you mean to run a farm gardening is also a good thing to know our outfit was just about complete some coarse cotton shirts as they keep out the thistles and the barley beards would have been an advantage flannel shirts make you like a pincushion directly a big fur cap round and large enough to cover the ears would also have been an advantage flannel shirts should be of very coarse material good flannel is useless some light strong breeches as well as corduroys are useful for the summer it is well not to have many cloth clothes and a light mackintosh is better than a heavy waterproof the india rubber baths which we did not bring would have been very useful 1
