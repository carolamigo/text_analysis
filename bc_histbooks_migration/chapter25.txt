march the day before yesterday one of the yearling colts got upset into a manger in the stable and not being discovered it remained there for some hours on its back the whole time when we found it it was necessary to chop the manger down with an axe to get it out and then it was utterly unable to move we spent about two hours rubbing its back and legs then we rolled it into a flat kind of sleigh called a stone boat and brought it down to a warmer stable we gave it gruel and linseed tea several times during the even ing and it seemed so much better at ten o clock that we thought there was no need to mm signs of spring 73 sit with it but yesterday its head was awfully swollen and it could not eat in the evening we had to kill the poor beast as inflammation ofthe bowels set in that seldom lasts more than half an hour so it was better to put it out of its pain to day the chinook is blowing and we were able to dress with our window wide open only three days ago the thermometer was down to 20 below zero dick and i have started to teach ourselves book keeping as it would be little use to try to run a farm if we could not keep our books properly we found it pretty stiff at first but now we get on swimmingly we spend about an hour and a half at it every evening
