august we have been harvesting in real earnest following a reaping machine and stacking up the sheaves into groups of ten each consists of two leaning against each other this i did the other day from 6 45 a m till 7 p m ten acres5l about i could not work fast as there was a high wind on at other times we have been unloading waggon loads of sheaves in a barn this is done with hay forks the sheaves have to be tossed sometimes ten feet above your head to somebody who catches them with a fork and then throws them to another fellow who shoves them away i have done most of the unloading here and find it requires good muscles as well as a certain knack yesterday i pitched off loads of sheaves from 6 30 a m till 9 p m allowing intervals for meals the only parts of me at all stiff were my fingers this shows that i am getting pretty well hardened to the work i think the harvesting very jolly and harvesting 25 i am seldom really tired now after a day of it this morning sunday i went down with p b to herd cattle about half past eight we came back at ten minutes to eleven i was rather hungry as i had not had anything to eat since yesterday s tea at 4 30 we have very fine cucumbers here and plenty of them i ate one about thirteen inches long for break fast this morning the weather now is hot enough to roast a potato
