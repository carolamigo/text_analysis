january 1888 we have been having a week of real winter it would not have mattered if we had been ready for it but the shack is not properly plastered there is no hay for the horses as caught by the cold 189 the stacks are a mile and a quarter off and the supply of firewood and food is rather low the spirit in the thermometer has not been within shouting range of zero since monday week excepting on one day and then we all rushed off to the bush ten miles away to get more firewood the snow is so deep now that horses can hardly draw a waggon and sleighs are rare round here yesterday we borrowed a sort of sleigh known as a jumper it is very low and you sit just behind your team s heels well we started in this thing to calgary to get some food when we were three miles on the way we had to stop and get thawed out at a house as the snow thrown up by the horses hoofs had frozen on our faces and made it impossible to see finally we had to turn round and come home then i saddled a horse and rode over to a neighbour s and borrowed enough food to keep us going till we can get some from calgary i forgot to say that just as we got home the 190 caught by the cold pole came out of the jumper and the team went on leaving us sprawling in the snow tell cook that i ve got a new dodge for bread making instead of yeast i think it is the same plan as that used in palestine by the old jews the last time dough was made for bread i took a small piece of it and put it aside to get sour to day in making bread i am using this sour piece of dough instead of yeast for we have none of that left the bread is not made yet but is doing very well so far
