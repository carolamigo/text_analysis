february you must excuse the long interval between this letter and our last as we have been camping out in the bush for seventeen days cutting posts and rails by the way you need be under very little anxiety about the blizzards you hear of in the n w states hurting us we have them much modified only two or three people were frozen to death in alberta this last one when it came on we were two and a half miles from home with belle and vi and a slight sleigh it was awfully sudden and we could not see ten yards in front out in the bush 9s of us and felt nearly suffocated by the wind but belle and vi knew what was wanted when we turned their heads home and all we had to do was to hold on while they really tore home straight across the prairie in what i think must have been a bee line for the shack as we were home in less than no time our thermometer did not go below 22 to 17 f until the wind had subsided when it went down to 300 f we had rather a nice time in the bush as we were really warm there being no wind among the trees we worked all day in our shirt sleeves there were only three cold nights in one of which the thermometer went down to 2 50 f that was our last night there three days before we caught an awfully pretty little brown owl about four inches long and his head larger than all the rest of his body he was splendid at keeping the mice out of the tent he was frozen to death on that last night which was a great 13 2 out in the bush pity as he was very tame and would eat from the hand there were no animals to be seen except birds though we saw lots of wolf trail and heard them howling and yelling all round at night they woke us up one night when they were killing a cow about a quarter of a mile off the noise they made then was tremendous we saw one bear black trail and followed for two miles with our guns but it got so dark we had to give it up next day the trail was covered with snow by the way the wolves in the bush are called timber jacks and are larger and fiercer than the coyote or prairie wolves they all have splendid furs on now i wish i could get some during the last week in the bush snowstorms prevented any supplies reaching us and for the last three days we had beef straight with a little baking powder and treacle to eat with it and the beef would beef j straight means beef and nothing else another team 197 not have held out for more than two more meals you say in your last letter that g recommends hiding from a blizzard in the snow as far as i have seen in this country one could only follow the ostrich s example and hide one s head and leave the rest to luck not much use in a blizzard i think i said we might be getting some more bronchos any time as now is the best time to break them we saw three yesterday and have arranged to get them if the owner will sell at our price 240 48 for the three
