july the day we posted our last letters to you we went to comox in the sloop the wind fell almost directly after we had started so we had to pull the sloop by means of the two sweeps a man at each we pulled here twenty two miles and can feel it now in our left hands which got rather cramped coming 134 a sudden squall back next day the wind again fell in somewhat of the same way we got out the sweeps but after we had been pulling for two hours a regular storm got up suddenly and the sea was running very high indeed in less than ten minutes from the time when it had been like glass we were only just able to beat round the point ahead of us if we had failed to do this i don t know what would have happened once round that we made good time down to the harbour we have been doing a little prospecting lately for minerals but have found nothing except a few small veins not worth troubling about the place is all jumbled up by earthquakes and upheavals and things of that kind so that it is almost impossible to find really large ledges or veins we shall not stay in this island much longer there is not sufficient good land to make it worth our while to start a farm here after all i think we shall go back to our old plan and make our way to calgary of we decide to leave the island 3s course it is rather a disappointment not finding anything here but still it is plain there is nothing and so we must make the best of things part iii alberta
