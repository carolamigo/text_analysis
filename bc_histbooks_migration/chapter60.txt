june we are just finishing railing in our pasture land for the last week dick has stayed all day in the bush cutting and piling rails while i hauled them down to our place we landed four loads a day that is about 200 rails and took about two hours and a half to each load so you can guess that we have had good busy days towards the end of the week belle and vi thought that they had had about enough of it and became rather bad tempered they didn t show it to me but would bite and kick one another this summer we intend to break in a new work and play 215 team mab and dolly enlarge our pasture land to 180 acres and put up about thirty tons of hay for our own use then we want to get a contract for hay at the s creek ranche i went to see the manager and made him an offer he will let me know in a day or two whether he takes it or no i rode over to see him on queenie when we got to the river two dogs began to jump about and bark on the other side so my lady insisted on walking down the river till i was just wet through and madder than anything with her on the whole though she behaves very well considering that she has only just been broken to the saddle everything round here is looking beautiful just now the birds are present in flocks we have had no time for fishing yet though the river is not 500 yards from us our room looks quite jolly now we have put up some bookshelves and the photos also our bats rackets and guns the round 2l6 work and play log walls show the things off very well dick has been trying unsuccessfully to sketch the house lately but he makes it look rather like a pigsty so i won t send any of his attempts just yet
