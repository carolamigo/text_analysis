june 1886 on saturday we left toronto by the mid day train arriving here a few minutes before six the country through which we passed was quite different to that between montreal and quebec there were still large forests but the fields looked more cultivated and we saw lots of large orchards we saw lake sincoe and in the distance barrie this is a splendid place with a sort of rambling old farmhouse a large garden and orchard and lots of vines the fruit has all done blossoming and is forming fast the farm is chiefly arable there are only about fifty head 1 2 4 our new home of cattle and a few horses the birds here are rather peculiar a robin is about as big as a thrush blackbirds and canaries are flying about in plenty there are also plenty of mosquitoes but i have only been bitten once and that hardly itched at all i enclose a mosquito mr and mrs b are very nice people indeed the family consists of two sons and three daughters we could not get our big trunk which the porters at euston christened the woolwich infant into the house for some time at last one of the doors was taken down and then we managed it we began work on monday at six this work was loading manure from the barn yard into waggons which were then drawn out to the fields a waggon being always waiting to be filled this was continued till eight when we went in to breakfast breakfast consisted of fresh meat tea bread and butter and fruit after breakfast we went to the the first week s work 5 potato pits to cut up potatoes for seed the potatoes had to be cut into pieces containing one or two eyes the juice stains the hands very much and we found it almost impossible to wash it off during the day soap only making it worse this work was kept on till twelve when we returned to the house for dinner consisting of roast mutton potatoes beans and pudding after dinner we planted potatoes till six we had to plant each seed potato by itself along a furrow and being kept in a stooping posture the whole time our backs soon began to ache at six we had a tea of bread and butter stewed fruit and tea after tea we went into the garden and worked at getting the tennis lawn into o o order when it became dark we went into the house and played whist till ten o clock when we had a supper of bread and butter and milk and then went to bed the next morning after the usual tumble up boys at our door we started on the 6 the first week s work same work and indeed kept it up just the same every day till friday all the potatoes being then sown on friday morning we followed a plough on some quite new ground our portion of the work being to make the sods stop in the places into which the plough turned them this had to be done with our hands and as the sods were frequently of considerable length and size and very stiff it was no easy job and very exasperating when after a frantic struggle to push a sod three or four feet long out of the furrow you saw it slowly roll back into its former position we had also to help the man at the plough to clear it of roots of which there were plenty altogether one had to be pretty lively to keep up with the plough we left off at eight to go to breakfast after breakfast we did odd jobs such as helping to harness the horses and to fix up fences after dinner we dug weeds in the fields till tea at six after tea we went along a few birds 7 the stream and shot a few birds and came in at dark to play whist on saturday we got up at six and fetched the cows in and then watched them being milked till eight when we had breakfast after breakfast we worked in the garden digging and spreading manure till twelve after dinner we went along the creek with our guns and shot some chipmunks a woodpecker and bee bird getting back about half past four about ten that night there was an alarm that the colts had got on to the railway track we went out with one of the men to try and find them but could not do so as we then heard that there would be no more trains till monday morning we did not trouble any further about half an hour later the boss came home and we helped to put away his horses and rig
