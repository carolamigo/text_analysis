february a short time ago we had a blizzard which lasted for four days it did not blow very cold but the snow drifted tremendously one day the mail train which was due at 12 20 passed at 3 a m the next morning next day mr b and i went up the mountain the roads were in grand condi tion the snow being drifted eight or nine feet deep in some places coming down one steep slope the horses slipped or rather sat down and we all had a sort of toboggan slide for about a hundred and fifty yards fortunately lumbering 7i the snow was deep enough to prevent our getting up any very great speed twice i had to jump out and hold up the cutter to prevent its upsetting soon we expect to go up there to haul lumber to the saw mill lately we have been drawing firewood from the bush it is first sawn into lengths of four feet and then split and piled on the sleigh crossways it is terrifically hard work for the horses as the loaded sleighs have to be drawn over trunks of trees and through the under bush there were also numbers of holes made by the tearing up of trees in the high wind we turned one load clean over and had to put it on again with the other load we did very well till we reached a big hole and then chuck went the front bob of the sleigh into the hole and weight and jerk together broke the centre of one of the side beams the wood was piled on again and then in trying to draw out of the hole the horses drew clean away from the sleigh and 1 lumbering bent the draw bolt which is quite an inch thick we had to chain them to the sleigh after that as we had no means of straightening the bolt but after a bit we got away all 0 o j right though the horse s legs were awfully cut about by their sharp shoes when they plunged into the deep snow
