june where we are now is a little nook in a very pretty bay it is a lovely place but when i say that there is scarcely a yard of level ground you will understand that it has its drawbacks we have as i dare say you know a tent for w and myself another tent on the top of a little hill close by for the boys and a hut which serves for kitchen and parlour sailor john sleeps in the sloop the way we live now 119 the ground our tent is pitched on is very uneven i have to run up a hill to get to the washhand basin and i invariably slide down backwards once if not twice there were rather deep holes where we made our bed but w filled them up with pieces of rock then we put pine boughs then moss after that a canvas blanket cover a buffalo robe and finally blankets it was really very comfortable but lately w has made a really grand bedstead as he thought it better to be further from the ground besides it gives the spiders and beetles more trouble to get at us the hut is a great convenience we have our stove in it with shelves for our stores it has it is true no door and no windows and three fourths of the floor are gone but there is enough left for us w and the boys have now made a table and four good benches and we get on admirably well they as you know are busy exploring the island and i sometimes go with them r 120 the way we live now but exploring is not an easy thing in this country no words indeed will adequately describe the places that have to be got over sometimes there are large masses of rock covering the ground and there are smaller pieces everywhere then there are very thorny rose bushes with small very red sweet smelling flowers by the way and blackberries a very pretty shrub called sal lal ferns fir trees and any quantity of other bushes and trees then the ground is covered at intervals with fallen trees every few yards you have to get over one some you can step over but most require a good climb as for trying to go round them that is out of the question for many of them are over seventy yards long many of the large trees that are thus lying on the ground are quite rotten and have a number of young fir trees some of them quite tall growing all along their trunks sometimes they are useful for helping us to cross swamps i am getting the way we live now 121 quite used to walking along them over hollows that are unpleasantly deep swamps there are in abundance and lovely lakes these latter full of trout the boys have caught a few of these but i look forward to o their getting more when they become more skilful deer are in plenty but it is now the close time for them however we have had a taste of them for two siwashes indians came over the other day in a canoe the siwashes seem to be allowed to kill them at any time and w bought the hindquarters of one for fifty cents and some tobacco it was most delicious meat sometimes i know you will like to know how we fare we have cod from the bay john cooks it cut up in pieces with onions and tomatoes it is eatable in this way but not a very good fish after all i am head cook though john and indeed all help john has some greek ways of dressing things which make them palatable the bread at first 122 the way we live now was a great trial i brought some bottles of yeast from victoria and made a dreadful mess of the first batch perhaps i used too little yeast anyhow the loaves would have done for ballast eventually they were sunk in the harbour and i assure you that they went down like lead at last i made some yeast for myself since then and especially since i have been able to have some of that excellent winnipeg flour i have managed very well we have hot rolls for breakfast imagine that sometimes john makes them sometimes w or the boys then there is a supply of pilot bread or biscuits to fall back on one day last week they killed a coon and when they had skinned it thought that they would like it cooked for dinner i remonstrated faintly but was overruled indeed i could not refuse when they offered to prepare it and prepare it they did and very nicely too so that it looked just like a hare at first they left the eyes in but it the way we live now 123 looked so dreadful that i never could have basted it especially as it had to sit with its head out of the oven door even after the eyes were taken out it had a quite dreadful grin still when it was cooked it really looked very nice and w and the boys seemed to eat it with great appetite as for me i got off with a very small piece but then see the inconsistency of these creatures suddenly when we were eating our pudding w said that coon was a trifle green and one of the boys said i am glad i ate it and yet somehow i wish i hadn t and the other chimed in so they all joined in vilifying the poor beast i was not altogether surprised when i remembered that they had had their noses over it a good part of the afternoon but coon is not an every day luxury for food generally we have fish tinned meats and soups cheese butter syrup cake pie or pudding and of course very admirable bread the last thing at night we m 124 the way we live now generally have some chocolate our great want is green vegetables though the canned are tolerably good milk of course we have none except the condensed as for clothes the place is simple destruction to them cooking and walking through the bush would finish anything w and the boys dress if you can call it dressing anyhow but w always puts on a collar for service on sunday i kept to collars as long as i had any clean now i wear embroidery i have made vain endeavours to starch some collars myself but somehow they won t come stiff but i mean to try again we have some minor plagues the mosquitoes are not much to complain of but the midges in the evening are a great pest not that they make any difference to me but w and the boys complain of them loudly small flies i am glad to say do not trouble us either in the house or out the way we live now 125 of doors other insects are innumerable the ants are simply enormous and there are bright beetles like those that are sometimes 0 worn for ornament there are crowds of mice and i am always patching bags that they have eaten through yet they are so tame that one does not like to be hard upon them there are numbers of butterflies and some very pretty birds some of which have a very nice song but not so nice i think as our larks and blackbirds at home there is one w says that reminds us of home with its note something between a postman s knock and a policeman s rattle the crows of which there seem to be whole flocks are not musical when we first came they used to gather round our tents in the early morning and waken us with their quarrelling the boys thought of throwing boots at them but were afraid they would carry them off besides the crows there are eagles in abundance the boys shot two fine specimens the way we live now the other day when i tell you that there are panthers in the island i shall have about completed my list one of the boys had a little adventure with one of them some short time ago he went down into a swamp to cut a stick for a fishing rod and lo in the bush which he had picked out there was a panther lying he had nothing but his axe with him the panther happily moved off and so when he had got his stick did the boy so no harm came of it but he had a scare so my dear m this is the way we live now
