july as you have been some time without a letter i will give you a description of what we have been doing during the last few days on wednesday the three of us rowed about four miles down the island to find a new camping ground we went to a bay where there is a river running out we hope to find some good land somewhere along the course of this we found an old hut in very fair condition the only drawback was a large hole burnt in the middle of it by the siwashes but this we can board over we 9 130 more exploring came across one or two deserted logging camps and shot a brace of grouse on thursday we rowed to a siwash village where there is a roman catholic mission most of the inhabitants were out fishing or shooting the padre was also away so we started home again we rowed considerably over twenty miles that day and the sun was awfully hot in first crossing the channel we sighted a huge whale it gradually got nearer and nearer to us and then disappeared after a bit it suddenly came up about thirty yards to one side of us making straight in our direction w and i were rowing and you bet we didn t stop to watch we made the boat go pretty quick and the whale passed just by our stern coming home we saw no less than seven whales in different parts of the channel now while i am writing i can hear them blowing on saturday we went to camp by the river which we found on thursday we rigged up a tarpaulin for more exploring j3i k and w and dick and i found a nice little hollow behind a tree under some bushes first we spread a waterproof sheet then folded our coats into pillows and with our guns and knives handy lay down and pulled the blankets and another waterproof sheet over us we were very comfortable indeed as the sal lal bushes on the top of which we were made a sort of spring mattress it was necessary to have our arms ready as we were some five and twenty yards from the camp fire and the whole place was swarming with gray wolves on sunday we took a walk up the river after going some way we came to a splendid fall the river ran through a narrow gorge about thirty feet broad the whole gorge was on a tremendous incline and it was headed by the fall where the water came sheer down some twenty feet we could feel the ground shake quite a quarter of a mile away and a large cloud of mist and spray hung over the falls we then 9 2 j 132 a fine view climbed on to a hill which was near and from there saw the grandest piece of scenery i have come upon since we passed the selkirks the river came from a large lake several miles long and one or two broad all round it were steep hills covered with timber and in the background rose the cascade mountains capped with snow in the evening there was the mosfmagnificent sunset that i have ever seen it was really beyond description i was looking over the smooth sea dotted all round with little islands and lit up with a bright red light behind the sea rose up the mountain range along the coast of vancouver island while behind them again were the snow mountains their white peaks shining with a brilliant flame colour the clouds just above the mountains were edged with the same hue and the whole sky was reddened with the light this lasted about half an hour and then the whole sky changed to a wonderful steel gray which was almost as beautiful though quite a fine view 133 different you could not realize a quarter of its beauty from the best description i only hope you will be able to see something similar soon when you come out here there is lots of fun in camping out here and the scenery is very grand indeed almost too grand and rugged i think for my part i should like to see a little bit of the scenery you get green fields and farmhouses better than all the mountains in british columbia before long however i hope we shall be doing something towards making part of the scenery a little less wild perhaps then the rest will become pleasanter by contrast
