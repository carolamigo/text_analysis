october you ask what knowledge will be of use to you if you join us out here there are plenty of things which you might learn with advantage carpentering and blacksmithing for instance but a little veterinary knowledge would be worth all the rest put together it is of the very greatest importance out here as everybody has something to do with cattle and hardly any have any veterinary knowledge i only wish we had been able to learn something of it before we came out as it is we shall have to read it up now as much as we 44 what ought to be learnt before coming can thatching and gardening are also good o o o o things to know something about dick s fall was not the first and will not be the last i have been thrown off about fifteen or twentv times already indeed i am getting quite used to it now we shall have a lot of driving and riding this winter as there will be several horses to be exercised the life out here is pretty much what we expected perhaps rather more civilized the country has a most quaint appearance after england for instance in pretty nearly every field are large piles of wood stones etc and now and then the tall charred trunk of a tree quite bare of limbs and burnt into the most extraordinary shapes another curious feature in the country is the roads if we may so call them you drive over them in a waggon without springs sitting on a board or anything that comes handy this as you may imagine is the very extreme of all that is annoying and painful bringing in the root crops is perhaps what ought to be learnt before coming 45 the most unpleasant work harvesting though hard enough is rather jolly we shall have some ploughing soon there is a nice piece of rough ground reserved specially for us and it looks very inviting as it has only lately been cleared we don t get much shooting as on a big farm like this there is generally something to do this time i m afraid we shall not be able to get any camping out since the weather has made us late with the root crops they will not be done till the end of this month the mangolds and potatoes are done but there still remain about 12 000 bushels of turnips to be brought in this morning we all drove down to church dick and i in the buggy the others started ahead of us and when we tried to pass kept galloping across the road in front of us tiny got so excited that i could not hold him and he ran away we passed them then sure enough but there was a corner just in front which we went round at full speed i made sure we 46 what ought to be learnt before coming should have been upset as the outside wheels of the buggy were quite two feet from the ground and there is a steep hill the other side of the corner however i managed to stop him but when we got to the bridge we had o o more trouble some people who had been celebrating hallowe en had put a big red waggon on the railing on one side and a large sleigh on the other of course tiny would not pass these at first and when he did he had his front legs in the air most of the time we got down iust in time for church
