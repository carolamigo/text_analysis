june a few days ago we went round the harbour and just outside it in the small boats picking up drift wood for seats tables etc for the camp we got a boat load and arriving home at half past one had lunch and started to make benches we sleep in a hut now above the main camp about sixty or seventy feet higher up to get to this we have to go up a very steep and winding pathway i have seen nobody except our own chase after an eagle party not counting indians for nearly a month yesterday herbert and i went out shooting in the open boat along the shore landing every now and then as we were only rowing about ten yards from land and stalking anything worth shooting after rowing about twenty minutes we spotted an eagle on a tree about a hundred yards in shore so i landed herbert with the rifle to stalk him while i kept the gun in case he came my way after about five minutes of anxious suspense i heard first one then another rifle shot and then a tremendous crashing and saw herbert coming towards me as hard as he could carrying a great dead eagle a splendid bird with a white head and tail huge claws and a beak that would make you pale to look at it turned out that his first shot was successful in killing the bird his second wounded the mate which managed to escape we then continued our journey and saw what we chase after an eagle 113 thought was the wounded eagle settle a little further on i landed with my rifle and made my way towards him but he flew away and settled somewhere ahead so we followed him up and i landed again and saw him perched about seventy feet up on a bare tree about sixty yards from the shore i saw that i could not get up the cliff to the foot of the tree so i fired at him from the beach and saw him drop as i thought i scrambled up the cliff and after ten minutes search found a feather covered with blood but that was all at that moment i heard herbert shout and found that the eagle had contrived to drop into the sea mortally wounded he rowed after it and managed to secure it after some trouble as it was most ferocious and lay on its back in the water with just its head and claws appearing he attacked it with an oar which it promptly laid hold of with all its might and was thus hauled into the boat when i got in it made a savage onslaught on 8 chase after an eagle my legs but the corduroys were a good armour against its claws it turned out to be the one herbert had wounded my shot had gone through its leg and into its stomach thus nearly finishing it off we had some difficulty in killing it as it was still very lively this island positively swarms with eagles ravens and crows at the place where the stream runs into the harbour we found cartloads of dead herrings most likely in consequence of a very high tide lately when they had been driven up the stream as far as the tide went and when that dropped had not dared to go out being left dry or killed by the freshwater the harbour here is always full of herrings sprats etc and there is a great commotion when dog fish come in hundreds leaping out of the water at a time and tremendous scrambles ensuing at the surface every night before we go to bed we have a systematic slaughter of mosquitoes a savoury dish ij5 but they are not nearly so bad here as in ontario i have to use the greatest precision as regards my bed for if i alter my position an inch i am nearly transfixed by a projecting edge of rock if i can avoid this i am very comfortable as i get into a groove lined with moss herbert and i have already made a kind of clothes horse and an easy chair to hold two out of the drift wood
