september it would be very nice if you could send me a drawing of neighbour s new hive from what you say it seems to be handy and would indeed suit this climate very well it is extraordinary how few people keep bees here though they would have splendid honey getting facilities as there are two crops of clover and heaps of wild raspberries and finishing the grain harvest 31 bushes of that kind you will be glad to hear that we have nearly finished getting in the harvest indeed after this week i do not think there will be any more working after six in the evening we shall have i think about three days and that will about end up everything except the root crops and they only take about a week to get in now as to wearing something when barley threshing i find that it is not anything like so bad as represented the last time we threshed barley i had two hours in what is supposed to be the worst place and i found no inconvenience at all i took the place while the man who had it went to get a drink and then found it was not worth while to go back to my old station but anyhow i shall get some goggles they are better than veils which it would be impossible to wear one gets quite hot enough without them there is no danger of our over working ourselves as we generally manage to get into a place 32 finishing tbe grain harvest where nobody can run us i have been only tired out once since i came here i had to do some very heavy pitching i pitched eight loads of wheat sheaves over a beam seven feet high and sixteen feet behind me and further had to keep pace with the man who pitched them off the waggon i managed to hurry the man who took the straw from me i did not feel the least tired about an hour afterwards when i had had a bathe yesterday afternoon i was running a mowing machine rigged up so as to cut peas i rather liked it after stacking sheaves of barley and oats perhaps you would like to know something of our regular expenses here three dollars a month for washing some postage a missionary subscription and one or two other small things so you see we do not need much what we spend the money on is chiefly those things we were not able to bring out or did not know of i think it would be worth finishing the grain harvest 33 while almost to send you the flannel shirts we have not used or get rid of them as it is ruin to them to use them and have them washed here we could get some more suitable ones in their place the parcel post is thirty five cents a pound for anything under five pounds
