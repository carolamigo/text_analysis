august you will be somewhat surprised to see the name at the head of this letter we have been here now about three days and have been looking out for work this i m glad to say we have got it is on a horse ranche five miles from here the pay is 15 each a month and board the arrangement is only for a month but we shall stay on longer if we can agree with the man about wages 15 is very low but as we saw no immediate chance of better we determined to take it the country round here looks very nice as far as we have seen but we cannot of course 140 we move north west judge yet perhaps you would like to hear something of our journey here we took seven days to go from comox to victoria in the sloop the distance is about 140 miles of these we had to pull at least 80 as we had either no winds or head winds the only fair wind we had was in victoria harbour a little too late for use we left victoria on a sunday at 2 a m reaching vancouver at 9 we had a bath and something to eat and then started to come up the fraser river valley the mosquitoes nearly crowded us out of the cars i never saw anything like them all the inhabitants wore nets over their heads we crossed over 1 200 bridges ranging from 5 feet high and a yard or two across to 300 feet high and 300 or 400 yards long in some places the mountains were very smoky though not nearly so bad as represented in reports certainly though there have been very large fires about when at comox we were offered 20 on a ranche 141 a month each and board on separate farms i was for taking it but dick didn t like it and so we came here i hope you like the eagle s wings we are both in excellent health you would be amused to see us riding about on our mexican saddles which are by the way awfully clumsy and uncomfortable they weigh 30 lb and sometimes more the ponies are the scrubbiest looking animals i have ever seen yet they carry you wonderfully well over the roughest ground the saddles have what is called a horse in front on which you sling your lasso and anything else you wish to carry with you the stirrups are large wooden affairs with leather in front to keep bushes from catching your feet our plans must depend on seeing land which we like the money i think we can save as the wages we can get will be from 20 5 to 40 10 a month and board hi 142 on a ranche and we shall have very few expenses it does not seem much to start on but we can get 320 acres of land for 20 5 in fees and for living on it 320 more for 1 per acre to be paid in three years if we still want the land we ought to start soon so as to get land near the town it costs very little to live if you have cows and poultry and one or two small things of your own to help you on and if necessary one could work out part of the time with a team and earn 60 12 a month by the way a first class team and waggon would only cost jo other prices are equally low so we could start a good many small things to be gradually increased living here is of a somewhat simple nature in fact pork damper and tea damper pork and tea and tea damper pork are the varieties in which we indulge occasionally however bread is substituted for damper we get up now at 5 30 dick milks and l about taking up land h3 i look after two thorough bred horses at 6 30 we breakfast and then draw hay off the prairies twice a week one of us rides round the fences to see that they are in good order we hope soon to get on to a farm where cattle require to be herded as that will give us good opportunities for inspecting the land round the country seems to be a very fine one it consists chiefly of great rolling hills with streams winding amongst them the mosquitoes however are simply awful calgary is a very go ahead town and is growing at a tremendous pace
