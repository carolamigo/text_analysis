june we had a tremendous thunderstorm here a few days ago the rain came down in great sheets and in a few minutes the road was turned into a stream six or eight inches deep we managed to get into shelter just before it came on on friday afternoon we went to a garden party nine miles off there were six of us in a democrat a four wheeled vehicle with two seats one behind the other the roads were very bad and one or two hills were so steep that we had to walk up and going down had to hold on to keep the rig from overrunning the horses it took life at the farm 11 three hours to do nine miles we got home again about half past nine a lawn tennis match was to have been played against a neighbouring club but the rain prevented it the strawberries have been on for some time now the other day mr b took a hundred quarts to market i am now learning to milk at first i took half an hour to half milk a single cow every morning dick goes to bring the cows in while i have to water and groom the driving horse and sometimes one or two colts if they have been used and to clean out their stalls before breakfast this morning when i took tiny to the creek and was riding bareback with a rope round his neck he took it into his head to get excited and canter along the road and as i was not able to stop him not having a bridle i simply let him go and held on tight after breakfast this morning we had to go and head some steers and got back about half past one 12 life at the farm i can harness a pair of horses and put them in a rig now almost without a mistake the canaries here fly about in flocks just as sparrows with you and there are some splendid butterflies and humming birds three days ago we began taking in the hay here the work is not at all unpleasant but rather hard we had breakfast at six a m dinner at twelve tea in the field or lawn supper at nine yesterday we went on working till nine so as to be able to have a picnic to morrow up the mountain i was awfully glad to get to bed but was all right this morning i was down at ten just in time for breakfast as i did not have to fetch the cows in at six as usual of course everywhere people have to work late with the hay when there is fear of rain and there is a certain amount of fun in hurrying it in as those in the field try to put on the loads so as to race those who are unloading at the barn this is really very exciting i have life at the farm 13 been at the barn stowing the hay away as it is brought the weather is delightful not too warm with a cool breeze from the lake though a few days ago it was awfully hot 96 in the shade the mosquitoes are gradually disappearing and that is a good thing sundays here are very jolly as there is no work to do except occasionally to herd cattle and that cannot be called work as we sit in a shady place and read and have a dog to look after the beasts
