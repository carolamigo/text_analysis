december we have written to x the news of his kindness in starting us free is the best possible christmas gift you could have sent us you can t think what a lot of anxiety it has taken from us this gives us the sure chance of getting really good land work i86 ho rse b reeding and makes us independent to a great extent of outside work the winter is getting on most satisfactorily to day the temperature was above freezing and there was a clear sky and plenty of sunshine we shall stay in this locality now and take land north of calgary though all the land for some seventy or eighty miles has been taken to the south of calgary very little of that to the north has been touched the reason is the difficulty of crossing the bow river when bringing stock or produce to calgary this winter however a bridge is being built and will be opened in a few weeks then of course there will be a rush for the best land and we being on the spot will get a pull over the rest i guess we shall devote ourselves chiefly to horse breeding at present in time we shall get to selling grain and hay horse breeding how ever strikes us as the thing to pay most both now and in the future garden fruit we shall ho rse breeding have of course but this is rather uncertain owing to the small fall of snow here indeed all kinds of crops here are rather uncertain owing to the summer frosts we are fairly well satisfied with the winter there have been some pretty cold snaps 270 below zero was the worst but mild weather has been decidedly in the preponderance in this country horses are turned out during the winters just like cattle and after the hardest winters have appeared robust and even fat little colts and all horse breeding will not be such a risky business as it may seem we have not had very much experience it is true but ever since we have been out here we have had more or less to do with them again in this climate they are subject to very few diseases we shall also keep a few cows and poultry our work will be something of this sort herding horses morning and evening branding them in the spring and fall putting up hay for the riding and working horses i88 horse breeding during the winter harvesting a crop of oats for our own use putting up fences and stables in addition to this after three years time there would be buying and selling to be done and shipping the animals off to ontario or manitoba which are the chief markets of course we shall have to work pretty hard at first putting up our log hut and some corrals etc but we shall not mind that why doesn t m come out if the idea that he will be of no use prevents him let him forthwith dispel it from his mind we would soon teach him what real work was and make him think himself the hardest worked brute in creation at first of course we would let him off lightly as a greenhorn and a tenderfoot
