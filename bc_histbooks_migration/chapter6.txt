august we have just finished taking the hay in here and for the next month or two we shall be employed getting in the harvest that 2 i8 before the harvest means breakfast at six and work till eight or nine in the evening we began cutting the wheat yesterday with a new machine that cuts the wheat and binds it into sheaves all the hay season i have worked in the barns taking the hay from the waggons and putting it away which is hot and dusty work though i have got used to it by now i feed the calves every morning and evening with pails of milk and most exasperating they are as there are four calves and two pails three of them get to one pail and one to the other the consequence is that the three get their heads jammed in and then jump about wq have several colts here i am learning to ride them bareback sometimes without a bridle and with only a rope round their necks i can manage to stick on now though not very comfortably i have only been chucked off once three nights ago before the harvest l9 we had a tremendous thunderstorm i was wakened about twenty minutes to three by the bedclothes being lifted off me by the wind we sleep with both door and window open there was only just time to get up and shut the window when the rain came down in torrents the lightning was wonderfully bright and incessant once i could read my watch for nearly five minutes consecutively
