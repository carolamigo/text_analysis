june herbert and i went out shooting in 8 a few birds the bush the other day he shot an eye holder a bee bird and a chipmunk and i shot two chipmunks an eyeholder is a bird with a large beak like a woodpecker a red mark on its head and a black one on its breast its wings underneath are a bright orange it is a splendid looking bird when it is properly cured we will send the skin to you the eye bird is small with a black back white breast and a crest of orange red chipmunks are little brown squirrels with dark stripes on their backs yesterday we were sent out to chop down weeds some distance off we bird nested at the same time but we only found some young swallows in the hole of a tree there is a large kingfisher here which we have tried to shoot but we have not succeeded yet as it never settles we manage now to make our cartridges fairly well the tennis court has now been marked out and we are going to challenge the b club near here as soon as we have had some a few birds 9 practice the mosquitoes have become perfectly awful they make for my hands when i am asleep they do not touch my face but sometimes they bite my neck i have about thirty bites on each hand and as many on each of my feet socks are no protection at all they manage to get through even the thickest we get up about six o clock and bathe in the mill pond which is about twelve feet deep in the middle on sundays we have not much to do and come down about eight altogether it is a very jolly life though the work is hard we have however plenty to eat and as much time to ourselves as we want there are plenty of places round about with any quantity of fish but i have not tried yet as the fish in the stream are only very small
