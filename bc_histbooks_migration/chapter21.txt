january 1887 you are right in thinking it cold here on thursday the thermometer was at 150 f all day i wore a cap in the morning but in the afternoon a hood showing only my a little real cold 59 eyes and nose my breath condensed into a lump of ice half as big as my fist on the outside of the hood it was impossible to keep always at work about every ten minutes you had to stop and start jumping up and down and bang your arms round to get warm again even the milk got frozen in carrying it from the stables to the house a distance of about 150 yards ever since thursday night we have had a terrific blizzard blowing the snow is now three feet on the level and runs up to ten or fifteen feet in the drifts yesterday dick f and i were in the pleasure sleigh we got into a drift and broke three out of four traces in the afternoon we started to go to c and took an hour and a half to go a little over a mile then we got into a drift and stuck completely the snow being over the horses backs they were quite unable to move either themselves or the sleigh so we got out it looked most peculiar to see each one as he got out sink 6o a little real cold right down to his arm pits and his great loose ulster spread out on the snow alongside wte trampled the snow down by the horses then lifted the sleigh right round and went back when we arrived at home our faces were caked over with frozen snow leaving only a space for eyes and nose all to day they have been running single o o engines with snow ploughs on the railway track to keep it open no one thought the clergyman would be able to get here this o o morning from d five miles off but he did so arriving at about twelve he had taken over three hours and had to walk in front of his horse and sleigh most of the way of course there was no congregation so he went back
