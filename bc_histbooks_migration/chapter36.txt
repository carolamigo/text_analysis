july we are getting on a great deal better now yesterday we came across some really good land we dug into it and found there were ten feet of very good peat this with the quantities of dead fish which are thrown up would make exceedingly good manure without much difficulty we could get tons of it to the more exploring i2j harbour at low tide and ship it away things look much brighter than they did a few days ago you will be glad to hear that we are both remarkably well the large amount of exercise which we take is making us grow like one o clock especially the sculling and rowing you will guess what it is like when i tell you that the waistcoats which were made much too large for me will not now meet across my chest by some two inches also it is almost out of the question to button the coats the pilot coats are now just a nice fit and are without exception the most comfortable things for wear that we ever came across you just put one on and lie down anywhere with something for a pillow and you feel as if you were in a feather bed for softness and warmth we are both very brown and i think that you would consider us very dangerous looking ruffians if you saw us when we go exploring in the bush long boots corduroys a 128 more exploring check shirt and a felt tennis hat with the brim well pulled down form our costume sometimes we carry a rifle or a hatchet the long knives too add something of the ruffian to our appearance i have not looked in a looking glass for over a month now and what is more have not the slightest wish to do so to day we went out to follow the course of a certain stream and fix the position of some swamps we found about fifteen acres of swamp and bottom land and a biggish lake on the other side of this was a howling wilderness of rock and forest we found another stream running into the lake and followed it after an hour s hard walking we found ourselves within five minutes walk of the place from which we had started the stream had wound about in the most extraordinary fashion once we saw a splendid buck within easy range it stood still and looked at us but alas we had not the rifle more exploring 129 we also found that the beavers had been mending and raising an old dam within the last twenty four hours there were lots of footmarks so there must be some about still the siwashes however have killed most of them in a day or two we go further down the island here we hope to find larger stretches of good land
