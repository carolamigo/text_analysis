february the day before yesterday i rode over to s creek i was to join another fellow there and together we were going to ride up the creek and spy out the land he never turned up so i slept at a shack there and came back next morning i saw one section of land which i thought would have suited us but it was not possible to examine it properly as the weather was so 198 another team bad i suppose you have heard by this time that we have bought three new mares wild bronchos they are getting quite gentle now though two of them are still very nervous one three year old especially the other day we hitched one into the waggon with vi she ran quite a bit and dick says that he had for about ten minutes the roughest ride he has ever experienced we also got a little cayeuse or indian pony to do our rough riding till the others are better able to stand it it was on him that i rode over to s creek when i started i left dick laughing at me he said i was quite as big as the pony and ought to take my turn at carrying we are having glorious weather now the snow is nearly all gone it freezes about 200 at night but thaws during the day in fact the winter seems to have quite broken up last night however there was a snowstorm and the temperature stood at driving downhill 199 20 the roads as you may imagine are in a pretty bad condition in driving to calgary to day i came across a cutting where there was about six feet of water and slush consequently i had to go down a place which was something very like perpendicular i give a small plan of the incline which is no exaggeration at all belle and vi had to stiffen all four legs and slide for about twelve feet to get down without upsetting i had to brace my feet against the front pf the box and lean back with all my might holding on to the reins in order to keep them up happily the snow was pretty deep so it was not so slippery as it might have been 200 we take up land
