march this morning dick and i had half an hour s skating but the ice was very poor it is the first we have had this winter sleighing is nearly gone now as the roads in some cattle driving again places are quite bare yesterday i drove a load of lumber to c we made a road for the occasion through fields covered with ice and over ploughed fields as well which were often bar it is ticklish work to avoid the stumps and stones when driving over bare places two days ago i started to walk up the mountain to meet some cattle about seven miles from here if they did not come i was to go on and bring them back next day they turned up all right and then came the business of driving them home they were completely tired out as they had already come some eight miles added to this the roads were in a frightful state two feet of soft snow in most places and where that had gone a foot of mud i had a very lively time the cattle tried to take every new road that we came to and made a rush for every gate however by dint of a long stick and incessant yelling i got them into a very obedient storing ice 75 state the boss has j ust sacked the man who did all the cattle feeding and milking or rather the man has just sacked the boss so the milking has again devolved on me to morrow we begin drawing ice from the o o lake it is cut into blocks about two feet cube and then about a ton and a half is put on to a sleigh we pack it all in an ice house fill up the cracks with small slips and then pour water to freeze it all solid after this we cover with eighteen inches of sawdust the ice will keep about fourteen months perhaps more dick and i are proceeding like a house on fire with the book keeping we can now do simple keeping and can balance and close the ledger do you know i have quite a reputation here as a doctor twice i have been asked to look at children as you are something of a doctor one had the measles and the other inflammation of the lungs you would be astonished at the sudden 76 reasons for moving north west changes of temperature which we have here the climate is very changeable much more so than in the north west so far as i can learn here are some temperatures taken at 7 a m february 21st 22nd 23rd 24th 25th 26th 27th 28th 8 mai 20 8 28 o 230 20 o 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 12 34 16 6 18 2 2 34 200
