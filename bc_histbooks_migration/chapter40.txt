september the son of our host here has told us of two good spots about forty miles from calgary that is about a day and a half s journey by waggon they are valleys bordering on streams with plenty of timber at hand there is plenty of natural hay and a considerable amount of game during the winter there is rather 144 about taking up land more snow than in calgary which is a decided advantage this place i speak now of the best of the two is within easy reach of the projected railway from calgary to edmonton which is to be commenced next year to get a place nearer calgary besides being hard to do would not be any greater advantage over a place forty miles off as under that distance no good amount of timber can be found if possible we want to secure some land in the district i have spoken of and to do this we must be quick as considerable tracts of land are being taken up every year we have just seen in a paper that a large party of ontario farmers had started west from winnipeg to spy out the land if we cannot get this place we shall have to go more than forty five miles from calgary which means another day s journey and this would make a great difference now if we could borrow 200 we should next spring buy a team and waggon and go about taking up land 145 for a week up country to fix on a location if we found one that satisfied us we should come back send in our claim to the land office work out for six months and in the succeeding fall enter into possession finally i think by that time we shall have had sufficient experience to start for ourselves as we shall have been out here for two and a half years by next fall we shall have about 100 of our own to add to the 200 which we should borrow this would give us a great advan o o tage in starting as it will enable us to get things that will bring in a return the next year we expect to be able to pay back the whole interest and capital in three years i think i have given all our plans and thoughts on this subject tell f that all round calgary and the north west generally there is splendid pike fishing where we are now we often change our salt pork for jack steaks and very good they are we catch them with a spoon bait from 10 146 about taking up land a canoe and they give very fine sport the general size is from 4 to 12 lb i forgot to say that though we should buy our provisions for the first six or nine months yet we should doubtless be able to supply ourselves with fresh meat by means of our guns and rods t had better not come to us before we have been settled six months as during that time we shall be roughing it a bit and it would not do for him to do too much at first tell him to try and if possible learn how to thatch both houses and haystacks to day dick and i have just returned from calgary dick rode down looking a regular cow boy on a small white cayeuse or indian pony with a huge mexican saddle and stirrups with huge leather flaps to them he wore his old gray coat and a large gray felt sombrero on his head altogether he looked an awful ruffian i drove down with mr g the owner of about taking up land 147 this ranche as i am unable to walk owing to an accidental stab which i gave myself with my large knife i was trying a dodge for opening it with one hand and it half opened without my knowing it and so i ran it about two inches into my right thigh i was quite lame yesterday but can get around all right to day the tourniquet braces came in very useful for bandaging as we had not our regular medicine chest with us we went into town chiefly to make use of a note of introduction to a mr m he was very kind indeed and has taken all our luggage into his strong room till we get fixed for ourselves we told him exactly how we stood and he promised to write to a friend of his and get us places for the winter with a company which is working up at reddeer river he also said that we ought to start for ourselves at once if possible and said we could do so very well indeed with 200 to 300 he very much approved of our ideas as to how and 10 2 y 148 about taking up land with what stock we should start he was also very much taken with the notion of bee keeping very little is done here in that way and so we could command almost any price we wished for honey fowls also he thought well of and said they alone could feed us eggs fetch 30 cents a dozen he also said that when we had land fenced in we ought to keep sheep he told us there would be difficulties and losses to contend with but that if we made up our minds to succeed we were bound to do it further he gave us a note to the land commissioner or agent asking him to help us in the choice of land and said that when we fixed on any section of country we might come to him and he would show us the reports of the government surveyors on that particular part then we ought to go on a few days trip to see the land and if we liked it take it up if you object to the idea of borrowing we can wait till we have saved enough to start but the about taking up land 149 result would be to place us further from calgary and we might not get such good land by the way you will find i think somewhere in my diary which i sent off to day an estimate we made when we first thought of the plan the prices named for horses and cattle are high but i think it best to get first rate stock at a high price and not second rate beasts the first always command a certain value and with the second you can never be sure of getting more than half what you paid for them our first object mr m said is to get land with good hay on it good timber near or on it and with good water this kind of land is getting harder to obtain every year so you see we ought to hurry we left british columbia firstly because the climate is so hideously wet in winter and spring and secondly because what land is not already taken up costs from 5 to 30 per acre to render it fit for cultivation this 150 wild duck shooting climate as far as we can judge is much superior a few days ago we went out duck shooting in the slough there is about two feet of water standing in it and any amount of mud so we put on old clothes and had a fairly good time the duck were very wild so we only managed to get five brace during the afternoon our guns have turned out very good ones and are the admiration of all that see them we could if we liked get 2 more than we gave for them for people are always offering to buy them but we shall stick to them as good guns are not always easy to get out here
