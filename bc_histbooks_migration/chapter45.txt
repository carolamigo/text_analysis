october 30th we had a great fight with a prairie fire i had driven into calgary the day before on sunday morning i saw the fire an made out that it was about seventeen miles off and not far from home i started at once and driving back as fast as i could got here at 12 30 dick and h were just setting off we changed horses had something to eat and started the fire was then about a mile away and we reached the place at 1 15 about twenty men were already i 72 a fight with a prairie fire there we set to work beating with wet sacks and kept this up till io p m when a waggon came along with a supply of food and a raw hide the food was very welcome we had had nothing you will remember since mid day the hide was hitched with long ropes to two saddle horses and started one horse on each side of the line of fire the ropes being about twenty yards long so that the animals were out of the reach of the flames we had put a sack of earth on the hide to weigh it down and there were long ropes at the side with men holding them this was to guide it the rest of the fellows at work went behind with their sacks to put out any spots of fire left by the hide dick and i were among these and very fast we had to run most of the time for the horses were terribly scared by the flames and went at a great pace we had to keep up with them as well as we could for a spot of fire if left for a minute would a fight with a prairie fire 173 have spread and spoilt all the work of the hide this we kept up till 4 30 a m with not more than five minutes rest now and then when we had to stop and wet the hide altogether we went rather over thirty miles going round the fire and leaving off about five miles from home by that time every one was dead beat the horses as much as the men there were two teams and thirteen saddle horses at work and those that had dragged the hide in one little coulee or valley where the flames were ten or twelve feet high were singed all over when we got across after the hottest three minutes i ever had or wish to have every one s clothes were on fire dick had four large holes burnt in his breeches and one side of my shirt was burnt off the fire destroyed a few stacks but did no serious damage what would have happened had it been left no one can tell such a job i hope never to see again in the little coulee i spoke of it was 174 a fight with a prairie fire like a furnace every now and then the wind would come in a gust and then the fire would travel faster than a horse could go we got it out just in time for when we had just finished the wind began to blow very strongly and a small piece which we had not put out got up steam and rushed away east at a fearful pace it reached bow river which was six miles off in less than twenty minutes and burnt a streak as clear as if a road had been made there was another fire burning on the other side of the bow river this was not put out till a slight fall of snow came and finally settled it yesterday i drove into calgary in a go cart a sort of diminutive dog cart the horse a broncho had never been driven single before so i expected rather a lively time especially as the cart was a borrowed one and i had been warned not to drive fast over rough places for fear of its coming to the team turns out well 75 grief directly the broncho s head was loosed off he went as hard as he could tear over the rough prairie i thought something would break every moment but wonderful to say it held together we are very much pleased with our team they are real good pullers the other day we went to fetch logs from the bush we got four long green logs awfully heavy they are quite twenty four feet long also we had a shorter one measuring about eighteen feet as the waggon was coupled too short the weight was wholly thrown on the hind wheels over which the logs were just balancing well after we left the bush we came to a swamp and of course the hind wheels sank in up to the hubs and the waggon stopped we rested the mares about two minutes and then set off again they pulled till i thought the harness would go and the waggon slowly moved out of the swamp this was pretty good considering that they had brought the 176 the team turns out well load about nine miles already last night we had rather a misfortune something got into the stable and scared the horses so much that one of the mares slipped her colt it is a great pity as next spring it would have been worth 30 or 40 dick you will be pleased to hear is bread maker for the establishment at this very moment he is making the dough up into loaves for baking we are both first rate cooks now and can get up an awfully good feed out of bacon beans and flour with a little grease you would not know what was in the stuff and would only think how good it was by the way judging from your last letter you seem to have rather an exaggerated idea of the winter here seven months long you call it i think we are now in the middle of november and don t expect winter till after christmas though of course it may come any day but if it came at once it could not last the winter here 177 longer than four months probably it will only last for two ploughing always begins here in march when the frost is well out of the ground we do of course have cold snaps here and when it is cold it is cold and no mistake
