april you will see by the heading of my letter that we have changed camps we are now living with a fellow whose land adjoins our own and are working tremendously hard hauling logs to build our house and preparing it for habitation 205 rails to fence with the house of course will take some time after we have done that we shall turn to the fencing we shall want about a mile and a half of that as soon as the frost goes we shall break thirty acres as we want to get a crop next spring we shall have a few potatoes and vegetables in this spring a man who lives near here told me the other day that once when he was fishing in the creek he pulled out about eighty pounds of trout this may be a little tall but still it shows that the stream is a pretty good one he said also that none of the fish weighed under a pound last sunday i had a small adventure with a horse in the pasture here i was trying to catch him well i got the lasso round his neck but he got a start on me and as the ground was very slippery and i was on foot i could not stop him so he pulled me over i thought that if i hung on to the rope a bit 206 preparing it for habitation perhaps he would stop but i guess he didn t the further he went the faster he went and after doing ten miles an hour over hard rough frozen ground for the distance of some two hundred yards i decided to let go i got rather bumped and am stiff now from it dick then went to the stable to saddle bull the stallion and run the horse in he had broken out of the pasture and when he arrived at the stable a quarter of a mile from the hut there was our friend standing with belle and vi you talk about the difficulty of getting a good house in england now here we have to be thankful if we can t crawl in and out through the walls in our last residence we could see through them on all sides however we have determined that ours shall be a model house i hope the determination will last
