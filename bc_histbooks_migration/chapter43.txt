october i am sorry not to have written to 158 we buy a team you before but somehow a wandering sort of life does not seem conducive to keeping up a correspondence next year if we have a place of our own you may expect more letters i hope you and a will come out and see us as soon as you can i can promise you lots of sport wild duck prairie chicken snipe deer bear black grisly and cinnamon wolves gray timber and prairie also trout and pike fishing if we take up land on little reddeer river all on the estate except the grislies and cinnamon and they will be within a few miles and with them mountain lions a kind of puma we are feasting now every day on duck chicken or snipe which we can shoot sometimes without going ten yards from the house the snipe are the best eating we have had for a very long time i have just been trying a dodge for washing flannel things with ammonia i think it will answer the trial i gave it was very breaking them in hard as the things were exceptionally dirty this winter in all probability we shall stay where we are now except when we get work at any distance off if we are not able to get work for the winter for wages we shall stay here working with our team for board and lodging and that of the team also the work will consist of hauling logs to build stations from the bush to here and also in hauling hay to calgary for sale at present we are engaged in breaking in our team we get an occasional job for a few days helping with the harvesting etc we were very grateful for the draft we received it or rather the bank did the day after we cabled and owing to its coming so quickly we were enabled to buy a splendid team of bay mares before they were shipped with a lot of other horses to ontario we have also bought a waggon and a set of double harness with the money we saved this v i6o breaking them in summer by our work so we shall in future have a team and waggon and we shall have a four times better chance of getting work this winter than we have had before we gave 40 for the team it consists of two bay mares one dark and the other light one is three years old and the other four they do not stand very high but they are what is called low heavies that is with short legs and heavy bodies very clean cut and neat and not by any means what would be called bulky they will in another year s time or so when they are full grown be very strong everybody who has seen them has admired them and when they are thoroughly broken in they will be worth from 50 to 60 we are going to call them belle and vi it was rather a big business breaking them in as they were awfully wild three days ago we started on the work and this is what we did first of all we separated a small breaking them in 161 bunch of horses from the main herd which was running free on the ranche this bu nch we drove into a corral or enclosure we then drove out one by one all the horses except the two we wanted then we fastened up the corral and began work we first proceeded to lasso one of them when this was done the three of us held on to the other end and pulled with all our strength the horse in the meantime rushing madly about the corral rearing and jumping striking with its front feet and lashing out behind after about ten minutes a difference became apparent it had been lassoed with a slip noose so it began to gasp and roar and as the noose became tighter round its wind pipe to stagger and reel and finally fell over its tongue hanging at full length from its mouth perfectly black and dripping with blood it however regained its feet again by a terrific struggle but only to fall a second time then two of us sat on its head and another ii 162 breaking them in tied its four feet together we then put a strong rope halter on and took the noose from off its neck after a few minutes it began to revive and tried to get on its feet the end of the halter was next tied to the horn of the saddle its feet were untied and one of us pulled it round the corral by main force after a while we were able to hold the halter by hand and slowly approach it tickle its ears and pat its neck all this was done with the greatest caution as the least quick movement would have terrified it after a rest one of us would hold the halter while another went at a respectful distance and drove the horse with a whip every time it flung itself about a jerk of the halter would tend to convince it that it was no longer its own master when a few hours of this sort of thing had passed it became comparatively tame though when first tied up to the wall of a stable it breaking them in 163 flung itself against the wall till huge bruises were raised over its eyes and on any prominent parts of its head we drove them about eight miles and put them into another corral for the night and 0 gave them hay the next morning we had to throw it again repeating the choking process in order to replace a broken rope on its halter for about three hours we led it with a halter one going behind as before till it would allow itself to be led without anyone driving it the other horse was treated exactly in the same way and both are now fairly submissive yesterday we put the harness on them for the first time as all we had done so far was merely halter breaking a very small fragment of our labours we started off to fetch them after breakfast when we got there we led them round a bit and took them to water and then started home each leading a horse about half way home we changed our mode of progression 11 2 w 164 breaking them in i and i went ahead holding a rope with each hand herbert going behind and driving them after about ten minutes they took it into their heads to get frightened and both bolted off at full speed i hung on for about forty yards and then had to let go as i had absolutely no check on them only holding each with one hand the rope pulling through my hand blistered and rubbed the skin off all my fingers after about fifteen minutes we cor nered them up against a fence and managed to get hold of the long ropes attached to their halters and then resumed our way home arriving in about half an hour we then tied them up to posts at first they pulled back and flung themselves about a bit but soon got used to it we next slowly put the harness on during which they stood unusually quiet after leading them round separate with the harness on we tried to hitch them together and then we had a great commotion they twisted all about and finally one threw itself breaking them in 165 breaking its bridle to pieces i sat on its head while herbert separated it from the other then a fellow we knew arrived with a horse he had just bought and which had been worked before so we hitched them together not till after a tremendous struggle as his horse although it had been worked was much wilder than ours however after a regular fight during which it struck out with its fore feet at a tremendous rate giving me two whacks one on the leg and another on the ribs but doing no damage we hitched them to an empty waggon and drove around they both went fairly quietly one of us holding the reins and another holding the halter rope in the afternoon our mail was brought to us from calgary i don t think there is any chance of our going back to british columbia as we are very much pleased with calgary to be sure butter is 35 cents a pound but for us that will be a greater advantage than draw 166 breaking them in back for the last month we have had beautiful harvest weather not a drop of rain we live regally sometimes having snipe or teal or cold duck for breakfast roast duck or grouse for dinner and sundry wonderful puddings of our own manufacture we have now a regular supply of wild duck as we shot five brace two days ago they are in the cellar hanging we each consume half a duck at a meal sometimes a whole one this morning we fetched a load of hay from the stacks the colt going very well after fetching the hay we let the horses feed for half an hour and then put the other colt in the waggon for the first time she ran at full gallop for about two hundred yards and then quieted down and we fetched a load of fence rails and posts herbert and g then drove to a place two miles off to see some logs etc and i stayed behind and put up a small corral to put hay in so as to keep stray animals from eating it after two hours they breaking them in 167 came back the colt quite tamed down tomorrow we shall drive the two new colts into calgary when i shall post this letter
