may manage to shoot a chicken or two but they are getting awfully wild now and very hard to kill owing to their enormously thick plumage the chinook that i spoke of has brought splendidly fine weather while i am writing 184 christmas though it is freezing hard outside as the wind has shifted into a more northerly quarter two days ago we saddled belle and vi for the first time belle bucked a little over a waggon standing near but was soon quiet again vi however put her feet head and tail together in real earnest but she slipped and rolled over frightening herself so much that she became quite subdued we do not intend to use them as saddle horses at all but think it as well that they should be broken to it in case it might be necessary m has just told me of a good place ten or twelve miles out of calgary and we are going out to see it the first chance we get if it is as good as m says we ought to make quite as much as 500 a year out of putting up hay and selling it during the winter in calgary what we have to find out is if there is good water in the place and timber near at hand we shall have no difficulty in borrowing as it would be as safe an invest a christmas gift 185 ment as any out here however if there is any difficulty at all about it i guess we can make a start without it next year if we rustle hard enough what is in favour of borrowing though is that if a man starts with a little capital in this country he can go ahead three times as fast as one who has to rustle his start through the extreme kindness of a relative the sum of 200 was presented to the two boys in order to assist them in starting for themselves the news reached them on christmas eve
