may we have been hard at it all this preparing it for habitation 207 month hauling logs and lumber for the house three or four days ago we had just started home with a load from the bush where we had been at work when we got into a morass the wheels of the waggon sank in as far as the axles i had just time to get one of the horses on to firm ground but belle sank till she looked as if she were lying on the ground 0 0 we unharnessed her got her out and started again having thrown off half the load we hadn t gone half a dozen yards when she got in again deeper than ever she pulled till she was so embedded that she could only move her head we were pretty near two hours before we managed to get her out she did exactly what we told her in the way of lying still and jumping or rather trying to jump at one time i thought we should have had to pull her out with the logging chain and the other horse we did not get home that night and had to put up at a friend s house ten miles off 208 we all try to get drowned when there is not a heavy load on the waggons we ride on the coupling between front and hind wheels of course when we cross s creek the water comes over this and as there is no higher place to go to we have to grin and bear it the water is snow water from the mountains and as you ll guess not remarkable for its warmth yesterday we went to calgary when about seventeen miles off we saw a rainstorm coming down from the mountains so we raced it belle and vi did the distance without a stop and hardly seemed at all tired we arrived ten minutes before the storm we got back from calgary to day all safe in spite of mud holes and swollen creeks but we nearly all came to grief at f creek owing to false information two men whom we met told us that it was not too deep to cross with a load when we got to the bank it looked to me too deep but as they had just crossed we determined to go we all try to get drowned 209 by what they said we hadn t gone three yards when i saw what was up still it was no use turning back then a few yards more and the horses were out of their depth and the stream began to take horses wao gon and all along with it belle and vi however did not see the fun of this and did their best to struggle across fortunately they got foothold on some shingle we then waited till the stream slewed the waggon round on od to the same bed and then unhitched them and got them to the other side the next business was to unload the waggon as quick as we could for the water was rising fast we did all we had time for and then hitched the two mares on to the end of the waggon pole they pulled it out and about nine hundredweight of lumber with it had this happened fifteen feet lower down there would have been little chance of saving either waggon or horses as the banks are four or five feet high and perpendicular and there is a good 14 zio we all try to get drowned fifteen feet of water the waggon too was pretty heavy having got thirty three hundredweight on board by the way you asked for a description of dick he is a little taller than when we came out and very much broader his face is the colour of a mahogany sideboard l and i think if he were to appear in b in his usual costume there would be a general stampede out of the town p s mab has got a little colt which does nothing else but run races all day with its own shadow
