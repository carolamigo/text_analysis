april 26th rose at 7 a m had breakfast and finished packing after dinner we carried our baggage to the station came back and said good bye to the b s and then caught the train at 3 35 to b we arrived here about 6 p m and went to the house of a fellow we knew at 12 p m we caught the train for north bay which landed us there at 8 next morning we slept all twm our journey to victoria 93 night on seats without any cushions which were slightly uncomfortable wednesday the train which was to meet us was seven hours late owing to having a very heavy load of cars so we went off to the pacific hotel and had a very good breakfast for 20 cents each i don t think they got much change out of us then we strolled about the place and inspected the engine works which are very extensive after some dinner we stayed in the reading room till 3 30 and then went down to the station we got on a car which was going with our train but it was an hour before the train itself came in when it did come it shunted about till 6 30 at last we made a start for the west at first there was some very rocky country and we passed through two small tunnels the first i have seen in canada when we came to the first of these there was an awful uproar among the colonials probably they had 94 our journey to victoria never seen such a thing before during the night we managed to get to sleep but woke up at odd times thinking it was breakfast time three times at ii i and 3 did i wake up with this hope only to find that it was a horrid delusion thursday we woke finally at 4 o clock and spent the time till breakfast in looking out of the window the country now abounds with small lakes not less than one every mile of the track they were absolutely covered with wild fowl after breakfast alternately dozed and looked at the scenery which has become very rugged in the evening we arrived at port arthur there was just time to buy a loaf of bread when we started again friday at 7 next morning we arrived at rat portage we got out here and were driven in a large dray at full gallop to the queen s hotel here we had breakfast the country has now become rather flatter and is our journey to victoria 95 more or less heavily wooded near winnipeg itself it is almost absolutely level and void of trees at last we found ourselves upon the boundless prairies at 2 o clock we reached winnipeg here we found an immense crowd at the station we got out and rushed about to find the train for the west we were only just in time to get seats though the train did not start for another hour or more it was awfully crowded and for the first few stations many had to stand the country was if possible more level than before studded every now andi then with farmhouses one of these about thirty miles from winnipeg was on fire saturday we reached brandon about 7 in the evening here the thermometer stood at 70 in the shade the prairie here is rolling and hilly there are plenty of streams and pools which are covered with wild fowl brandon is a very nice place and is supposed our journey to victoria to be the most prosperous town in manitoba the prairies which have been a brown colour till now have begun to get greener there has been a scarcity of rain in these parts for a year or two all the prairie about here is strewed with buffalo bones many carloads of which are shipped to the sugar refineries during the morning we saw some deer and later a caravan of waggons going over the plain the plain is lined with old buffalo trails leading to the deepest pools which have water in summer there is still a little snow to be seen among the recesses of the hills our travelling is at an average rate of thirty miles an hour in the train dining car you can get a pretty good dinner for 75 cents soup salmon lamb four kinds of vegetables including green peas apple tart and dessert the country through which we have passed during the latter part of to day is covered with about an inch of snow the reason is our journey to victoria 97 that we have run into a snowstorm as we approached medicine hat the country became a good deal more varied and interesting in parts it was quite hilly at medicine hat some indians came and tried to sell polished buffalo horns whether they were real or not i can t say probably there were some of both after this the country again became absolutely flat and desolate apparently no settlements at all once we had to stop some time to allow a herd of cattle to get off the track about midnight we reached calgary naturally we could not see much of it directly we stopped crowds of people swarmed on to the cars to see who was there i got on to the platform for a moment and immediately a crowd of people poked their faces close to mine and inspected me so i got back again we started again in about twenty minutes sunday this morning we found ourselves 7 our journey to victoria entering the rockies as we go on the scenery becomes splendid on each side of us are great peaks covered with snow and with great masses of pine trees everywhere the snow is about three inches deep and the weather is rather cold the railway lies between two great ranges of hills thickly covered with pine forests the sun is just now rising and the snow topped mountain peaks standing out against the deep blue background of the sky look splendid as the light is thrown upon them occasionally we pass houses which are inhabited by men who have to look after the track we breakfasted at field about 1 30 after another halt we passed over a wooden bridge two hundred feet high we stopped once because of landslips which had to be shovelled out of the track the melting snow on the mountains makes the land very unstable when we went uphill we had an engine behind to help shove we passed two or three more bridges about two our journey to victoria 99 hundred and fifty feet high and then the highest on the c p r three hundred feet high it seemed awfully steep when we looked out of window as there is no railing at the side the line is now running along the edge of the cliff on one side there is the sheer rock and on the other a ravine about half a mile deep and two miles broad there is a river winding along the bottom of it and the banks are covered with pines the mountains here are about 10 000 feet above the sea level and 4 000 above the level of the plain we have just now been passing under huge sheds made to prevent the slidings of mountain snow carrying away the track these sheds cover in the track altogether the line here takes a most circuitous wind along by the foot of some tremendous peaks about every five hundred yards we cross a bridge over some awful precipice monday we woke at 5 a m and still found ourselves among the mountains but 7 2 our journey to victoria they are not quite so high now and then there are some clear spots and occasional chinese settlements we reached new westminster at 2 30 and caught the victoria steamer i was fortunately not ill we reached victoria at 9 30 the place swarms with chinese with enormous pig tails i can t write any more now to morrow we start early for texada being a party of five aunt k and uncle w herbert myself and a greek sailor texada island
