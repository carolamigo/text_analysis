may having finished chinking and plastering we are at last installed in our new house and are very comfortable it is twenty four feet by twenty inside which is considered big in this country and indeed it seems so to us after having lived for some time in a house twelve by fourteen there is a sod roof on and we are going to put lumber over it though as yet the rain has not come through there are two windows and we shall make another as soon as we have time our cellar is six feet square there is a timber partition up the middle of the house in one half we have the stove and cook in the other we sleep 14 2 212 our house sit read etc there is going to be a veranda in front when we have time we have ploughed a fire break round the place and a corral to one side of it to keep the colts in while we are breaking in their mothers there is also a snubbing post close to the house that is a post fixed into the ground very tight used for tying wild horses to while putting on the saddle or harness during the breaking in our water comes from a hole we dug in the coulee a few yards in front of the house in the room we sleep in there is a table in one corner a double bed in the one next to it in the third corner the big trunk known generally as the woolwich infant and in the last a lot of sacks of oats for the horses we sit at present on our two gun cases placed across two kegs of nails in the kitchen there is a stove at one end with the cooking things hung up behind it a pile of oats heaped up in one corner saddles harness and bridles in the other work and play 213 we have broken in queenie to the saddle when we first put the saddle on her she bucked tremendously but quieted down afterwards the next day she bucked even worse than before and when i got on her the first thing i knew was that i had lost my stirrups which were much too long for me and i 0 slipped on one side one leg over the saddle and one under her body it was awfully hard work to hang on while she bucked i clung 0 0 with one hand to a strap round the horn of the saddle and i guess it skinned my knuckles just a bit until to day she used often to run away with us going round in a circle so small that it seemed possible to touch the centre of it we did not buy the canadian pacific railway land after all they asked too much and we found water on our own place there is a clump of timber on one corner of our section and we can get all we want beyond within a few miles by paying 50 for a 214 work and play timber permit timber land costs 5 an acre besides the surveying fees our house faces south west and we get a glorious view of the rockies which we can see through the window when lying in bed we are trying now to get a contract for putting up hay for some of the people round here i think we shall manage it
