june at last we are seeing something of the backwoods as we have come to an island the population of which without ourselves consists of exactly four the country is extremely mountainous with occasional swamps of a few acres in extent and it is in the hope of finding a good sized piece of this that we are staying here at present we have only come across several small pieces and two or three small lakes which might be drained there are very good markets for produce not far off which would make dairying and fruitgrowing poultry keeping etc prosperous the island 107 work in the harbour there are heaps of fish and in the autumn there must be good hunt ing as the place is alive with deer there are also plenty of eagles i know of eight nests within a mile radius ravens crows water fowl and any number of hummingbirds herbert and i sleep together in the old log hut our bed consists of a big tarpaulin on the boards then two grass mats then a buffalo skin fur upwards lastly ourselves and three blankets our coats being the pillows we get up at 5 30 light a fire get breakfast ready and eat it then go for an exploration getting back at 1 after lunch we explore again and get supper ready about 5 30 after supper we read or go for a walk bed about 9 30 or 10 i am afraid my writing is not very good but i cannot do any better as i am leaning on one elbow and writing with the same arm we have no chairs or tables by the bye v io8 we go exploring if you wish to improve your writing you must do it soon for you are not likely to do it out here the weather now is beautiful hardly any rain as that nearly all comes in the autumn or winter the last two or three days we have been exploring pretty hard yesterday we went to a lake taking our fishing tackle and on reaching it i started to fish while herbert and w went round the lake after a quarter of an hour i had a bite and landed a lake trout weighing half a pound i was using paste then afterwards i tried artificial flies and though the fish rose splendidly i did not catch any not being an adept in the art these lake trout are very game fish and are splendid eating having beautiful pink flesh to day we went on another exploration taking our lunch with us after walking for two hours we arrived at a lake and went round it lunching on the further side i we go exploring 109 fished during the time having cut a splendid rod with my axe and using this time cheese paste there being too many trees for flies i used the cork of a bottle for a float and soon had a fine bite after playing a bit as much as i was able without a winch i landed a beautiful trout weighing three quarters of a pound we did not stay much longer so this was the only one i caught these lakes have small greenish mud turtles in them and a good many duck to day we saw two or three broods in the reeds after lunch we pushed on hard going up some awful hills of pure rock covered with thick moss after climbing nearly straight up for about four hours more we reached about the middle of the island where we could see the sea on both sides of us we then turned back taking a direct course to home as near as we could with the help of a compass which we have to use always on exploration here we went fairly straight striking our harbour about a we go exploring mile and a quarter from the camp which we reached about 6 20 feeling that we had had enough for one day when walking here we generally take a straight line by the compass both going and coming we can never go more than two miles an hour as the country is very rough sometimes we come to a mass of fallen trees which have to be clambered over sometimes to a deep ravine with a thick growth of young fir trees which we have to push our way through the ground all the time being rough and stony full of holes and covered with rotten and fallen trees occasionally we chance on a green swamp with from three to twelve inches of water in it though many of them are nearly dry these we go straight across taking advantage of trees lying upon them sometimes in the bush we find gigantic trees blown down and lying in our direction then we have a fair path for from 200 to 300 feet but rather slippery and ending in small we go exploring chasms from ten to thirty feet in depth we have our boots nailed in order to be able to walk on these trees without slipping as sometimes they have no bark and on others it is wet or very loose we have bathed two or three times but the beach is not nice as it has quantities of barnacles on the stones which make it decidedly unpleasant there was a good deal of rain yesterday though it soon cleared up again we hardly felt it under the trees
