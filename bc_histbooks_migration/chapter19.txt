december dick and i have been staying with b in toronto for a few days when we left b there was a foot and a half of snow on the ground and we were quite prepared to spend the night in the train the first train took one hour to do the three miles between b and c it had two engines and only two cars however we were only an hour late taking six and a half hours to do 4 2 52 christmas ninety miles we had had a snowstorm during the whole of the two days before we left and it was just clearing a little when we did leave on the day before we left we had a shooting match which was almost extinguished by the snow we had to stand inside a building and shoot at a mark outside there were only four turkeys competed for and i got two and dick one we paid ten cents apiece for shots and we each had three shots we sold the turkeys to mrs b for fifty cents apiece the long boots which we brought out here are splendid i spent two days walking about in snow sometimes three or four feet deep and my feet never got damp by loosening the laces too we can make them quite warm the corduroy trousers are also very warm i expect when you receive this letter you will be making preparations for the christmas dinner such as stirring the plum pudding etc we were back at b in time to help in the big stir i was cutting up beef five or christmas 53 six days ago and i cut a round weighing over thirty pounds to be spiced for christmas do you know i am getting quite an expert butcher now i can cut up a beef quicker than you could believe when we returned to b we found that our work had become much easier sawing and splitting wood feeding horses and cattle and sleigh driving were our chief occupations as yet we have had no snow shoeing or skating but the sleighing o o o o is simply splendid you go along so smoothly with a light swinging motion and as it is cold you are able to let the horses go at full speed without their getting hot you asked in your last letter about white foxes once or twice they have come down as far as here but very seldom there are minx however and plenty of partridges and rabbits everything now is in a state of great preparation for christmas three great rounds of beef are being spiced in the cellar in the evening we go and help decorate the church as there is no holly 54 sleighing here all the decorations are in swamp cedar a tree which looks something like an arbor vitas the sleighing is very good now though the snow is only four inches deep lately we have been doing some teaming dick o o has charge of one team and i of another we have great fun sometimes when there are a lot of boys round they run and try to get on to the back of the sleigh and then we either go so fast as to prevent them getting on or swing them off going round the corners the sleighs are built like this j z7 g z the top of the sleigh is constructed so as to turn on the runners so that when you go sharply round a corner the back runners swing right round and run out to one side for a few moments it is almost impossible then to a little real cold 55 hold on to it here is a sketch of the position of a sleigh turning a corner
