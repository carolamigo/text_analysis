may we started from victoria on friday 6th and made about forty miles getting mto a small bay maple bay at 10 30 p m next morning the wind was strong and squally and we did not start till late it was an awful job the getting out of the bay for we had to tack right across it several times and when we did get into the open a big a rough voyage 101 squall came and we had to let the mainsail fly and then haul it down the jib blew out of the bolt ropes directly after and we rushed up the coast at the rate often miles an hour under bare poles alone we got into horse shoe bay chemainus at 3 wet through though we got warm at the last the greek dick and myself taking the rowing boat and towing the sloop down the bay to the wharf we found an inn where we dried our clothes and had tea sleeping there on sunday night as well on monday we camped for the night on the north end of thetis island we lit a fire and had coffee and biscuits butter hot potatoes and fish we cut some poles and rigged up a big tarpaulin as a tent and then put the boughs off the fir poles on the ground and spread the bedding on them and the four of us slept on the top the greek always sleeps in the boat in the morning after breakfast we started 102 a rough voyage again the tides run very strong on this coast and when we reached a place called dod s narrows which is about seventy yards across the tide running through at about ten knots and the wind falling we could not steer the boat one bit w had one of the long oars out and pulled a bit on one side to keep us off the rocks and went on pulling a few seconds too long and we got caught in the whirlpool on the further side below the rapids and were flung round twice quite helpless and he not taking his oar out of the water quick enough got a dig in the ribs from the end of it i got hold of the other oar and when we got clear of the whirlpool we pulled away as hard as we could however we could get no wind and about a mile from the rapids we stopped to get some lunch before long we found that a back current was taking us back to the rapids at about three knots an hour so we started to pull again the wind came for a short time and took us a rough voyage 103 on our way a bit then it stopped and we had to tow into nanaimo where we had tea beds and breakfast all this time we have been going north along the east coast f vancouver island in among all the little islands we started from nanaimo in the morning with a good wind and crossed to the mainland ten miles and coasted up to normanby island where we camped sleeping on the boat for fear of wolves next morning we started again up the channel between texada island and the mainland but having no wind only did ten miles and then towed into an inlet on the mainland where we camped the same thing happened next day and after making ten miles we towed into a bay at the north east part of texada island starting again next morning the wind failed us and we towed into this harbour our destination w and k sleep in a tent and dick and i in an old log hut with no doors 104 our destination or windows and only one third of the floor down here the cooking is done with a stove and it serves as general living room w and k have been making gigantic efforts to bake bread and till the last time made it rather like lead the cooking is a terrible job to them every meal and it sounds very amusing to hear them blame everything but the cook the wood the stove those who cut the wood those who light the fire all get a share of the credit for heavy bread etc we have not done much exploring yet but at present the island seems to me all rocks and stones and one or two swamp meadows w however seems much taken with it i went over to comox vancouver island two days ago the land there is first rate but most of it is taken up harwood island too as far as we could see would be a very nice place we may find good land on this island when we have explored it a bit more last our destination 105 night the cove here was swarming with dogfish and they made a tremendous noise rushing about i was lying on a log at the edge of the rocks and pulled four out by their tails in about six minutes we had a bathe but the water was cold there are a few big trees on this island we saw some yesterday which would have squared to four feet one hundred feet from the ground and were seven or eight in diameter at the base
